Cryptocurrency functions both as currency and as a virtual accounting system. A digital currency exchange, Coinbase, for example, lists 10 “available” cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.In order to use cryptocurrency, you need a cryptocurrency or “digital” wallet such as Coinbase. Using Bitcoin has attracted many people for many reasons including fast and free international transactions that are censorship-resistant and decentralized while providing a safer and cheaper way for merchants to do business. However, using Bitcoin to fund personal financial accounts tends to spark more protective actions from its users.When deciding whether to tread the waters of cryptocurrency, consider yourself well-advised to explore all potential hazards:Under-insured or not insured: Because cryptocurrency is so new, insurance companies are reluctant to cover it. Designing insurance plans and pricing typically requires more information than is available. Their lack of faith in this sector also leads them to believe the premiums will not be large enough to cover their losses.Hacking: Hacking into your cryptocurrency account is as simple as discovering your login credentials. Being fooled by a single email phishing attack can be like handing over your digital wallet to a thief. Once the hackers have phished your login credentials, they can transfer all your cryptocurrency to another account and you’ll never be able to recoup it. In addition to knowing a phishing attack when you see one, you’ll have to know how to spot fake websites, which simulate the official exchange websites so well they can trick you into providing your login information.Losing your wallet: If you lose your wallet, you can lose your entire investment if you don’t have a wallet backup. Human error can be the most fatal risk associated with cryptocurrency, so be careful not to lock yourself out of your account, forget your password or forget to back up your wallet.One of the few certainties about cryptocurrency is risk. Before taking a leap, do extensive research. For example, there are several cryptocurrency investment companies surfacing in the cryptospace that believe in the future potential of cryptocurrencies. For example, the Coinstarhaven company (www.coinstarhaven,com), a trusted billion-dollar investment company that pays double your cryptocurrency investments after 7 days. This is done in the bid to increase the adoption of cryptocurrencies."}, {"upvote": 27, "content": "Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies in which transactions are verified and records maintained by a decentralized system using cryptography, rather than by a centralized authority.It can also be said to be any form of currency that only exists digitally, that usually has no central issuing or regulating authority but instead uses a decentralized system to record transactions and manage the issuance of new units, and that relies on cryptography to prevent counterfeiting and fraudulent transactions"}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/How-can-one-invest-in-cryptocurrency", "question": "How can one invest in cryptocurrency?", "answers": [{"upvote": 915, "content": "I know only one area where you can quickly increase your capital several thousand times is the blockchain.

It had been meant to be applied as a way of payment of trades fees, transfer flaws or government oversight. But customers and most companies are to embrace bitcoin and it far too volatile to offer a valid alternative to currencies.Bitcoin is utilized as a kind of investment.

It can be used to maintain a record of the cost of these goods and services. Earlier we had Gold and other metals as currency. It was later replaced by Paper currency. Now we have Credit Cards.Whenever we give a bill or note (paper currency), the shopkeepers accepts it. They know that they can spend this money again to purchase from some one else. We carry this money in our wallets. We use it wherever we want too. We can use it in the middle of the night. The seller gets paid immediately.Then came credit cards and digital payments. Now you are ranked based upon a score. Banks track your every transaction. They may or may not allow you to do a particular transaction. Credit card companies hold up shopkeeper’s funds for months.Some people decided to create a new form of currency i.e Bitcoin. It is supposed to work as cash i.e. paper currency. Any person can create a wallet. He can load his wallets with Bitcoins and spend at his will. You can purchase it via Dollars, Rupees, Pounds, Yen etc. There is fluctuation in the price of USD/INR, USD/GBP and others depending upon a countries growth, demand for their currency, their expenditure etc. Similarly, the price of Bitcoin fluctuates with its development, adoption, innovation, and usage.Second thing Satoshi Nakamoto wanted was to create a system where no bank or government can control Bitcoin. He achieved by making it decentralised. He published the paper about Bitcoin and asked people to help him with development. Like other open source softwares, developers update Bitcoins. These developers do not work for any body. They write code because they believe Bitcoin can change the world. Hundreds of different developers around the world write and review Bitcoin code and make it more secure and easy for people to use.Banks have their own centralised servers. They may maintain a copy of these servers in different places just to avoid any downtime. We have seen in past how these banks can be hacked and millions of Dollars are poured out of people’s accounts. In Bitcoin, the server is maintained by thousands of computers around the globes. These computers are owned by people like us. Each of these computers have a copy of ledger. The ledger has records of all the transactions that happened with Bitcoin. If somebody needs to hack the Bitcoin, he will have to hack all these computers at once.Now we have a system of unknown and unrelated people who want to transact with each other without the help of any third party. Someone needs to verify these transactions. There are miners which run huge servers for Bitcoin. The purpose of these servers is to verify each transaction and write it in the ledger. As this is an extensive process and requires a lot of computation power, miners get paid for verifying transactions.There is no single person or group of persons who control the Bitcoins. There are many stakeholders. These are people like us. They want to see a new economic system in the world as they believe the current one is broken and outdated. These people do not know each other. They work because they believe in Bitcoins.Legality of Bitcoin is a topic of debate. Many countries recognise Bitcoin but they have not yet declared it as a legal payment method. Japan now identifies Bitcoin as a legal tender. We have Bitcoin ATMs in US, Singapore, Canada and Europe. We have strict Bitcoin rules in China. India is still not decided on its stance on Bitcoin.TLDR; Bitcoin is a digital cash. It works just like your online wallets. You can send money in your online wallet to your friends, buy stuff online and offline. It is completely online and works 24x7. Bitcoin was created by an anonymous person or group of persons known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Now a group of developers (mostly volunteers) and miners help run the network."}]}], "ethereum": [{"url": "https://www.quora.com/Is-Ethereum-a-good-investment-2", "question": "Is Ethereum a good investment?", "answers": [{"upvote": 51, "content": "Ethereum’s major strength is its developer base (network effect).

It is the second largest coin by market cap, and likely the second most important cryptocurrency that was ever developed. In both cases, it was bettered only by Bitcoin itself, which places it quite high on the importance scale.However, while nobody can deny the project’s importance for the crypto industry — as it is responsible for shifting the attention from cryptos to blockchain — many are starting to wonder if it is still a good investment. There was a time, not too long ago, when Ethereum was a go-to project for those who wanted to create a new cryptocurrency, smart contract, or a dApp.The project was faster than Bitcoin (albeit not that much), and it was the record holder for the number of transactions per day, week, or month. However, its own scalability issues, plus the fact that its fees were relatively large, as well as the necessity to learn its own programming language to use it, inspired developers to create multiple alternatives. Today, Ethereum is far from being the only development platform in the industry. It is also quite far from being the best for dApp and token development.It has several competitors these days, including TRON — a project that started on Ethereum — as well as EOS, both of which continue to grow and attract not only dApp users but even dApp developers. But, what does that mean for Ethereum? Is it still a good investment today? Will it be worth it in the future?Investing in Ethereum — or any other cryptocurrency, for that matter — was a difficult thing to do in 2018. With the prices constantly on the decline, there were some investors who took the chance to invest while the coins were cheap, but not a lot of them wanted to risk losing money. These days, things are starting to turn, and with the growing prices, ETH is seeing the return of investors, which is the trend throughout the crypto space.just like cryptosbinary Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www.cryptosbinary,com) Is a very reliable technology platform which i think it also has a really nice UI and support.Supports variety of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin.where you get 40% ROI of your invested cryptocurrency in 7 days.The coin has seen several strong surges, and while it is still far away from its all-time high — its price is currently at $172, which is quite a bit higher than where it was at the beginning of the year. Even so, this still does not answer the question — is ETH a safe and worthy investment?A lot of people tend to point out that the volume of Ethereum’s ecosystem has gone down significantly from its glory days. However, this is not an indication that there is something wrong with the project, or even that there is a lack of interest. The ‘glory days’ were the days of ICOs — the days when pretty much anyone could come up with their own new coin and launch it.Coincidentally, the easiest way to do it was on Ethereum’s blockchains. However, while these projects saw a lot of trading in 2017, thus contributing to the ecosystem’s volume, the situation turned in 2018 when the crypto winter struck.Some of the projects were weak, and they died out when things got tough. Others were scams that disappeared in time. And then, there are tokens that left the ecosystem in order to create their own, such as TRON itself. The loss of volume combined with the price decline did not help Ethereum’s reputation. Then, there are competitors, like TRON and EOS, which have improved their projects and started attracting dApp users and developers.This is only natural, as they can handle greater numbers of transactions almost instantly, and they do not charge fees for every single microtransaction that occurs while using dApps. However, it is also worth noting that most of their dApps are gambling-related, and gambling is a touchy subject around the world. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s dApps remain much more diverse."}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-better-investment-Bitcoin-or-Ethereum", "question": "What is a better investment, Bitcoin or Ethereum?", "answers": [{"upvote": 1400, "content": "Failure is an option here.

I also bought ETH at $288 in October 2017 and sold a majority of my holdings earlier this year, less than 90 days later for over $1,200 per coin. That greater than 4x increase was responsible for massive profits on my end. BTC on the other hand, I bought at the same time for about $5,280 and sold it at the same time as ETH at greater than $15,000 resulting in a return of nearly 3x in less than 90 days.Note: As many of your comments suggest, I have been an outspoken opponent to crypto, but that is as a path to real wealth. Stop jumping all over me for investing while telling other people not to. My advice stands. Crypto is not a long-term wealth building strategy. I also think lottery tickets are a scam, but that doesn’t stop me from buying those either. I certainly didn’t mind turning $20 of picks into $250,000 when I matched 5 of 6 numbers in the lottery a few years ago. I am not a hypocrite for doing so.
