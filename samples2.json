But other than both being cryptocurrencies, they don\\u2019t have much in common. Bitcoin is a payment system and Ethereum is a smart contract platform. They do different things in different ways for different purposes. So comparing Bitcoin and Ether is like comparing apples and oranges.\\n\\nBitcoin the Apple\\n\\nBitcoin is the first decentralized cryptocurrency that was ever created. It was founded in 2009 by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto and all other cryptos are modeled after Bitcoin in one way, shape or form. It was created in reaction to the 2008 financial crisis and has always been seen as a way to escape the banks. It is:\\n\\n * Decentralized\\n * Trustless\\n * Open\\n * Secure\\nIt is primarily a payment system and does not scale well but gains more security in return. It can only do the simplest smart contracts and it\\u2019s main code does not update frequently (which also makes it more secure). There are several projects like the Lightning Network and RSK that are attempting to solve some of these problems with layer 2 solutions. At this point, these solutions have not taken off.\\n\\nPros\\n\\nImagine Facebook with only Mark Zuckerberg using it. How valuable would it be? Pretty much zero. Add billions of people on to Facebook and now you have a company worth billions of dollars. That is the power of network effects and Bitcoin has the largest network of any cryptocurrency. As of today, Bitcoin has over 5 million active users, but it\\u2019s really hard to tell how many people are actually using it (which is part of its charm). Regardless, it\\u2019s network effect is one of the best things going for it. There are plenty of businesses, investment firms and users who will accept Bitcoin as payment.\\n\\nIf you look at how Bitcoin has performed over the past ten years, it has proven itself as a great store of value. You could have bought one for less than a penny in 2010 and now it\\u2019s worth 10,000 USD. I do not know of a single investment in the history of the world that has performed that well.\\n\\nThe final thing going for Bitcoin is the limit of Bitcoins that will be made. There will be 21 million Bitcoin mined by 2140 and after that no more Bitcoin will be created. Today, there is roughly 18.5 Million BTC already in existence. This means there is only another 2.5 million Bitcoin left to mine. The supply of Bitcoin is low; the only thing needed to raise its value astronomically is demand.\\n\\nCons\\n\\nIt\\u2019s biggest cons are its slow transaction speeds, bad reputation from the Silk Road, lack of smart contracts and the fact that it\\u2019s not user-friendly. Most of these problems will be fixed over the next decade:\\n\\n * The Lightning Network or some other layer 2 solution will be implemented to speed up transactions.\\n * The Silk Road has been closed for years and Bitcoin is used for legitimate purposes.\\n * New and better cryptocurrency wallets come out all the time. These will make sending and receiving Bitcoin easier for the average user. I look at Wallets like Divi Project 2.0, Monarch and the OKEx Wallet [ https://www.okex.com/wallet?channelFlag=ACE504505 ] as options that will bring new comers to crypto.\\n * Smart contracts have already been solved for Bitcoin. Ethereum has already implemented \\u201cwrapped Bitcoin\\u201d. A token that represents Bitcoin is placed on the Ethereum network and Bitcoins are locked away on a 1:1 basis to make sure the wrapped Bitcoin is maintained. You can easily use smart contracts and Defi to trade Bitcoin.\\nHere is the main question: How long will it take to solve these problems? If it takes too long, other blockchains may pass up Bitcoin. If the problems are solved in a timely manner, then Bitcoin will likely keep its place at the top.\\n\\nEthereum the World of Smart Contracts\\n\\nTrustless agreements\\n\\nVitalik Buterin proposed Ethereum in 2013 and launched it in 2015. He had been active in the blockchain space for a long time, but soon realized that Bitcoin was too limited. He compared Bitcoin to a pocket calculator that does one thing and does it well. Ethereum is compared to a smartphone that can have apps installed on it. Ethereum is able to run smart contracts and decentralized applications. It does not just do financial applications, it is also able to run blockchain games, decentralized exchanges (DEX) and other applications using NFT\\u2019s and tokens. It is:\\n\\n * Decentralized\\n * Trustless\\n * Open\\n * Not as secure as Bitcoin\\n * Runs smart contracts\\nPros\\n\\nEthereum is the first cryptocurrency smart contract system. Like Bitcoin, it has a huge network-effect advantage. There are thousands of developers already working on the Ethereum system. There are thousands of tokens and smart contracts currently running on the Ethereum network. There are famous DEXs like Uniswap that make exchanging cryptocurrency trustless. Ethereum is where the people and the programs are.\\n\\nI don\\u2019t know how else to emphasize this, but network effect is a BIG deal! No other smart contract system has as many users or developers as Ethereum. It has proven itself valuable and useful. When it first came out, you could purchase it for 0.58 USD; now it goes for 2604 (5/19/2021) dollars. Not a bad return on investment! Most of all, there are many useful blockchain projects running on it that require Ethereum. There is:\\n\\n * Basic Attention Token (Brave Browser)\\n * Uniswap\\n * Loopring\\n * Celsius\\n * Crypto Kitties\\n * God\\u2019s Unchained\\n * Enjin\\n * Mana (Decentraland)\\n * Storj\\nAnd a whole lot of other projects. To participate in any of the countless projects running on the Ethereum network you must use a little bit of Ether. This almost guarantees the need for people to acquire and purchase Ether in the future.\\n\\nBefore I go on I must point out that Ethereum seems to be hosting another bubble. The last time it was the ICO boom now it is the Defi movement. It is very easy to be hard on the ICO Boom because there were many failed projects (and some scams) but we must also remember it birthed many great projects we love like: Divi Project, BAT, Storj, EOS, Binance, Cardano and more. Likewise, the Defi movement will have projects that are here to stay and many that will fail and exit scam. No matter what you think about the Defi movement it does reveal the need for the Ethereum Network.\\n\\nCons\\n\\nEthereum does have a lot more problems than Bitcoin.\\n\\n * More security issues\\n * More scaling issues\\n * More (and better) competitors\\n * A major problem with upgrading the software\\nSecurity Issues\\n\\nWriting a smart contract is difficult. Writing a smart contract that won\\u2019t get hacked is even harder. Making a smart contract system that makes it easier for developers to do things right is even more difficult. There are plenty of smart contracts out there with security holes waiting for smart hackers to take advantage of.\\n\\nScaling Issues\\n\\nEthereum is slow. It\\u2019s not as slow as Bitcoin, but it has a much higher volume of transactions. The average Defi user does several Ethereum transactions a day (even several in an hour); the average Bitcoin user might do a few in a day. This makes Ethereum transactions take a long time (sometimes days), makes the fees outrageous, and even cause lost transactions. It\\u2019s annoying and makes people wish they could use another smart contract system. Which brings us to\\u2026\\n\\nThe Competition\\n\\nEthereum has better competition than Bitcoin. It has:\\n\\n * EOS\\n * Cardano\\n * Polkadot\\n * Tron\\n * Neo\\n * Tezos\\n * VEChain\\n * Cosmos\\n * IOTA\\n * Waves\\n * Zilliqa\\n * Elastos\\n * Thunder Token\\n * Harmony Protocol\\nAnd these were just the ones I could list off the top of my head! There are a lot of great projects that want to take Ethereum\\u2019s place\\u2026 and it only takes one. Or 2\\u20133 could always replace Ethereum as well. Once could specialize in blockchain games, one could specialize in Dapps and another could do Defi.\\n\\nEthereum 2.0\\n\\nAnd out comes the nervous monkey\\n\\nEthereum 2.0 was supposed to launch in 2018. Two years later and it still hasn\\u2019t happened. Ethereum 2.0 is supposed to make Ethereum more scalable, faster, a proof-of-stake system that would blow its competitors out of the water. The longer it takes, the more likely a blockchain like Cardano can get its act together and overtake Ethereum. What will happen? Only time will tell.\\n\\nBut Which is Better? Answer the Quora Question!\\n\\nThis is like asking if Microsoft stock or Ford stock is better. They are completely different companies. I think Bitcoin is safer. It\\u2019s less likely to get hacked and it is already accepted by large investment firms like Grayscale (but then so is Ethereum). If you want a crypto that you can just buy and forget about I would choose Bitcoin. It has so far proven itself a store of value. If you want a crypto that you are likely to use then I would choose Ethereum; especially if you want to play with all of it\\u2019s Dapps.\\n\\nI do think Ethereum could be overtaken by a competitor. I don\\u2019t see a store of value system that will overtake Bitcoin anytime soon. Once again Bitcoin is less risky but Ethereum could give you bigger gains.\\n\\nPersonally, I think you should buy a bit of both. As Ecclesiastes says invest in many ventures.\\n\\nEcclesiastes 11:1\\u20136\\n\\n\\n%3E Ship your grain across the sea;\\n after many days you may receive a return.\\n Invest in seven ventures, yes, in eight;\\n you do not know what disaster may come upon the land.\\n\\nIf clouds are full of water,\\n they pour rain on the earth.\\nWhether a tree falls to the south or to the north,\\n in the place where it falls, there it will lie.\\n Whoever watches the wind will not plant;\\n whoever looks at the clouds will not reap.\\n\\nAs you do not know the path of the wind,\\n or how the body is formed in a mother\\u2019s womb,\\nso you cannot understand the work of God,\\n the Maker of all things.\\n\\nSow your seed in the morning,\\n and at evening let your hands not be idle,\\nfor you do not know which will succeed,\\n whether this or that,\\n or whether both will do equally well.\\nSo decide how much risk you want and then divide between Bitcoin, Ether and some other cryptos (and stocks, bonds, precious metals and anything else that can round out your portfolio).\\n\\nAs always, I recommend you  [ https://www.okex.com/?channelFlag=ACEAP1502019 ]buy your Bitcoin and Ether from OKEx [ https://www.okex.com/buy-crypto?channelFlag=ACE504505 ].

Do you really have to decide between Bitcoin or Ethereum?\\n\\nLet\\u2019s look at what it means to invest in Bitcoin or Ethereum. Investing in cryptocurrency is typically associated with moving value from one asset class to another, with a view of generating a return on investment (ROI) over an expected time.\\n\\nIf your goal is just to make more money, then you are trying to choose the project that you think will go up in value the most. If the demand outgrows the supply of people willing to sell over a given time, then you can expect your investment to be profitable. You need to look at their distinct aspects of supply and use cases (demand) when choosing between Bitcoin or Ethereum. Let 's start by analyzing the supply side:\\n\\nSUPPLY COMPARISON\\n\\nBitcoin\\n\\n * Circulating Supply of 17.3 Million BTC\\n * Maximum supply of 21 Million BTC\\n * Supply inflation rate of approximately 3.56% (inflation rate halves every 4 years\\nEthereum:\\n\\n * Circulating supply of 108.28 Million ETH.\\n * Max supply is unknown\\n * Supply inflation rate of approximately 4.49% annually\\nChoosing Bitcoin or Ethereum\\n\\nAlthough Bitcoin and Ethereum are both cryptocurrencies they have very different platforms and use cases.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s start with Bitcoin.\\n\\nThe base Bitcoin platform has a very simple use case \\u2013 send Bitcoins between participants in a very secure, reliable and censorship-resistant way. The secure part comes from a robust blockchain of mining hardware (around $1.3 Billion value) and nodes (10,000 publicly reachable).\\n\\nThe reliable aspect comes from the fact that the network has been running smoothly at 99% since the time of its inception. The censorship resistance comes from the fact that if you broadcast a transaction with a sufficiently high fee attached, it is near enough impossible to stop the transaction being accepted by the network. These characteristics give it a great \\u2018store of value\\u2019 use case as a platform.\\n\\nEthereum, on the other hand, was focused on being a smart contracts platform. It also has mining hardware, nodes, reliability and censorship resistance but nowhere near as much as the Bitcoin network. Ethereum is built to be a smart contract platform with many projects and decentralised applications (dApps) being run on the network. The dApp and smart contract use case is growing each day with more and more contracts being created and users transacting volume through this network.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nIn summary, it\\u2019s hard to pick what the better investment would be between Bitcoin or Ethereum if you are only doing it to make more money. There are unknowns about the supply of Ethereum, the platforms have very different use cases and the demand for each of them (Store of Value vs Smart Contract Platform) is changing each day.\\n\\nBoth assets have shown to be extremely volatile in price over the last few years and, for that reason, both should be considered as being in the high-risk investment category.\\n\\nWant to learn more about cryptocurrencies?

I\\u2019d only add a couple thoughts:\\n\\nICOs - There appears to be a relationship between ethereum\\u2019s price and ICO sales \\u2013 although the extent of this relationship remains unclear \\u2013 it seems reasonable to suggest that the conclusion of a series of mega ICOs - which were paid for by ETH valued at hundreds of millions of USD - will result in some downwards pressure on ethereum\\u2019s price in the short term. The sponsors of these ICOs will naturally want to sell / hedge the value of the ETH they received.\\n\\n(as an aside, this assumes all of these sponsors do the \\u2018right thing\\u2019 and look to match the currency composition of their pool of assets with the expected currency composition required for their expansion plans. What troubles me somewhat is that the entire reason these sponsors denominated their ICOs in ETH was because they were going to use that ETH to pay for the development and contracts on the system. If that\\u2019s true - why is there such massive selling? But, thinking like that may make you cynical about some of these ICOs\\u2026)\\n\\nEvidence of this can be seen in the image above. Ethereum\\u2019s price fell shortly after the Bancor, Status and TenX ICO. In combination, they raised more than $300 million worth of ETH through a simple smart contract that does not give investors any control over the funds.\\n\\nBecause the cryptocurrency markets are small, illiquid and volatile. As the market matures, ICOs should cause less volatility as:\\n\\n(a) investors needing to accumulate ETH, in advance of preparing to invest in a new ICO will mitigate the selling pressure from the sponsors of the last ICO hedging their proceeds and\\n\\n(b) quantitative investors will develop ways to measure this supply/demand imbalance and arbitrage away any pricing inefficiencies.\\n\\nBut, right now, with no compelling ICOs in the near future, the selling pressure is immense\\n\\nSegWit2x and the High Net Worth Community - SegWit2x is a BTC event - not an ETH event. Still, it highlights how little we really can predict about these currencies. For the past 50 years, when there is uncertainty in the markets, investors have flocked to gold - which is a terrible alternative. Then came BTC and ETH. Now, these same HNW investors are coming to realize that crypto is another alternative - further, unlike gold, the supply of crypto is predictable - AND - it offers some unprecedented tax avoidance strategies. I\\u2019d suggest that some of ETH\\u2019s rise is the result of portfolio reallocation from HNW and Ultra HNW investors.\\n\\nHowever, to these investors, the risk of losing money is far scarier than the prospect of earning a good return. I\\u2019ll spare everyone my \\u201cworkers of the world unite\\u201d speech for now. But, I\\u2019d suggest most very wealthy people know they couldn\\u2019t re-acquire the wealth they have now.

The right word is \\u201cMoney Supply\\u201d or even \\u201cMonetary Base\\u201d When you take this money supply and multiply it by how many times a coin changes hands during a year (monetary velocity), you get GDP\\n\\nFor a currency like ETH, I\\u2019d suggest the number of coins x price per coin is only relevant if you understand what kind of transactional value it generates.

By itself, it really doesn\\u2019t tell you anything.\\u2026 But, if you assume monetary velocity is around 4.6x, then you come to our GDP of $17 trillion. While this is a bit of an oversimplification, in the world of crypto currency, this is exactly how it works.\\n\\nCurrencies have no intrinsic value.

Users of the network can create, publish, monetize, and use applications on the platform, as well as use the Ether cryptocurrency as payment. Insiders refer to the network's decentralized applications as \\\"dApps.\\\" Ethereum, as a cryptocurrency, is only second in market value to Bitcoin.\\n\\nEthereum provides everyone, regardless of background or location, with open access to digital money and data-friendly services. It's the technology that powers the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and millions of apps available today.\\n\\nTo trade Ethereum or ETH, investors use cryptocurrency exchange platforms or cryptocurrency trading platforms like BuyUcoin [ https://www.buyucoin.com ].\\n\\nEthereum vs. Ether\\n\\nTo create new currencies or decentralized apps on the Ethereum network, developers must pay a fee to the network. They use ether, Ethereum's native currency, to make these payments. According to Noble, this price is also known as \\\"gas.\\\"\\n\\nGas is the cost of using the system, similar to paying a subway fare to ride the train. Ether is the currency you'd use to buy a MetroCard. Consider it \\\"like tolls\\\" that must be paid in order to conduct things and trade on Ethereum, according to Noble. Varying acts are worth different amounts of ether, and as more individuals join the network, the fees rise.\\n\\nThe rise in Ether's value over the years can be explained by these gas prices, as well as all the uses developers are paying to investigate. As more developers attempt to build products on Ethereum, they will need to buy more ether to cover gas fees, which will raise the price of ether. Ether investors are counting on the most widely used blockchain's continuous use and the future possibilities of its uses.\\n\\nAccording to Noble, gas fees are also one of the most significant impediments to Ethereum's future expansion. However, Ethereum 2.0, a network update now in development, is attempting to address the problem.\\n\\nWhere and How to buy Ethereum in India?\\n\\nThe simplest way to obtain buy Ethereum (ETH) in India is to purchase it on an exchange or through a brokerage firm. Depending on the provider, you may be able to use a bank transfer, a credit card, or PayPal to pay. Fast verification and high-speed trading are available on this well-known Indian cryptocurrency exchange, BuyUcoin.\\n\\nStep 1 - Create a Digital Wallet and Register\\n\\nThe first step to buy Ethereum in India is to open a digital wallet. A digital wallet stores and safeguards your cryptocurrencies. To register visit the BuyUcoin website and click on register/signup [ https://trade.buyucoin.com/signup ]. Provide your email id, a secure password, choose the mode of operation Individual or Corpotare(for business and institutions). Then you need to verify your personal details.\\n\\nStep 2 - Complete KYC process\\n\\nKYC is mandatory in Indian jurisdiction. You will be redirected to another URL/web address to complete the KYC. You need a picture of your PAN card and Aadhar card along with your recent selfie.\\n\\nStep 3 - Complete 2 Factor Authentication\\n\\nDownload the authenticator app from the play store or app store and enable it. You can enable it by scanning the QR code shown or by entering the 6 digits code shown on the screen. When enabled, you will be prompted to provide a six-digit one-time password in addition to your email address and password each time you log in to your BuyUcoin account.\\n\\nStep 4 - Bank Details\\n\\nAdd the credentials of your bank name, holder account name followed by account number, and IFSC code details. And verify it by providing a copy of either Cancel Cheque or Recent Bank Statement.\\n\\nReasons to Invest in Ethereum\\n\\nIf you had invested $5,000 in Ethereum (ETH) at the start of the year, your investment would now be worth more than $22,360. Ethereum is extremely popular, with over 116 billion coins in the hands of investors.\\n\\nEthereum network is progressing far beyond making unidimensional monetary transfers like Bitcoin (BTC) or even smart contracts.

More than I would recommend anyone hold. Part of the reasons I hold so much are described below when I talk about the upcoming Ethereum Merge.\\n\\nThe price of anything: a stock, a house, a book, crypto, etc is 100% based on supply and demand. The \\u201cfundamentals\\u201d are secondary but they are the reasons why supply and demand might go up and down.\\n\\nAll of the other things, \\u201ccandlesticks\\u201d, \\u201ctechnical analysis\\u201d, etc is BS in the long run. The only things that are important are: SUPPLY, the reasons an asset will increase or decrease in supply, and why DEMAND will go up or down.\\n\\nEthereum, as opposed to Bitcoin, is being used for 1000s of crypto-based projects. There are more transactions per day on Ethereum than Bitcoin. Which usually surprises people when they hear this.\\n\\n(this trend will continue)\\n\\nMany people still say \\u201ccrypto is a fad\\u201d. Just like people said \\u201cthe web is a fad\\u201d all the way up until 2005.\\n\\nYou know what happened in 2005?\\n\\nThe Web hit 1,000,000,000 users.\\n\\nCrypto will hit that soon. Perhaps next year or year after. And it\\u2019s only THEN, that crypto will truly explode.\\n\\nBut the biggest thing that will effect the price (i.e. the supply and demand of Ethereum) is the upcoming Ethereum Merge.\\n\\nWhy The Ethereum Merge Will Shoot UP the Price of ETH\\n\\n1: Supply will shrink\\n\\nWith any PoW (proof of work) coin, the miners have to pay their electricity bills each day by selling their coins. Once ETH moves to proof of stake, the electric bills go down by 99.7%. Less selling pressure each day.\\n\\n2: Supply will shrink, part II\\n\\nBecause proof of stake requires miners to stake coins, that removes those coins from supply. In every test case where proof of stake has been tried , supply of ETH has gone down. Less supply and EQUAL demand = price goes up.\\n\\n3: Supply will shrink, Part III.\\n\\nThis has already been happening but will happen more as ETH goes up: part of every gas fee means more ETH is burned according to the \\\"London Upgrade\\\" that happened in July, 2021.\\n\\n4: Demand will go up\\n\\nSInce ETH will presumably be faster (PoW takes longer to calculate than PoS), ETH will be more scalable and more projects will want to use ETH. ETH already has more transactions per day than BTC and with increased scalability and less energy usage demand will go even higher. Demand up + Supply down = ETH will go up.\\n\\n5: Demand will go up, part II\\n\\nBecause staking Ethereum will be rewarded with more ETH, investors will want to stake their ETH. But in order to stake it, you have to buy it. So more buying pressures.\\n\\n6: Demand will go up, Part III\\n\\nABout $10 billion a quarter is being invested by venture capital firms in crypto projects. With the ETH merge (and the fact that ETH is used for about 95% of crypto projects), more projects will launch than ever before. $50 billion has been invested this past year on projects that will launch within the next year or so: Defi projects, real world use cases, NFT projects, etc. This will increase demand.\\n\\nFor instance, may DeFi exchanges are powered by Ethereum. If you don\\u2019t understand DeFi, don\\u2019t worry. Decentralized Finance exchanges will eventually allow everything you can conceive of (not just a \\u201cstock\\u201d or a \\u201cbond\\u201d) to be traded like a financial asset.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s the growth in DeFi:\\n\\n7: After the Merge, ETH will do something called \\\"Sharding\\\", which will increase scalability\\n\\nSharding decentralizes the data so not every validator has to have all of the data. It's a bit tricky so I wont 'explain it all here but sharding means ETH becomes much more scalable. It's estimated that the number of ETH transactions per second could go from a small 13 to a huge 100,000 (Visa is at 65,000). Scalability will increase demand because potentially ETH can be used as a currency for transactions.\\n\\n8: Supply will go down, Part IV and Demand will go up, Part IV\\n\\nThis may or may not occur but will probably reduce supply slightly. Part of ETH 2 is that a validator of transactions risks losing their staked coins if they validate a fraudulent transaction. With PoW, the risk of validating a bad transaction is you have to eat your electricity costs. But with PoS, you could lose your stake. So two things occur: some stake will eventually get burned because of this. But also, the risks go up, so there is more incentive to triple check any transactions being validated. So the increased safety could increase demand.\\n\\n(VC dollars going into crypto projects will eventually go into buying more ETH).\\n\\n9: People are waiting for the merge before investing\\n\\nThis is just speculation on my part but I think many people are waiting for ETH 2.0 to happen before investing. Partly because this is the advice many pundits on TV are giving. That said, interest has gone up significantly. Here is the Google Trends chart on the search \\\"Ethereum Merge\\\" over the past 12 months.\\n\\n(in anticipation of the merge, Ethereum has been decoupling in price from Bitcoin).\\n\\n10: Significant players in the crypto space don't even think the merge will happen.\\n\\nThis is a very good thing. It means that some people who hold enormous influence will have to change their tune publicly once the merge happens and this wll drive buying interest. For instance, Kevin O'Leary (Mr. Wonderful on Shark Tank, and the founder of WonderFi) said to me on my podcast the merge will never happen. Not sure why he believes that. Meanwhile, the merge has recently completed several successful large-scale tests and is now scheduled for September 19. This merge will happen. Maybe not in Sept but it will happen, which will generate new buying interest.\\n\\n11: Eth seems to be moving up faster than BTC\\n\\nUsually ETH price follows BTC price. But over the past week (since the latest ETH Merge test and the announcement of a scheduled date for the merge) ETH price has gone up 7.4% and BTC has gone up a little over 1%. This is a short term trend so probably doesn't mean anything but I am watching to see if it continues.,"}, {"upvote": 6, "content": "It could, yes, but you ask about an increase in value close to 50 times from current value.

Although as we can see, there is a sudden short-term drop to .78, yet Ethereum continues to be highly correlated to Bitcoin and keeps benefiting from this correlation.\\n\\nWhat path will Ethereum take? How much can the price of Ethereum go in 2021?\\n\\nEthereum\\u2019s three fundamental drivers anticipate one thing for 2021: Ethereum\\u2019s price will depend on the success of Defi and the launch of Ethereum 2.0.\\n\\nETH will go to $1000 in a few short weeks, and then $5000\\n\\nWell, to better understand the situation, we need to compare it to 2017 when the crypto boom occurred. At that time, Bitcoin halving gave a boost to cryptocurrencies in 2017, as halving had occurred in 2016, i.e. the previous year, and its impact was immediately noticed in the following year.\\n\\nThus, since Ethereum and Bitcoin are correlated, Ivan on Tech might be just right, and we could witness Ethereum reaching $5000 in 2021! Ethereum and Bitcoin will likely rise in price drastically together in 2021.\\n\\nThis is actually possible because let\\u2019s not forget that Ethereum knows how to surprise. In the past, Ethereum rallied from $0.25 per coin to an all-time high of over $1,400 per coin in just three years.\\n\\nIn all likelihood, the price of Ethereum will most likely be affected by the quantity of demand for Defi. How much can Defi grow and gain support?\\n\\nIf there is support, then Ethereum will grow bigger. The launch of Ethereum 2.0 will also have an impact. If Ethereum 2.0 succeeds and upgrades the current Ethereum successfully and as claimed, then the price of Ethereum has no reason not to increase.\\n\\nWhen the triple bottom is complete, and Ethereum takes out its former all-time high, it could reach prices of over $35,000 per ETH before the end of the year 2025\\n\\nP.S.

Smart contracts can perform automated \\u201cif/then\\u201d statements to a torrent-like network to supposedly perform unimaginable feats.\\n\\nPersonally, I can\\u2019t think of anything Solidity (Ethereum\\u2019s proprietary programming language) does that can\\u2019t be accomplished just as elegantly in a more widely used language like Java or C++. And there are only 21 million total unique wallets on the network, which shows just how slowly the network is growing.\\n\\nOf course that number is deceiving and doesn\\u2019t account for duplicates. Personally, I have probably a dozen Ethereum addresses. The active user count peaked at around 1.1 million back in 2018. It\\u2019s below one million in 2022.\\n\\nTo put that in perspective, Ethereum launched in 2015 And has a market cap around $300 billion in Jan 2022. It\\u2019s been in the market for 7 years, and that\\u2019s a long time for an online tech company.\\n\\nClubhouse launched in 2020 and crossed 10 million unique accounts created by the end of 2021. It was last valued at $4 billion. Discord launched the same year as Ethereum and has nearly 400 million registered accounts and about 150 million monthly active users. It\\u2019s a $15 billion company.\\n\\nNeither Clubhouse nor Discord is an entire ecosystem like Ethereum, although the latter is much closer. Both have actual revenue-generating business operations. So, how exactly is it that Ethereum has a 20x higher market cap with fewer active users?\\n\\nMuch if it is hype, and it\\u2019s important to understand the friction that keeps Ethereum from growing:\\n\\n1. Gas fees are stupid expensive. When it was at its peak price above $4,000 in November, I had friends paying $80-$200 in gas fees just to claim a $12 ENS domain and then again to reverse register it and yet another to claim the ENS airdrop. I don\\u2019t know a single rational human being who would pay $240-$600 in transaction fees for a $12 domain. Today, the ether price is half what it was three months ago, and it still costs the same $80+for gas. Anyone with .Eth in their Twitter name makes terrible financial decisions. Personally, I got a lifetime domain at Unstoppable Domains on Polygon for zero gas that has more functionality than ENS. Neither is registered with ICANN, so both services are risky.\\n2. The network is ridiculously slow. Quoting Visa\\u2019s 24k transactions per second (TPS)  [ https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/about-visa/documents/aboutvisafactsheet.pdf ]processing speed is one of the biggest lies in crypto. If Ethereum is meant as a blockchain used for a tech stack instead of a pure currency, then why don\\u2019t they compare it to Amazon Web Services\\u2019s (AWS) transaction speeds of 1 million TPS [ https://www.businessinsider.com/amazons-cloud-can-handle-1-million-transactions-per-second-2012-4?amp ]? Web2 services like Amazon and Netflix and Twitter all run on AWS, so Ethereum is competing with AWS, not Visa. It\\u2019s a web development ecosystem, not a currency.\\n3. Back to the .Eth names, they\\u2019re the most laughably insecure and non-private feature I\\u2019ve ever seen. Web3 is promoted as giving you more control over your data and privacy, but it\\u2019s scary how easily you can stalk somebody on Etherscan or OpenSea.\\n4. Speaking of AWS, Ethereum is touted as a replacement for cloud infrastructure (in which point 2 above already reveals the fallacy). Yet 70% of Ethereum nodes are on hosted cloud services, with a quarter of it relying on AWS specifically. OpenSea, Etherscan, and Metamask all rely on web2 cloud infrastructure. Even decentralized exchanges go down with AWS, as we saw in December 2021 [ https://www.vice.com/amp/en/article/wxdnxy/amazons-server-outage-took-down-a-decentralized-crypto-exchange ].\\n5. Don\\u2019t even get me started on how wallets and private keys and seed phrases are not in any way user friendly. If I lose my debit card or forget my password, both my traditional bank (actually a credit union, but you get the point) and my fintech service like PayPal can help me. They\\u2019ll reset my password and replace my card so I always have access to my money. But nobody can help you recover a seed phrase. This keeps consumer adoption low.\\n6. Solidity is complicated. Developers don\\u2019t want to learn a new programming language, and enterprises don\\u2019t want to pay someone else for something they can do in-house. This keeps enterprise adoption low.\\nFew of these problems are unique to Ethereum though. And I\\u2019ve been hearing the rumors of an alleged \\u201cEthereum killer\\u201d for five years now, nearly as long as the project has been around. None ever succeeded.\\n\\nFirst it was Cardano and NEO/GAS. These days it\\u2019s Solana and Avalanche.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s an old adage I attribute to Rick Flair but could\\u2019ve come from someone before him, \\u201cto be the man, you have to beat the man.\\u201d Ethereum is \\u201cthe man\\u201d in crypto circles, but it generates zero revenue off a tiny user base. It\\u2019s sad when even a forgotten trend like Clubhouse is outperforming Ethereum in a fraction of the time. It\\u2019s not exactly sitting in an iron throne.\\n\\nSolana touts a 50,000 TPS speed, and anyone with inside knowledge of blockchain knows that is a fallacy for two reasons. One is that TPS speeds are like thread counts in sheets or firmness measurements for a mattress. It\\u2019s all marketing fluff, and every company uses a different bar to measure what constitutes a \\u201ctransaction.\\u201d This means Solana\\u2019s TPS is being calculated different than Ethereum to pump up its numbers.\\n\\nThe second fallacy is the bar used for comparison. While it may look great compared to both Ethereum and Visa, nobody is hosting Web2 apps on Visa servers (and no popular app you actually use is hosted on Ethereum). 50,000 TPS is dwarfed by AWS 1 million TPS, so they cheated and still look pathetic compared to existing services.\\n\\nWith all that said, I would buy $ETH before $SOL. It may be slower, but five years after I started on this industry, it\\u2019s still the closest to a real infrastructure and developer ecosystem. It came the closest to providing a useable UX for the average person. You can\\u2019t stake $SOL or even a layer 2 like $MATIC on a popular exchange like Coinbase. They may have exponentially lower gas fees than Ethereum, but even fractions of a penny are exponentially more expensive than the absolutely nothing you pay in transaction fees to post on Facebook or send an email. It\\u2019s like saying I\\u2019ll charge you $1 million for entry into a free public park but then I give you a deal for only $100. Sure, $100 is less than the $1 million I was going to charge you, but both are more than the $0 it actually costs.\\n\\nI could go on an entire rant about the false crypto promises of web3, DeFI, the Metaverse, and blockchain. But this should be plenty enough to understand specifically why Ethereum and its supposed killers are overhyped marketing fluff with no business nor tech fundamentals in place."}, {"upvote": 4, "content": "Ethereum is certainly worth holding but Zilliqa is already a competitor and on the verge of being a major competitor to ETH.

Will it ever reach it again?\\n\\nI'll give you at least five reasons to be bullish on Ethereum now. So let's look through them all.\\n\\nReason #1\\n\\nEthereum 2.0 [ https://www.quora.com/What-happens-to-ETH-when-2-0-rolls-out-Are-they-one-in-the-same-Where-can-I-find-info/answer/Sir-X-9 ], rolling today on Dec 1, is arguably the hottest topic in the crypto-verse. The initial phase, designed to improve scalability and security, represents the first step in Ethereum's transition from the PoW consensus algorithm into the PoS network.\\n\\nThis event could positively impact ETH's price, if not push it to new all-time highs. The shift to PoS and a huge amount of ETH locked into the protocol may trigger a spike in demand resulting in a supply shock, subsequently impacting its price action.\\n\\nReason #2\\n\\nThe growing number of ETH long term holders indicates that potential stakers welcome this development.\\n\\nAccording to Intotheblock data [ https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1331266558228885512 ], the number of addresses holding Ethereum for more than one year has increased by 67% in a year. As the long term holding proposition continues to strengthen, it sets the pace for more holders and higher price of the smart contract token.\\n\\nAdditionally, the number of Ethereum whales, owning more than 10,000 ETH, has reached a 3-month high of 1,062, as Glassnode has revealed. It has also found that the number of addresses with a balance of more than zero ETH [ https://twitter.com/glassnodealerts/status/1332402739909898246 ] has reached a new all-time high of more than 50 million, meaning that more and more people are investing in it.\\n\\nReason #3\\n\\nAmong other factors that could be driving the Ethereum surge is a spike in Google searches that approaches the levels not seen since 2018.\\n\\nDoes the searching interest impact ETH price? Though there is no solid argument that explains the relationship between these two factors, in the past, an increase in the price has often aligned with an increase in Google searches and vice versa.\\n\\nReason #4\\n\\nThe Ether options put/call ratio, widely used by investors to gauge the overall market mood, has been skewing heavily towards calls over the past month.\\n\\nThe put/call ratio shows the number of puts, which are options bets to price downside, versus calls, which are options bets to price upside.\\n\\nReason #5\\n\\nUsually, the cryptocurrency landscape is livening up in the wake of bitcoin's push towards surpassing its all-time high. Analysts have repeatedly recorded that Bitcoin directly impacts the value of other cryptos, especially Ether, as the factors affecting the price are often interrelated.\\n\\nOf course, there are several theories [ https://www.quora.com/How-much-will-Bitcoin-rise-in-the-coming-months/answer/Sir-X-9 ] on how high Bitcoin may rise, but overall it is predicted bright prospects for the next 12 months and could help Ether to rise further.\\n\\nTo sum up\\n\\nIn five short years, Ethereum is fast developing into an altcoin with strength and decent investment qualities. It's a thrilling space to be invested in and a dramatic area of investment to watch. At the moment, there seems to be very little that can cast any bearish cloud in the long term prospects of Ethereum. With the growing demand for ETH from the DeFi sector and the blockchain's use on the rise, as well as more credible investors jumping aboard the crypto gravy train, the possibility of reaching a new ATH seems increasingly real.\\n\\nLooking for more price predictions on Ethereum?

But there are still some interesting projects that are gaining traction. Here are five cryptocurrencies that could be more attractive than Bitcoin & Ethereum in 2023.\\n\\nThe current cryptocurrency market is still in its infancy, and as the technology matures, we\\u2019ll likely see a number of new coins enter the market. For now, there are only a handful of cryptocurrencies that have been able to stand out from the crowd and gain traction with the public. While Bitcoin is by far the most well-known and widely used cryptocurrency, it has a number of limitations that prevent it from becoming a truly universal payment system.\\n\\nTerra Luna, Three Arrows Capital, and Celsius are just a few of the household names that have filed for bankruptcy due to the loss of their value. There have been massive lay-offs at top cryptocurrencies firms. Many people see this as a sign that another \\u201cCrypto Winter\\u201d will wipe out a large chunk of value from the market.\\n\\nBitcoin and Ethereum are two of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world today. These two currencies have a large user base and a wide array of uses, but many people wonder what the future holds for these two cryptocurrencies. The answer to this question is in the hands of the people who invest in these two currencies. For this reason, I decided to do a quick research and see which are the five cryptocurrencies that could be more attractive than Bitcoin & Ethereum in 2023.\\n\\nCardano (ADA)\\n\\nThe co-founding of the company was done by Charles Hoskinson, one of the original founders of the company. ADA is backed by cryptography experts, mathematicians, and engineers, and is seen to be one of the most sophisticated crypto projects. ADA\\u2019s goal is to develop the most sophisticated and research-based products in the space.\\n\\nPolkadot (DOT)\\n\\nDOT can perform unique transactions without needing a third party to mediation. The attractive value proposition is provided by the fact that developers can create their own blockchain using the ecosystem.\\n\\nMonero (XMR)\\n\\nXMR boasts of being private and secure. It\\u2019s not possible to be tracked using the system, like it\\u2019s not possible to be tracked using the system & it\\u2019s not possible to be tracked by third parties. XMR hides the identity of the parties involved in a transaction.\\n\\nSolana (SOL)\\n\\nSOL is created to support existing and future distributed applications in the space. It charges a far lower fee than ETH, making it more competitive and widely known.\\n\\nStellar (XLM)\\n\\nThe vision of the project is for all the world\\u2019s financial institutions to be able to run on the network, one of the most ambitious projects in the space. It is possible to trade all forms of traditional currency in a digital format. Providing a unique identity in the space is what this is about."}, {"upvote": 15, "content": "There are so many BS bitcoin derivatives and unsophisticated investors who are greedy to make money.

The \\u201cbest investment\\u201d can vary pending how we prioritize those 3 factors. I\\u2019ll do my best to walk you through my thinking on each of these.\\n\\nReturn - We all pretty much agree here, a high return is better than a low return.\\n\\nRisk - All else equal, we prefer lower risk to higher risk. That said, some people are willing to take on higher risk in order to obtain higher returns. Others would rather have more of a sure win, even if that win is a little smaller. We\\u2019ll look at both a low risk preference and a high risk preference.\\n\\nTime - The better short-term investment is not always the better long-term one. We\\u2019ll look at both cases.\\n\\nBut in one word the best investment Platform out there that fits in all category is multicoinhodler where you get double on Return on Investment on any of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoincash, Litecoin you ivest in after 7 days. its not like the other \\\"TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE\\\" investment platforms that ends up carting away with your cash. i have been with them for a while and its actually worth every bit of risk . just google multicoinhodler on how to go about it"}, {"upvote": 559, "content": "Which one is a better investment, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, or Ripple?"}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-that-one-day-Ethereum-will-be-more-valuable-than-Bitcoin", "question": "Do you think that one day Ethereum will be more valuable than Bitcoin", "answers": [{"upvote": 7, "content": "Ethereum has not been conceived as a currency, but as \\u201cfuel\\u201d for its network.\\n\\nAnd while the Bitcoin inflation is known and consistent, and will lead to a finite number of Bitcoins, Ethereum\\u2019s inflation is fixed at 2% per year forever (at the moment).\\n\\nSo the chances that Ethereum\\u2019s value will be higher, per unit, than Bitcoin\\u2019s value, are very very thin."}, {"upvote": 19, "content": "Based on their market cap, I don't think it unreasonable to see that change happen sometime in the next two years.\\n\\nEthereum has a lot of momentum and a lot of innovation that, regardless of its value today, will keep the market moving forward. Even if Bitcoin does not collapse and continues to grow, I believe Ethereum will grow faster.\\n\\nSoon, were not going to be talking about Bitcoin and Altcoins, but blockchains and cryptocurrencies, of which Bitcoin is just one of the players."}, {"upvote": 6, "content": "The world\\u2019s second most valuable cryptocurrency, ether, has been touching all-time highs in price ahead of a major upgrade of its underlying platform, ethereum. Ether is currently worth in aggregate just shy of $500 USD BILLION . That\\u2019s still slightly less than half that of the biggest cryptocurrency, bitcoin\\n\\nEther vs bitcoin by total value (market cap)\\n\\nEther works in a similar way to bitcoin. It is a word software application with no host, on which developers are building thousands of blockchain-based applications. This means these applications can all run without being controlled by a company. Examples include crypto systems, exchange sites and new kinds of gaming. With a lot to exploit from investing in both Ethereum and Bitcoins, I for a person often advise that investors investors their cryptocurrency in companies such as the CoinStore (www.coinstore.tech), where investors are able to get substantial returns on investments, maximizing their profits and an opportunity to compound profits without having to worry about volatility or price swings.\\n\\nWill Ethereum Coin overtake Bitcoin?\\n\\nYes, Ethereum at some point have huge tendency to take the mantle of leadership from Bitcoin due to its tech advantages over its rival. In few years to come, 5 to 10 years from now, I believe Ethereum will manifest in such ways that will make its over take bitcoins.The eventual creation of an ethereum 2.0 will solve these problems by moving the platform\\u2019s system of validation from \\u201cproof of work\\u201d to \\u201cproof of stake\\u201d. Without getting into too many detail , proof of work is a protocol in which validators all attempt to solve complex equations to prove that each proposed transaction is valid. With proof of stake, there\\u2019s no need for all validators to do this power-hungry work, because the system chooses one at random to confirm each transaction.\\n\\nEither way, Ethereum 2.0 promises to reduce the platform\\u2019s power consumption by 99.9%, making it far more sustainable. It should also solve the problem with gas fees by raising the platform\\u2019s processing ability from 30 transactions a second to potentially 100,000, as well as making possible more sophisticated smart contracts than before.\\n\\nEther is up by over 380% this year. In fact, it has outperformed all other benchmark assets in the first half of this year.The thing that hits me about ETH basically, Ether has a higher level of real-use potential as Ethereum, the platform on which it is the native cryptocurrency, is the most in-demand development platform for smart contracts, thereby highlighting that network's value not only as a platform for developers but as a worldwide financial utility\\n\\nSecond, investor enthusiasm for the game-changing transition to ETH 2.0, which makes the Ethereum network considerably more scalable, sustainable and secure. These upgrades represent a major boost not just for Ethereum but for blockchain technology itself.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nEthereum is more useful than Bitcoin and has tech advantages over its better-known rival.Ultimately, this will mean that its value will exceed that of Bitcoin - probably within five years."}, {"upvote": 8, "content": "I don't think so, but of course, I could be wrong, because I don't know what the future will be made of.\\n\\nMy feeling however is that Bitcoin is the future and what Bitcoin brings to the world is unparalleled.

(This figure is likely to be much higher in future as Bitcoin grows).\\n\\nPrevalance of high profile Scandals\\n\\nEthereum has already split once due to stolen coins and they have recently had a few more hacks where more than $37 million worth of coins were stolen.\\n\\nThis is certainly not the end of the hacks and there are no guarantees that they wont split again. By splitting the coin, the Ethereum community ended up rewarding both the hackers and the incompetent people that got hacked.\\n\\nBlockchain bloat.\\n\\nBecause Ethereum is trying to be the Swiss army knife of bock-chains the storage requirements for Ethereum are currently growing much faster than Bitcoin, this means that it will reach the practical limits of bandwidth and storage space sooner than Bitcoin. This is a classic Hare and the tortoise scenario.\\n\\nKarma\\n\\nEthereum has been really successful to-date because it built upon the technologies first pioneered by Bitcoin. There is absolutely nothing stopping another genius kid from creating better Ethereum in the future which could surpass both ETH and BTC. In theory the next Ethereum could suck the life out of the current Ethereum just as it tried to do to Bitcoin.\\n\\nSwitch to POS.\\n\\nAt some point ETH is likely to switch to POS, if this happens then it\\u2019s growth will inevitably slow because people will no longer be able to mine the coin. Less miners = less users. I am sure the ETH team are aware of this and that is why they are considering a hybrid PoW PoS system. If they don\\u2019t get the balance right then a switch to PoS may lead to centralization.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nDon\\u2019t get me wrong I believe Ethereum is here to stay but I don\\u2019t think its price growth will be anywhere near as exciting it has been in the past 2 years and I am currently not convinced that ETH will be able to beat BTC before the next new fan-dangled technology comes along."}, {"upvote": 2, "content": "Everything is possible but it won\\u2019t happen.\\n\\nBitcoin\\u2019s value does not directly come from its technological underpinnings or even usability. It is the first, iconic, organically distributed, limited and commands unparalleled mindshare. At the same time bitcoin is one of the slowest and highest fee attracting cryptocurrencies and will never act as a major general currency, perhaps it can be used as such after various layer 2 solutions etc. are further advanced, but it is still far too limited and expensive to serve this purpose accordingly. It can however serve as digital gold once its volatility comes down. Bitcoin is an \\u2018icon\\u2019 and piece of history that is largely safe from any technologically driven competition.\\n\\nEthereum on the other hand derives its value from being a blockchain platform as a service and of course second most popular crypto by mindshare. Its value is directly associated with its usability as a platform and its usage respectively, but this means it is not safe from competition. Meaning there is every chance a new blockchain based ecosystem/platform that outperforms Ethereum a hundred-fold could come a long (there are already some on the horizon) and that Ethereum would not be able to compete with on speed, function or price even after updates. Once this competitor amasses enough dApps and users, ethereum could fade into oblivion."}, {"upvote": 171, "content": "Do you think that one day Ethereum will be more valuable than Bitcoin?"}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/Where-can-I-buy-Ether-for-Ethereum", "question": "Where can I buy Ether for Ethereum", "answers": [{"upvote": 20, "content": "Update 21 March 2016 as this answer gets a ridiculous amount of views:\\n\\nEthereum is now for sale on most cryptocurrency exchanges.

As for Ether, this is just a shortened name for for Ethereum. The good news is, having some Ethereum in one's wallet is enough. Gas fees will pay themselves through the wallet. But you need to be aware of setting up the fee, so that it is not too high. Watch out for periods of congestion, when a low fee means your transaction will not be included in a block, and you will have to send it again, after losing the initial gas fee for the failed transaction.

You always need to be mindful that it\\u2019s price rises and falls compared to other currencies. One way bitcoins is different from traditional investments is that you either need to hold the coins yourself or trust a third party to do it. If you hold them yourself, there is the risk that you don\\u2019t store them properly and lose them. If you let a third party hold them for you, they may get hacked. And unlike storing dollars or stocks, once the coins are hacked, you need an expert to help you get your money back, check westextrail for help.\\n\\nIf someone robs a bank, the government will make the bank go through Federal deposit insurance corporation. There is no risk to you as the bank customer. But bitcoins is different. Bitcoins are limited in supply (only 21 million will ever exist). So it isn\\u2019t so easy to replace them, you can only recover them.\\n\\nFor one, bitcoin cannot be artificially inflated like a dollar. Bitcoin is deflationary, which means the coins become more valuable over time, not less. You can buy more with a bitcoin today than you could a year ago. So, while holding bitcoin has its own risks, so does holding dollars. It\\u2019s up to you to decide which one you trust more.\\n\\nThe difference between bitcoin and all other coins is enormous. Bitcoin has a market cap worth over $1 trillion. No altcoin comes even close to that. There is also no altcoin that is as old or established as bitcoin is.

Unlike the Bitcoin network which was designed for Bitcoin transactions only, Ethereum is a DIY platform for decentralized apps (or Dapps) that uses smart contracts. \\u2018Ether\\u2019 is Ethereum network\\u2019s currency and it is used for running Dapps.\\n\\nWhat is Ethereum? Ethereum was first proposed in late 2013 and then brought to life in 2014 by Vitalik Buterin who back at the time was the co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine. Ethereum is the Do It Yourself platform for decentralized programs also known as Dapps \\u2013 decentralized apps. If you want to create a decentralized program that no single person controls (not even you even though you wrote it), all you have to do is learn the Ethereum programming language called Solidity and begin coding. The Ethereum platform has thousands of independent computers running it meaning it\\u2019s fully decentralized. Once a program is deployed to the Ethereum network these computers, also known as nodes, will make sure it executes as written. Ethereum\\u2019s goal is to truly decentralize the Internet. Many people believe the Internet already is decentralized and that anyone can start their own site. While in theory that might be true, in practice Amazon, Google, Facebook, Netflix and other giants control most of the world wide web as we know it. There\\u2019s almost no activity on the web that happens without some sort of intermediary or 3rd party. But once the concept of digital decentralization was demonstrated by Bitcoin, a whole new array of opportunities became available. We can finally start to imagine and design an Internet that connects users directly without the need for centralized 3rd parties. People can \\u201crent\\u201d hard drive space directly to other people and make Dropbox obsolete. Drivers can offer their services directly to passengers and remove \\u201cUber\\u201d as the middleman. People can buy cryptocurrencies directly from one another without the need for an exchange that can get hacked or steal your money. Ethereum allows people to connect directly with each other without a central authority to take care of things. It\\u2019s a network of computers that together combine into one powerful, decentralized supercomputer. 3. How Ethereum Works \\u2013 Smart Contracts? Ok, So now you know what Ethereum does but we haven\\u2019t touched upon HOW it does it. Ethereum\\u2019s coding language, Solidity, is used to write \\u201cSmart Contracts\\u201d that are the logic that runs Dapps. Let me explain\\u2026 In real life, all a contract is, is a sets of \\u201cIfs\\u201d and \\u201cThens\\u201d. Meaning a set of conditions and actions. For example \\u2013 if I pay my landlord $1500 on the 1st of the month Then he lets me use my apartment. That\\u2019s exactly how smart contracts work on Ethereum. Ethereum developers write the conditions for their program or Dapp and then the Ethereum network executes it. They are called smart contracts because they deal with all of the aspects of the contract \\u2013 enforcement, management, performance, and payment. For example, if I have a smart contract that is used for paying rent, the landlord doesn\\u2019t need to actively collect the money from me. The contract itself \\u201cknows\\u201d if the money has been sent. If I indeed sent the money, then I will be able to open my apartment door. If I missed my payment, I will be locked out. However smart contracts also have their downsides. Going back to my previous example, instead of having to kick out a renter that isn\\u2019t paying, a \\u201csmart\\u201d contract would lock the non-paying renter out of their apartment. A truly intelligent contract on the other hand, would take into account other factors as well, such as extenuating circumstances, the spirit with which the contract was written and it would also be able to make exceptions if warranted. In other words, it would act like a really good judge. Instead, a \\u201csmart contract\\u201d in the context of Ethereum is not intelligent at all. It\\u2019s actually uncompromisingly letter strict. It follows the rules down to a T and can\\u2019t take any secondary considerations or the \\u201cspirit\\u201d of the law into account like what commonly happens with real world contracts. Once a smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum network, it can not be edited or corrected, even by its original author. It\\u2019s immutable. The only way to change a smart contract would be to convince the entire Ethereum network (i.e. all the computers participating around the world) that a change should be made and that\\u2019s virtually impossible. This creates a very serious problem since unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum was built with the ability to create really complex contracts, and complex contracts are very difficult to secure. With any contract, the more complicated it is, the harder it is to enforce as more room is left for interpretations, or more clauses must be written to deal with contingencies. With smart contracts, security means handling with perfect accuracy every possible way in which a contract could be executed in order to make sure that the contract does only what the author intended. Ethereum launched with the idea that \\u201ccode is law\\u201d. That is, a contract on Ethereum is the ultimate authority and nobody could overrule the contract. This all came to a crashing halt when the DAO event happened. The DAO \\u2013 When smart contracts go wrong The DAO stands for \\u201cDecentralized Autonomous Organization\\u201d which allowed users to deposit money and get returns based on the investments that the DAO made. The decisions themselves would be crowd-sourced and decentralized. The DAO raised $150M in Ethereum currency ,ether. when Ether was trading at around $20. While this all sounded very good, the code wasn\\u2019t secured very well and resulted in someone figuring out a way to drain the DAO out of money. Now you could say that the person who drained the DAO was a \\u201chacker\\u201d. But some would argue that this was just someone that was taking advantage of the loopholes he found in the DAO\\u2019s smart contract. This isn\\u2019t very different than a creative lawyer figuring out a loophole in the current law to effect a positive result for his client. What happened next is that the Ethereum community decided that code no longer is law and changed the Ethereum rules in order to revert all the money that went into the DAO. In other words, the contract writers and investors did something stupid and the Ethereum developers decided to bail them out. The small minority that didn\\u2019t agree with this move stuck to the original Ethereum Blockchain before its protocol was altered and that\\u2019s how Ethereum Classic was born (which is actually the original Ethereum). 4. Ether \\u2013 Ethereum\\u2019s currency We\\u2019ve covered a lot up until now and the last thing I want to talk about is Ethereum as a currency. We\\u2019ve already established that Ethereum is basically a large bunch of computers working together like one super computer to execute code that powers Dapps. However this costs money \\u2013 Money to get the machines, to power them up, store them and cool them if needed. That\\u2019s why Ether was invented. When people talk about the price of Ethereum they actually are referring to Ether \\u2013 the currency that incentivizes people to run the Ethereum protocol on their computer. This is very similar to the way Bitcoin miners get paid for maintaining the Bitcoin blockchain. In order to deploy a smart contract to the Ethereum platform, its author must pay to do so. That payment is made in the form of ether. This is done so that people will write optimized and efficient code and won\\u2019t waste the Ethereum network computing power on unnecessary tasks. Ether was first distributed in Ethereum\\u2019s original Initial Coin Offering back in 2014. Back then it cost around 40 cents to buy one Ether. Today, one Ether is valued in hundreds of dollars since the use of the Ethereum network has grown immensely due to the ICO hype that started in 2017. 5. Frequently Asked Questions Is Ethereum a Currency? Ethereum is the infrastructure for running Dapps worldwide. It\\u2019s not a currency, it\\u2019s a platform. The currency used to incentivize the network is called Ether. How Much is Ethereum Worth Right Now? At the moment 1 Ether ~ 259 USD What\\u2019s the Difference Between Bitcoin and Ethereum? The one major difference Bitcoin and Ethereum is that Bitcoin is used as an application for decentralizing money while Ethereum is used to run Smart Contracts and decentrazlied basically everything. Comparing Bitcoin to Ethereum would be like comparing apples to oranges since they don\\u2019t fulfill the same purpose. Having said that here are the main differences between their small similarities (since they\\u2019re both cryptocurrencies). Total supply of coins \\u2013 Bitcoin has a total supply of 21m while Ether isn\\u2019t limited in its supply. Hashing Algorithm \\u2013 Bitcoin uses that Sha256 algorithm while Ethereum uses Scrypt. Avg. Block Confirmation Time \\u2013 Bitcoin has a block time of 10 minutes while Ethereum\\u2019s is 15 seconds. Mining Hardware \\u2013 Bitcoin is mined with ASICs while Ethereum is mined with GPUs. Initial Coin Distribution \\u2013 Bitcoin was always based on mining while Ethereum conducted an ICO.\\n\\nHow is Ethereum Created? Ether is created through the process of mining, just like in Bitcoin. This means that computers around the world compete for solving a mathematical problem. The first computer to solve the problem gets to mine the next block of Ethereum transactions. In return he is awarded 2 new Ether by the network. You can read more about Ethereum mining here. 6.

Well, that someday may be sooner than we expect. Although they're the two biggest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Bitcoin and Ethereum are totally different animals, developed for different reasons and with different internal dynamics.\\n\\nHere's a quick rundown of some of the biggest considerations regarding the outlook for each cryptocurrency as well as if ETH will beat BTC someday.\\n\\nBitcoin\\n\\n1. It has the highest attention from large investors. The Winklevoss twins, prominent Harvard grads who say Mark Zuckerberg stole their idea for Facebook Inc. (FB), notably tried to launch a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, but the US Securities and Exchange Commission rejected them.\\n\\nIn the investing community, cryptocurrency is becoming more broadly acknowledged. Individual and institutional investors alike are becoming interested in crypto assets. The SEC recently permitted the first Bitcoin futures ETFs to trade, indicating that interest is only going to grow.\\n\\n2. It is relatively stable, simple, and accepted. A decentralized currency, independent of the Federal Reserve or any other central bank, with a predetermined maximum supply, is an appealing concept that people all around the world can understand.\\n\\nIn the case of Bitcoin, the market's high regard for the notion has been rigorously tested and confirmed over time.\\n\\n3. There is a finite amount available. Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist. The cryptocurrency's known global supply limit is one of the main reasons why some speculators compare it to digital gold.\\n\\nHowever, unlike gold, new reserves cannot be discovered, and approximately 90% of bitcoins, or 18.6 million, have already been mined.\\n\\nThe rate at which a new BTC is created slows over time due to a mechanism known as bitcoin halving, which halves the rate of bitcoin generation every 210,000 block transactions. The previous bitcoin halving occurred in May 2020; if present trends continue, the next halving will occur in 2024.\\n\\n\\n%3E [math]Bitcoin  [/math]currently has the most institutional interest because of its inherent value. Top CEOs of tech companies have BTC in their portfolio as well.\\n\\nBut\\u2026\\n\\nBitcoin is not optimizing for long-term predictability, which could mean the largest network has to change something; Maybe move to PoS, Ethereum network, or maybe even remove the 21 million limit.\\nEthereum\\n\\nEthereum is a little bit different from Bitcoin. Although BTC\\u2019S dominance remains high, it currently only offers a store of value whereas with Ethereum, it takes you into a whole new world of DeFi, dApps, NFT\\u2019S and Metaverse.\\n\\n\\n%3E Just so much upside potential compared to Bitcoin\\u2026\\nEthereum also has a burning mechanism like Shiba Inu which burns tokens and taking it out of supply, making it even more valuable than Bitcoin in the long run.\\n\\nEconomic security on Ethereum is much much higher than bitcoin, and that contributes to (its) ultra-soundness.\\n\\nUltraSound Money\\n\\nETH is ultrasound money and differentiates itself from numerous blockchains and cryptocurrencies.\\n\\n * It is going through a supply shock\\n * ETH is regularly burned to decrease supply in circulation, making it more valuable than Bitcoin in the long run.\\n * Hardened monetary policy.\\nEthereum is going in one single direction of hardening, so it can maximize long-term predictability.\\n\\nScaling Solutions\\n\\nEthereum is busy migrating from ETH 1.0 (Proof of Work) to ETH 2.0 (Proof of Stake). which will handle far more transactions p/s. compared to ETH 1.0. which only handles about 20 transactions p/s whereas ETH 2.0 will make it possible for over 100 000 transactions p/s.\\n\\nImportant players in the Layer 2 scaling solution are Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum. (Thanks to them).\\n\\n\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014-\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIt\\u2019s obvious that Ethereum is leaving Bitcoin for dust with all its advantages. So it is possible that ETH can beat BTC. Looking at all the DeFi and Metaverse projects, the majority of them are built on the Ethereum blockchain.\\n\\nAnd being a HODLER of ETH, I can clearly see that the price of ethereum could go past the $5,000 mark by the end of 2021 and rocket to over $35,000 by the end of 2022.\\n\\nIf you want to know more about Ethereum and its future potential, feel free to follow or check out my BIO.\\n\\nDisclaimer:\\n\\nDisclaimer: The opinion expressed here is not investment advice \\u2013 it is provided for informational purposes only.

It is the first decentralized digital currency, as the system works without a central bank or single administrator. The currency is stored in an encrypted digital wallet that can either be accessed on any device. Each of the Bitcoin transactions between different wallets is monitored by a network called bitcoin miners.\\n\\nEthereum- Ethereum is a decentralized, public blockchain that has no centralized point of control. It provides low-cost transactions and eliminates the need for any third party to process the transaction and enforce agreements between parties. It enables smart contracts and Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAO) to be built without any centralized control.\\n\\nMajor Difference Between Bitcoins Vs Ethers\\n\\n * Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that was created to challenge the global fiat money system and essentially become an alternative to national currencies and help facilitate transactions. Ethereum, on the other hand, was created as a platform that allows people to execute smart contracts and build immutable applications.\\n * While the Bitcoin and Ethereum cryptocurrencies are both based on distributed ledgers, they are technically different in many ways. For example, transactions on the Ethereum network support executing some code, while data affixed to Bitcoin transactions is generally only for keeping notes.\\n * Other differences between the two include confirmation times (an ether transaction takes seconds to confirm compared to minutes for bitcoin) and algorithms (Ethereum uses ethash while Bitcoin uses SHA-256).\\n * Like Bitcoin, Ethereum is a digital currency.

It was made to ease the process of the digital financial payment system.

It\\u2019s a platform where people can be built and publish their distributed apps like we make an android app and put it on Google Play Store.\\n\\nDeveloper\\u2019s Perspective:\\n\\nBoth are open source projects. But, to build a new token personally, I will always choose Ethereum over Bitcoin.\\n\\nEthereum has EVM [ https://medium.com/crypt-bytes-tech/wtf-is-evm-cefca164c1af ] whereas Bitcoin doesn\\u2019t have VM concept. This is one of the reasons why many new tokens are built on the top of Ethereum. Ethereum has its own unit called as Ether. Ether is not to establish itself as a payment alternative (unlike Bitcoin) but to facilitate the smooth running and working of Ethereum to enable developers to build and run distributed applications (\\u0110Apps). Another reason is DAO which was made as the digital decentralized autonomous organization as an investor-directed venture capital fund. Because of these reasons, more then 800 tokens are being launched on ETH platform since 2015. And, because of phishing attach vectors more then $115 has been lost.\\n\\nTransaction time in Bitcoin is usually of 10 mins whereas for Ethereum takes around 20 secs.\\n\\nBitcoin uses stack-based programming language whereas ETH smart contract is built on solidity. It\\u2019s very hard to code feature outside of framework in the stack-based programming language.\\n\\nScript language in Bitcoin has not been exposed because of conservative nature of Bitcoin core. They believe Bitcoin as a financial network and developer platform like Ethereum.\\n\\nFinancial Perspective:\\n\\nThe market cap of BTC is way too high against ETH. BTC is there in the market for the longer duration and survived every time when the market was against it whereas, ETH is still in nascent stage and it has the long way to go.\\n\\nDisclaimer: All contents presented here are research-based and for educational purpose.

Using Authorship as an example, you can buy into the new offering prior to them going public, by donating a single Ethereum to the address that Authorship provides. For this Ethereum which will cost you abou $300US, Authorship provides you with (depends how much they raise), say 11,000 Authorship tokens/coins, which will have an initial value of US 15 cents. So you could sell those tokens and buy about 4.5 Ethereum, giving you an instant profit of 3.5 ethereum. Or you could hold the tokens, because Authorship has a good team and a good plan, so the price will very likely rise to far above its initial 15 cents, given time.\\n\\nSo that\\u2019s a typical example of how most Ethereum coins are currently being used\\u2026 to make profit by shrewd Eth investment.

But what we are going to discuss today is the future of Ethereum.\\n\\nWhat is Ethereum?\\n\\nLaunched in 2013, Ethereum was released a comparatively long time after Bitcoin and a few other competitors. But it rose past all the competition in a short amount of time to emerge as one of the top three cryptocurrencies in the world. It was created by Vitalik Buterin.\\n\\nWhat makes Ethereum successful?\\n\\nTo predict the future of Ethereum, we first need to understand what made it reach the position it is in right now.\\n\\nEthereum is a decentralized, open-source, and distributed computing platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications, also known as dApps. It uses smart contracts to run the network. Smart contracts are applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party interference.\\n\\nIn the future, traditional contracts may become outdated for the purposes of certain transactions only. Rather than drafting a costly, lengthy contract employing attorneys, banks, notaries, etc. contracts could be created with a few lines of code. Smart contracts could potentially be constructed automatically by connecting together a handful of human-readable clauses. So, Ethereum is already leading in this. This unique approach has contributed significantly to the growth of Ethereum.\\n\\nAlong with this, Ethereum also has adoption support from big business companies.\\n\\nEthereum reached an all-time high of $1,432.88 on January 13, 2018. While price itself is not a useful metric, since the circulating supply dictates the total market capitalization of a coin, Ethereum is still one of the few cryptocurrencies to reach these values.\\n\\nPredictions\\n\\nEthereum can reach great heights. It has the capacity to reach the level of Bitcoin in a few years. It can also almost certainly show continuous growth in value and market capitalization in the coming years. Moreover, it will continue to be a trustworthy cryptocurrency and a leader in the business. If you\\u2019re looking to trade Ethereum - head over to WazirX, a fairly large and low-cost cryptocurrency exchange."}, {"upvote": 161, "content": "Can you give some predictions about Ethereum?"}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-of-Ethereum-over-Bitcoin", "question": "What are the advantages of Ethereum over Bitcoin", "answers": [{"upvote": 33, "content": "You need a lot of money to invest in one of it.

Ethereum is gaining recognition as a useful for its Smart Contracts.\\n\\nYou are right. Investing in Ethereum is better and is more stable than BTC."}, {"upvote": 291, "content": "In 2009, Bitcoin was introduced and not many people knew about it. Over time, when people learned about the decentralization from fiat money, they learned they can be more free. No more worrying about your money being frozen from big banks and intermediaries like PayPal. You are your bank now. However, Bitcoin got much bigger than most people thought and it did that very fast. With its increase in price so quickly, it has suffered an increase in transaction fees and also a slowdown in its transaction speed. However, it is still useful. When Ethereum came out, it was looked down upon because the market hadn\\u2019t matured yet. No one understood much about cryptos beyond the peer to peer transfer. When the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum was established, that is when we had a surge of the altcoin rush. This caused prices to skyrocket on all altcoins. It seems as if the roles have been reversed and there is more doubt on Bitcoin than anything else. This is why we recommend you hodl Ethereum over Bitcoin.\\n\\nBefore i continue, let me introduce you to a platform i discovered where you can sell your Bitcoin and other top Cryptocurrencies at the exact rate in dollars any where in the world. The website is IBUYCRYPTO (www.ibuycrypto.store). It is safe and secure. The interesting part of it is that, you don\\u2019t have to drop your vital informations before you sell to them. You sell and get your money directly sent to your bank account immediately your deposit is confirmed. You can also sell and request the money is sent to someone else. Thank me later after using this platform.\\n\\nWhat is Bitcoin Used for?\\n\\nWith Bitcoins increase in price, it has been dubbed as gold 2.0 because of its store of value like feature. It is the most expensive cryptocurrency and it actually has the highest market cap. Bitcoin has also been the most resilient. It has the ability to drive the market up or down. If people start taking money out of Bitcoin, expect the whole market to come down. The vice versa also happens. With Bitcoins recently mempool always being full along with the transactions being so expensive, people are looking for other routes. There are upgrades that are expected to fix this but it doesn\\u2019t seem like it will be here anytime soon. This is called Lightning Networking and it will have an effect on many other cryptocurrencies too.\\n\\nWhat is Ethereum Used for?\\n\\nEthereum was created by Vitalik Buterin and released in 2015. It is an open source public blockchain that lets people build on the blockchain. It can also be used a digital currency which it is at times. For example, if you decide to create an ICO with your own tokens, you will want people to buy your tokens somehow. You are thinking with a credit card but in cryptocurrencies, ICO\\u2019s are traded and paired with Ether usually. This means 1 eth is equal to a certain amount of your tokens. You must send your eth to a specific ICO address and receive your tokens that way. This is becoming bigger and bigger as more companies are looking to raise capital through the crypto markets rather than venture capital.\\n\\nWhy Ethereum will do better in the long term?\\n\\nThe future of ethereum contains a lot more hopes than Bitcoin does. Creating another Bitcoin is much easier than it is creating an ethereum that is running efficiently. We have many other coins that are working better as a peer to peer transfer of digital currencies like Litecoin and Vertcoin. We have been seeing Bitcoins dominance in market cap dropping down and with Ethereums market cap going up. The new Weiss Ratings increased confidence in Eth also.\\n\\n * More use cases: Ethereum has many more use cases than Bitcoin does. Not only can you use it as a peer to peer transfer but you can also use it to create your own ICO. It is even used to put data onto the blockchain.\\n * Platform for ICO\\u2019s: You cannot just create your own cryptocurrency and expect it to run efficiently. This is especially true if you\\u2019re looking to do specific with your cryptocurrency than what is already being done. Cryptocurrencies with open source codes can be coped and started by another company but having the ability to have it on a platform that is already one of the best is hard.\\n * Mining to Staking: Ethereum has said they will be looking to move over from mining to staking as it is much more efficient and secure. Mining is the use of specific hardware that is used to confirm transactions on the blockchain. Staking also confirms transactions however it is done keeping your tokens or coins in your wallet.\\n"}, {"upvote": 15, "content": "I think it's wrong to compare Ethereum and Bitcoin on the same scale , as they are targeted at different applications.

This gives it a great edge as a development platform, but also significantly increases attack surface. Satoshi Nakamoto, the elusive inventor of Bitcoin, made a conscious decision to limit Bitcoin scripting language as a security trade off. It's a feature, not a bug.

Ethereum has its own Turing complete internal code... a Turing-complete code means that given enough computing power and enough time... anything can be calculated. With Bitcoin, there is not this form of flexibility.\\n\\n5. Ethereum was crowd funded whilst Bitcoin was released and early miners own most of the coins that will ever be mined. With Ethereum 50% of the coins will be owned by miners in year five [ https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/how-do-currency-ether-units-get-issued-in-ethereum/ ].\\n\\n6.

The opinions expressed in this article are the personal opinions of the author at the time of publication.\\n\\n\\nHow High Will Ethereum Go?\\n\\nEthereum definitely has a huge potential to go beyond Bitcoin in terms of their market cap. The number of transaction on the Ethereum blockchain has spiked since the announcement on the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) that connects Fortune 500 enterprises, startups, academics, and technology vendors with Ethereum subject matter experts.\\n\\nInstitutions like Microsoft and JPMorgan have pledged their support to the development of Ethereum through the formation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. The purpose of the alliance is to ensure the potential of Ethereum is realized across industries.\\n\\nThe formation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) in February helped spark Ethereum\\u2019s parabolic rise. The 116 EEA members include such giants as Toyota Motor Corp. (NYSE ADR: TM), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), and Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC).\\n\\nAlthough many organizations are invested in leveraging Ethereum to serve as a basis for privatized versions, the overarching goal is that one day, each institution\\u2019s private networks will be connected to the global Ethereum blockchain. This will establish a new universal benchmark for information transactions.\\n\\nWhile the general public is just becoming aware of Ethereum, it already also has the backing of major global corporations.\\n\\nThe recent surge of Ethereum price has a few reasons behind.\\n\\n#1 Availability to buy ETH from Exchanges. Exchanges have gotten easier to use and safer. Just a year ago, in order to invest in any altcoins, you first had to buy BTC, then go to an exchange like Poloniex. Now, you can buy ETH directly from Coinbase, and then use Shapeshift or Changelly to move into another currency without an account.\\n\\nAs per today, we have a few major exchanges that people can buy Ethereum directly without going through the process of exchanging BTC for ETH. Now that users can directly convert their fiat currency into ether using familiar platforms, the price is increasing as that demand is being realized.\\n\\n * Huobi (top 3 Chinese exchange)\\n * Okcoin (largest Chinese exchange)\\n * Bithumb (largest Korean exchange)\\n * Korbit (#2 exchange in Korea)\\n * Coinbase/GDAX\\n * Bitstamp\\n * Coinhako\\n * eToro\\nExchanges above now let you turn dollars, CNY, and euros into BTC and ETH.

None has been more controversial in recent years than the debates about which cryptocurrency and blockchain pair will soon overtake the rest. Bitcoin, which has sat atop the market capitalization charts since the beginning of the crypto wave, has been the obvious majority alternative.\\n\\nHowever, most analysts do not believe this can continue. The Bitcoin blockchain, as the forefather of all cryptocurrencies, is showing its era. It has a number of real-world flaws, the most serious of which is its failure to scale. A number of alternative blockchain solutions have risen up to address some of the inherent issues associated with Bitcoin's blockchain in the fight for supremacy, but none have managed to win any substantial share of the business thus far.\\n\\nThe one notable exception is Ethereum, which has long been the lone, large-scale competitor to Bitcoin. For its part, though more advanced than Bitcoin, Ethereum also suffers from some issues that it would need to overcome to achieve market dominance. That\\u2019s exactly what the developers behind Ethereum hope to accomplish with their upcoming upgrade of the underlying blockchain, which they\\u2019re calling Ethereum 2.0. Here\\u2019s an overview of some changes that will come with the upgrade.\\n\\nAbandoning Proof-Of-Work\\n\\nThe fact that early blockchain applications (including Bitcoin and Ethereum) depend on a processing-power-intensive method known as proof of work to verify and log transactions was one of the explanations for performance problems. Participating computer nodes collaborate to produce cryptographic hashes that meet a network-determined degree of sophistication in such a scheme. To ensure stability, the difficulty level is maintained high enough to prevent anyone from attacking the network because operating the necessary hardware will be prohibitively expensive.\\n\\nThe problem with proof of work is that it\\u2019s terribly inefficient, and that\\u2019s by design. To begin solving that problem, Ethereum 2.0 is going to transition its blockchain to a more efficient, proof-of-stake system. In such a system, the node that records each transaction is chosen by an algorithm, with chances of selection increasing with the amount of the currency the node\\u2019s owner holds. That makes it possible to dramatically decrease the complexity of the cryptographic work, leading to massive throughput gains for the whole network. As each node must stake its own currency to participate, it would remain prohibitively expensive for anyone to attack the network.\\n\\nIntroducing Sharding\\n\\nIn another bid to improve Ethereum\\u2019s efficiency and ability to scale, the coming changes will also introduce a processing technique known as sharding. In the current blockchain version, all data that is added to the chain has to undergo verification by all participating nodes. That means that the processing speed of the entire system is limited by the speed of its slowest participant. It creates a bottleneck that increases transaction costs and decreases throughput.\\n\\nEthereum 2.0 will greatly improve the quality of its resource consumption by incorporating sharding into the mix. The new system achieves this by dividing data verification tasks among groups of nodes, each of which is responsible for only verifying the data it receives. This requires the entire blockchain to use parallel computing, potentially increasing total capability by many orders of magnitude. The modern Ethereum blockchain could be much quicker and more effective than its predecessor thanks to this new technology and the move to proof-of-stake.\\n\\neWASM to Replace EVM\\n\\nOne of the features that have made Ethereum such a viable platform and a worthy challenger to Bitcoin\\u2019s dominance is its implementation of what\\u2019s known as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The EVM is an execution environment that runs on all network nodes that facilitates the use of smart contracts. It\\u2019s those smart contracts that make Ethereum\\u2019s blockchain a global computational device, rather than a mere financial system. Smart contracts on the EVM can run games, execute complex financial transactions, or even operate social networks.\\n\\nDespite the fact that EVM is commonly used, it remains a mystery \\u2013 even to programmers with advanced skills. To fix this, Ethereum 2.0 will implement a framework known as eWASM, which will use network assembly language. This will allow Ethereum app code to be executed directly in today's web browsers, which would be a significant improvement over the EVM. It would also allow programmers to write code for the blockchain in a variety of languages, including Rust, C, and C++. eWASM would expand the number of possible programmers for the ecosystem in one fell swoop by removing the requirement for users to master a native Ethereum-only language.\\n\\nA New Day Dawns for Ethereum\\n\\nAs of the time of this writing, Ethereum\\u2019s developers expect their new changes to take place since it went live in the first quarter of 2020. The process won\\u2019t be quick, however. The upgrades will be put in place in three separate stages, to take place over a period of at least three years. The technical details of the stages are complex, but the basics are as follows:\\n\\n * Stage 1 \\u2013 Beacon chain launch, which runs a simplified proof of stake blockchain in parallel with the existing system. This is to facilitate the transition between the two types of validation concepts.\\n * Stage 2 \\u2013 The introduction of sharding. The blockchain will see its first divisions of processing, enabling parallel transaction validation for the first time.\\n * Stage 3 \\u2013 The launch of eWASM as the successor of EVM.\\nThe developers plan to test the device thoroughly at each level to ensure that it is both safe and stable. This would also give users time to adapt to the current blockchain implementation's nuances.\\n\\nAssuming that all of the stages go well, the latest Ethereum 2.0 should emerge from the process in a strong position to eventually put an end to Bitcoin's long reign as the king of cryptocurrencies. It would be a reliable machine with far less scalability challenges and a far more comprehensive feature set than its main rivals. Only time will say if the upgrade's release heralds the start of a new blockchain phase, but one thing is certain: Ethereum \\u2013 and the blockchain in general \\u2013 is entering a new age - and for the cryptocurrency space as a whole."}, {"upvote": 7, "content": "Basically, as far as my understanding goes, and in light of the upcoming ETH 2.0 launch, the response I'll provide to this question will be some information that every enthusiast should be aware of, as well as those who lost out on bitcoin in its early phases and don't want to lose out on this. Within the technological community, it's not uncommon to see passionate debate on a variety of topics. The disputes about which cryptocurrency and blockchain combo would soon eclipse the rest have been the most contentious in recent years. The clear majority alternative has been Bitcoin, which has been atop the market capitalization charts from the start of the crypto revolution.\\n\\nWe can believe in the future of ETH and SportsCollective as well.

In here, you can write your code with no restrictions & limits.\\n\\nQ: So we can write application programs in Ethereum. Is this kind of an application platform for blockchain?\\n\\nWell, according to the explanation; yes it is.\\n\\nQ: In summary you write a computer program (code) and send it to blockchain, and on every node (pc) it will run. So what does this give us?\\n\\nIt gives us the opportunity to automatize processes. You can write a code which will be run when previously determined events occur. In Ethereum, you can write code without any limit, so you can automatize any process if you can write its code. When you do it, you will have a smart contract. Congratulations!\\n\\nQ: Do I need blockchain to write smart contracts? I automatize many processes for years, I believe my current codes are enough smart, too. Even I can automatize a process using API\\u2019s between different firms. What\\u2019s extra of Ethereum?\\n\\nIn our current technology, each company has its own database and codebase. By smart contract on blockchain, we will have opportunity to run the same code on every node. It means that if we use shared code, it will be built, tested and deployed once. Then it will be used by all companies/people. Smart contracts economic impact can be huge. Today similar codes are being run and maintained by companies separately. Outputs of these codes can vary, and this will be a problem/cost in reconciliation process. All these costs will be minimized when common smart contracts are used.\\n\\nAlso today, there is some uncertainty in the meaning of contacts. We have law departments that clarify the meaning of contacts, because words can be interpreted differently. If we write smart contracts, there will be no more ambiguity. Computers will interpret these contracts, and all of them will understand the same thing.\\n\\nToday we have a cloud technology, we trust vendors to hold our data and applications. But with Ethereum blockchain; we don\\u2019t have to trust anyone to run our programs. It will be a trustless system; all data and applications will be stored and run on the entire world. Perhaps cloud technology is coming to an end. Or \\u201ccloud technology\\u201d will be transformed to \\u201cnodes in cloud for blockchain\\u201d.\\n\\nBeFit Smart Contract Use Case\\n\\nFor example we want to create a smart contract named \\u201cBeFit!\\u201d. This is a contract that makes you run :) Assume that each participant\\u2019s smart watch matched with their account in Ethereum. At the end of week, \\u201cBeFit\\u201d smart contract will be executed. If we run a distance below the average of all participants, we will lose money. But if it is higher than the average, we will earn money. The amount of money will be calculated according to your ranking. How near you are to the top of the list, earn more; how near to the bottom, you will lose more. By that way, participants will be able to monitor their current order in the race and the amount of earned or lost money.\\n\\nDo we really need a blockchain for that?\\n\\nThis is an inevitable question, \\u201ccouldn't we do such a design/application in current technology?\\u201d What is the difference between blockchain and traditional solutions?\\n\\nToday, BeFit can be done with using similar apps in an app/play store. But in today's solutions, how will we be sure that we are not cheated? Are these apps or companies being audited for the records and calculations? How can we sure that results are not altered?

worth in 2030", "answers": [{"upvote": 9, "content": "What will happen to Ethereum in the future?\\n\\nEthereum has been hard forking and updating many times so far, but what are your plans for the future?\\n\\nSince its announcement, Ethereum has undergone major updates over the years.\\n\\nIn 2021, the upgrade is finally in its final stages.\\n\\nI'm going to talk about how this upgrade will affect Ethereum's future and if there are other predictors of Ethereum's future.Ethereum will be a major updateThe Ethereum update plan is called a roadmap .\\n\\nThe roadmap can be broadly divided into four stages, and the final stage, Serenity, was implemented in December 2020.\\n\\nEthereum 2.0, called Serenity, is further divided into four phases, and the whole process is a little further away.\\n\\nThe maximum of the goal to aim at this time of the update, that the mining method is changed to PoS and, that is the implementation of sharding is.\\n\\nPoS\\n\\nPoS is an acronym for Proof of Stake and is one of the consensus algorithms.\\n\\nUntil now, Ethereum's consensus algorithm was PoW, but we plan to move to PoS in the end.\\n\\nPoS gives the person who holds a lot of coins the right to vote by majority and records the transaction.\\n\\nUnlike PoW, which is open to everyone, PoS can only participate in work if you have a lot of coins, which can save you a lot of power.\\n\\nThe specific advantage of Ethereum's transition to PoS is that the amount of new issuance due to Ethereum mining will be reduced.\\n\\nEventually, the number of new Ethereum issues will be reduced to zero.\\n\\nIf there are no new issues, the motivation for mining will decrease, which has the advantage of further reducing electricity costs.\\n\\nIn addition to this, 51% attack there is also merit in that it is resistant to.\\n\\nPoW is certainly a democratic system at first glance, but it has the disadvantage of being able to attack 51% if it is oligopolized by a large mining group.\\n\\nOn the other hand, in the case of PoS, it is said that it is impossible to launch a 51% attack because you have to hold a large amount of coins, no matter how much money you have.\\n\\nBest of all, if you have enough coins to make a 51% attack and then launch a 51% attack, you will definitely lose credibility and the coins will plunge the price.\\n\\nAt that time, the one who loses a lot is the person who launched the 51% attack, which has a large amount of coins.\\n\\nDue to this structural mechanism, PoS is said to be 51% resistant to attacks.\\n\\nIn addition to PoS, the block approval process is simple and the generation time is shortened, which also helps to significantly reduce the maintenance cost of the network.\\n\\nThere are many benefits to moving to PoS so that it is environmentally friendly, 51% attack resistant, and cost effective.\\n\\nImplementation of sharding\\n\\nSharding is a technology that divides the work of generating blocks on the blockchain and improves the efficiency of transaction verification work.\\n\\nImplementing this sharding can eliminate delays in verification work caused by excessive Ethereum users and trading volumes.\\n\\nThis delay in verification work is called a scalability problem and is one of Ethereum's challenges.\\n\\nThe implementation of sharding will speed up Ethereum transactions and improve the convenience of the entire application .\\n\\nExpansion and impact of the DeFi market\\n\\nDeFi is a system that incorporates financial institutions on the Ethereum blockchain [ https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development ] .\\n\\nAlso known as a decentralized financial institution, it is a general term for financial services that do not have a central administrator.\\n\\nUntil now, digital payments have been mediated by card companies and financial institutions to record, approve, and manage transaction history.\\n\\nHowever, by building this process on the Ethereum blockchain, there is no need to mediate between transactions.\\n\\nThis expansion of the DeFi market will reduce fees and allow people who could not hold a bank account to receive financial services, which will contribute to the further development of Ethereum.\\n\\nAlso listed on ETF (Exchange Traded Fund)\\n\\nOn February 25, 2021, a Canadian asset manager submitted an Ethereum ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) prospectus to regulators.\\n\\nIf approved, Ethereum's ETF will be the first in the world.\\n\\nOnce approved by the ETF, you will be able to invest in Ethereum through the ETF without having to own the Ethereum in kind.\\n\\nListing on an ETF also means that Ethereum will be officially recognized as a financial product, which will increase the credibility of Ethereum.\\n\\nWe can expect an inflow of funds from investors who have previously had low credit for cryptocurrencies.\\n\\nWhat will happen to the price of Ethereum in the future?\\n\\nEthereum is a virtual currency that is attracting attention from all over the world, such as being described as a computer in the world.\\n\\nUnlike Bitcoin, which specializes in payments, Ethereum has its own strength of being a platform, so it is difficult to compete with Bitcoin, which will also be a factor pushing up the price of Ethereum.\\n\\nPerhaps because of the promotion of the EEA, well-known large companies around the world are also keenly interested in development of Ethereum. [ https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development ]\\n\\nThe public evaluation of Ethereum is very high, and we can expect future price increases.\\n\\nSo how much will the price of Ethereum rise in the future?\\n\\nIt is not possible to perfectly predict how much Ethereum will rise in price in the future.\\n\\nHowever, if it rises steadily, Ethereum may rise to 5000 dollars in the future."}, {"upvote": 6, "content": "Ethereum isn't just a cryptocurrency.

At least for a while. And therefore many early adopters are looking for ways to make money with Ethereum. Here\\u2019s a few;\\n\\nParticipate in Ethereum bounties or airdrops\\n\\nProbably the simplest way for a newcomer to the cryptocurrency space to earn some ETH and other tokens is to participate in \\u201cbounties\\u201d and \\u201cairdrops\\u201d.\\n\\nCryptocurrency bounties are essentially online microtasks that pay a small amount in ETH or ERC-20 tokens for their completion. Some of the most popular bounty categories include writing articles, making tweets, or creating YouTube videos.\\n\\nYou can find these Ethereum bounties on dedicated platforms like Bounty0x, or in the \\u201cBounties\\u201d section of the Bitcointalk forum. There are no barriers of entry for participating, which makes it an interesting option to make money with Ethereum.\\n\\nAirdrops are essentially free coins that are sent to your wallet by projects that want to build a community. You will notice that often these coins are sent to your wallet without you having to do anything. However, in order to find the most lucrative airdrops, you will have to do some research and participate manually. An excellent place to get started is the popular site Airdrop Alert (airdropalert,com).\\n\\nEther mining\\n\\nIf you are a bit tech-savvy then you should probably consider starting mining Ether. Especially if you think that this digital asset will keep increasing in value for the next year or two. This is important because depending on what mining equipment you buy and how much electricity costs where you live, it can take up to 6 months to pay back your initial investment. For this to happen it is very important for the price of Ethereum to remain at its current price. Of course, if it increases then this timeframe will be even shorter!\\n\\nRather than mining to get Ethereum, I advise that you invest with trusted cryptocurrency investment companies like Coinstarhaven (www.coinstarhaven,com). A company that pays double of your invested cryptocurrency after 7 days. People use their cryptocurrencies in so many ways, this is basically how i use mine.\\n\\nIf you insist on going through the stress of mining your ethereum, check out 99bitcoins. The people over at 99bitcoins have built an Ether mining profitability calculator. I highly recommend you to check it out before you purchase your equipment. This way you will know beforehand if this little \\u201cventure\\u201d is going to be worth your time. Additionally, you will be able to predict how much money you will be earning from your mining rigs every month.\\n\\nBecome an Ethereum freelance programmer\\n\\nExperienced blockchain programmers can earn up to 300K USD per year. And since there are rather few programmers with these skills and the demand keeps rising, you can expect this salary to skyrocket even more in the coming months.\\n\\nOf course, we are talking about professional programmers with 5+ years of experience in the blockchain world. However, if you are interested in programming then it\\u2019s better to start learning now than never. One of the best resources I have found so far for learning blockchain programming is Basel Ismail\\u2018s answer on Quora. He wrote there a very extensive guide on how to get started. Another good resource is Blockgeeks,com, you will find their website especially if you are a beginner in the programming world.\\n\\nOnce you feel confident enough to start selling your services as a blockchain developer, you have many platforms to choose from. The biggest of all is definitely UpWork (upwork,com), there you\\u2019ll find many clients looking for people like you to complete their project. Secondly, there is (Freelancer,com), however, what I have noticed so far is that this platform is more focused on the lower end of the market. So you should expect to earn less on average on (Freelancer,com) than you would earn on another platform. And finally, there\\u2019s jobs.ethercast.com and moneo.io, both platforms are targeted at the upper end of the market. I recommend you that you make an account at these two once you have at least 2 years of experience.\\n\\nBlogging\\n\\nEvery time a new technology pops up, newcomers need blogs they can trust to get their information from. As I have seen on my Google Analytics dashboard, the interest for content like \\u201cWhat are some real world uses of Ethereum\\u201d or \\u201cEthereum price prediction 2017\\u201d has spiked like crazy. So If you are a good writer, a good researcher and you are passionate about cryptocurrencies, I strongly encourage you to start your own blog.\\n\\nOnce you get a decent amount of traffic you will be able to monetize it either by displaying Ads, selling courses, selling your own E-Book, or even through consulting services!\\n\\nMake Ethereum DApps\\n\\nEthereum has made the development of a completely new category of software possible.

It is this red dot that you see at the bottom right.\\n\\nThere are people who bought Bitcoin and Ethereum for a dollar and sold them for two or five because they multiplied their money. They turned out to be tragically wrong. For today's conscious investors, the placement is long term. They will not sell until Bitcoin becomes the new global reserve currency or Ethereum the global computer. The daily fluctuation of their exchange rate with the euro or the dollar is not something that concerns them. This investment philosophy remains to be seen if it will be right. Whether they will become new millionaires or their hopes turn out to be illusory.\\n\\nHere, will focus on the investment perspective of Ethereum, although to answer how high its price can reach, we must first know what the top will be for Bitcoin. It is a given that the course of the cryptocurrency leader will play a decisive role for the entire market. Nevertheless, the second cryptocurrency in capitalization has proven to have autonomous dynamics.\\n\\nBased on behavioral economics, Ethereum bears a strong resemblance to Bitcoin, as it has been heavily criticized. That it is useless, made of compressed air, is not safe, its variability is so heavily. However, his supporters believe that has a great narrative. A platform for planned money. That is why they claim that the cycle of its adoption and increase of its capitalization will be as explosive as that of Bitcoin.\\n\\nThese are different assets, different ecosystems, same adoption. Same in many places, but at the same time different. Let's see what Ethereum investors should pay attention to. The conditions that will make it score even higher than Bitcoin.\\n\\nThe focal points\\n\\n**CME futures on Ethereum starts right now. Their launch has raised expectations. Hedge funds and even insurance funds have the opportunity to have an exhibition in Ethereum. How do we know? Because from there many people also get a place in Bitcoin. It is difficult for them to acquire and, above all, maintain direct coins, as there is still the issue of the custodian that has not been reliably resolved. Why now; Because none of the institutionalists wanted to be first, nor last.\\n\\nSome are worried, because they have linked the start of Bitcoin futures again by CME, with its peak at the end of 2017. Indeed, they had contributed at the end of the party. Even Leo Melamed, President of the CME group, had stated that \\\"he will tame Bitcoin\\\". But the conditions were completely different then. Now Bluford Putnam, the group's chief economist, and chief executive told Bloomberg that Bitcoin is an \\\"emerging competitor\\\" to gold.\\n\\n**At the previous peak of Bitcoin in 2017, Ethereum reached $ 1,500. When Bitcoin surpassed $ 40,000, it had only $ 1,400. It seems to owe a significant increase. Maybe that's why in the last few days it broke the previous high of 2017. Also, a new historical high was noted by the addresses of Ethereum, which have even a minimal amount of money. They exceeded 53 million, according to Glassnode.\\n\\nIn addition, the price of Ethereum reached another milestone, which shows that this time the rise has a stronger basis. For the first time in its history, it remained over 30 days with a closing price of over $ 1,000. At the previous peak 3 years ago, he had only 25 days left above this limit. During the previous bull run, the volume of transactions in its network ranged between 1 and 4 billion dollars. It now stands at $ 12 billion, according to a Grayscale study.\\n\\n**There are high expectations associated with DeFi. Indicatively to mention that according to DappRadar, Uniswap, the most popular decentralized application reached 313,600 users in the last month. An application that did not exist until November 2018.\\n\\nThe faster they grow, the more they use the Ethereum platform and pay to use it. To motivate the Ethereum network to have remote computers keep data in the blockchain, it uses Ethereum currency (ETH) as a form of payment to fund the network. Anyone wishing to build an application on their network will have to pay transaction fees for the computing power required to use it. The amount of ETH required is decided by a method called GAS. As transactions increase, so does value creation.\\n\\n**Another factor that boosts its value is the stable coins category. More and more institutions are interested in issuing their own currency that is locked in the dollar or some other dominant currency. Demand for them is growing. Not only in the volume of currencies but also in the volume of transactions. Almost everything is based on the Ethereum blockchain.\\n\\n**Next is gaming (games) and NFT (digital valuables). Categories that have started to become very popular in recent months. This is something much bigger than most people understand. In a world where pandemic constraints prevail or digital applications are preferred for convenience, the undisputed trend is to make more and more use of the digital world. Whether for business activities and transactions or for games, meetings, socializing, entertainment.\\n\\nWhere success will be judged\\n\\nAll these ambitious plans and impressive prospects will remain mere ambitions if there is no transition to Ethereum 2. An upgraded version of today's Ethereum will solve the scalability hub. Not an easy job. Trying to upgrade today's Ethereum blockchain while it works is like trying to upgrade a jumbo jet in the air with thousands of passengers. It is better to build a new plane on the ground, inside a shed. So they decided to make a new blockchain. When completed, the old Ethereum will be merged with the new one and all applications will be upgraded.\\n\\nThe process will probably take two years until it reaches the final stage. However, even then it will not be a complete product. It is expected. Apple and Microsoft are constantly updating and improving their system. Ethereum will never be finalized. This is the new Internet. There will always be frequent upgrades. This is something that stands out with Bitcoin, which is dominated by stability.

Ethereum is essentially a decentralized application (DApps). * Dapps is an abbreviation for decentralized applications.\\n\\nBitcoin is intended to be used as a currency, and currency transaction information is registered on the blockchain. On the other hand, Ethereum, which is Dapps, can record / execute various application programs in the blockchain in addition to basic transaction information of virtual currency such as \\\"when, who, who, how much\\\" (smart contract). Is called)\\n\\nIt is known that by using this smart contract, it can be applied to transactions in many businesses, and it is possible to make important written contracts between companies and buy and sell services, so it is a very expandable system. Expected.\\n\\nIn other words, since any application can be developed and executed through the Ethereum platform, it is functioning as a new infrastructure utilizing virtual currency. The common currency used on this platform is the so-called Ether (ETH) that is distributed on virtual currency exchanges. The fact that the currency is mainly a development platform will be the reason why Ethereum is different from many virtual currencies.\\n\\nNo upper limit and half-life\\n\\nVirtual currencies such as Bitcoin have an issuance limit and are designed from the beginning to have a rare value. In addition, for virtual currencies with an issuance limit, mining also has a half-life, and there is a mechanism to gradually limit the amount of virtual currency mined.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Ethereum has the characteristic of being a virtual currency with no issuance limit. Another feature is that there is no issuance limit, so there is no half-life (the mining reward does not decrease). Since there is no upper limit, it is expected that the supply will be stable in the future as it will be a reason for miners who mine Ethereum for a long time to continue mining.\\n\\nVitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, said \\\"nothing in particular\\\" as to why Ethereum wasn't capped. Therefore, a new upper limit may be set in the future depending on the user's request and changes in the virtual currency environment.\\n\\nEthereum inventor is Vitalik Buterin\\n\\nEthereum is a cryptocurrency devised by Canadian Vitalik Buterin, who was 19 at the time. Vitalik Buterin was interested in cryptocurrencies from an early stage and has contributed to the industry by creating the Bitcoin magazine \\\"Bitcoin Magazine\\\".\\n\\nThe Ethereum white paper was released in 2013, and the following year, 2014, the Ethereum prototype was distributed.\\n\\nCan also be applied to ICO\\n\\nThe mechanism of Ethereum also attracted attention because it can be applied to \\\"ICO\\\", which is a fundraising method using virtual currency.\\n\\nEthereum can issue its own currency (token) called \\\"ERC20\\\".\\n\\nIn the days without ECR20 token development [ https://www.blockchainx.tech/erc20-token-development ] , the token specifications had to be changed according to the wallet and exchange. Creating a new currency was a daunting task, as it was basically not possible to transfer currencies that are not compatible with wallets or exchanges.\\n\\nHowever, with the introduction of ERC20 as a new currency standard, different currencies can now use the same interface. One of the features is that we were able to circulate many currencies based on Ethereum's ECR20 in this way.\\n\\nHow Ethereum works\\n\\nFeatures of smart contracts and Dapps\\n\\nDapps using smart contracts have the advantage that all transactions can be executed programmatically, so the cost is low, and the contents of transactions and contracts are always protected, so the risk of fraud such as currency escape can be reduced.\\n\\nIt also has the following features.\\n\\nOperation in a decentralized style that does not require a central administrator\\n\\nAnyone can use and refer to it for free (highly transparent)\\n\\nEnsuring safety with blockchain\\n\\nIt will be a very easy-to-use online development platform.\\n\\nEthereum mining method\\n\\nAs of March 2020, Ethereum mining uses a method called \\\"Proof of Work (PoW)\\\".\\n\\nPoW is a system that distributes newly issued virtual currency as a reward to the person who completes the calculation and verification to write to the blockchain at the time of remittance of virtual currency first. Basically, people with high specifications of the personal computer that performs mining are advantageous, and it can be said that it is a merit-based mining method. Electricity costs are very high, but some companies are mining with supercomputer-class computing power.\\n\\nHowever, Vitalik Buterin considered this huge power-hungry PoW a problem and proposed that Ethereum be moved to the \\\"Proof of Stake (PoS)\\\" in the future. PoS is a method of determining mining rewards by considering the amount of currency held by the miner and the holding period. With the introduction of PoS in the future, it is expected that the situation will change in which only some minors monopolize rewards.\\n\\nHistory of Ethereum\\n\\nThe DAO case\\n\\nIn Ethereum, on June 17, 2016, there was an incident called \\\"THE DAO Incident\\\" in which hackers stole the funds raised to establish an autonomous decentralized organization called DAO.\\n\\nApproximately 3.6 million ETH = Approximately 6 billion yen was hacked at the rate at that time, and this incident was targeted at the vulnerability of highly secure smart contracts, and it shook the entire virtual currency industry.\\n\\nBirth of Ethereum Classic with hard fork\\n\\nAfter the THE DAO incident, Ethereum decided to destroy the hacker's crime by duplicating the blockchain and developing it as a new Ethereum.\\n\\nHowever, more and more people are distrustful of Ethereum because the rule that \\\"blockchains are not tampered with or changed rules\\\", which is the basis of centralized authority without administrators, has been broken. As a result, many people will continue to use Ethereum before it is duplicated, and the former Ethereum still remains in the cryptocurrency market as \\\"Ethereum Classic\\\".\\n\\nThe hard fork (split) between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic is also an indispensable history when talking about Ethereum.\\n\\nEthereum update\\n\\nEthereum is gradually updating the system. There are four updates: Frontier, Homestead, Metropolis, and Serenity.\\n\\nThe third one has already been completed, and only Serenity, which is scheduled for 2021, remains.

It is an open source decentralized platform based on Blockchain technology that enables developers to deploy smart contracts.\\n\\nHow is it different from Bitcoin?\\n\\nLike Bitcoin, Ethereum is a distributed public blockchain network. Although there are some significant technical differences between the two, the most important distinction to note is that Bitcoin and Ethereum differ substantially in purpose and capability.\\n\\nBitcoin offers one particular application of blockchain technology, a peer to peer electronic cash system that enables online Bitcoin payments. While the Bitcoin blockchain is used to track ownership of digital currency (bitcoins), the Ethereum blockchain focuses on running the programming code of any decentralized application.\\n\\nWhat is a SMART CONTRACT?\\n\\nSmart contract is just a phrase used to describe computer code that can facilitate the exchange of money, content, property, shares, or anything of value. When running on the blockchain a smart contract becomes like a self-operating computer program that automatically executes when specific conditions are met. Because smart contracts run on the blockchain, they run exactly as programmed without any possibility of censorship, downtime, fraud or third party interference.\\n\\nHow is Ethereum being used?\\n\\n * Ethereum enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications.\\n * Any services that are centralized can be decentralized using Ethereum. From obvious services like loans provided by banks to intermediary services rarely thought about by most people like title registries, voting systems, regulatory compliance and much more.\\n * Ethereum can also be used to build Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO). A DAO is fully autonomous, decentralized organization with no single leader. DAO\\u2019s are run by programming code, on a collection of smart contracts written on the Ethereum blockchain. The code is designed to replace the rules and structure of a traditional organization, eliminating the need for people and centralized control. A DAO is owned by everyone who purchases tokens, but instead of each token equating to equity shares & ownership, tokens act as contributions that give people voting rights.\\nWhat are its benefits?\\n\\nBecause decentralized applications run on the blockchain, they benefit from all of its properties.\\n\\n * Immutability \\u2013 A third party cannot make any changes to data.\\n * Corruption & tamper proof \\u2013 Apps are based on a network formed around the principle of consensus, making censorship impossible.\\n * Secure \\u2013 With no central point of failure and secured using cryptography, applications are well protected against hacking attacks and fraudulent activities.\\n * Zero downtime \\u2013 Apps never go down and can never be switched off.\\nEdit:\\n\\nSome real world use cases of Ethereum:\\n\\n1. Health Industry: Ethereum will completely revolutionize the health-care system. All hospitals around the world can store, access and share their patient\\u2019s records. This is a key factor in developing new vaccines for viral outbreaks, or even preventing them in the first hand. You can go to a doctor in Thailand for a check up when you are on holidays and to a hospital in New York when you are back home again, and both will have the same information about you.\\n2. Security from hackers: The fact that there is no central server for a hacker to attack makes it a lot harder to break into, for example, a website and steal your personal information.\\n3. Transactions: The world\\u2019s economy is based on transactions\\u2026 And Ethereum is going to change them forever. On Ethereum, so-called \\u201csmart contracts\\u201d can be made. These make it possible to exchange anything of value, completely risk-free. Instead of creating an old-school agreement on paper, the transaction is recorded in computer code. So imagine that instead of buying a photo from a platform like Shutterstock, you buy it directly from the photographer and initiate a contract with him/ her to buy the photo. This is made possible by the \\u201cIf This Then That\\u201d (IFTTT) logic built deeply into Ethereum\\u2019s system.\\n4. Privacy from third parties: You know that search engine that most of the world\\u2019s internet users use every single day? Yeah, the one with the capital \\u201cG\\u201d. Well, surprise surprise, the company collects your personal information and sells it to advertisers. And makes billions in profit every year in the process. Ethereum\\u2019s blockchain technology would make this data collection impossible. Actually, it does not make it impossible (Nothing is impossible :P), but it logs every time the search engine uses your data and makes those logs publicly available. Therefore, large corporations will have to be a lot more careful with what they do with our data if they don\\u2019t want their brand image to suffer.\\n5. Politics: The fact that you are reading this post means that you are a well-educated citizen, and you are very likely more intelligent than the average Joe. Therefore, it is also very likely that once every couple years (depending on what country you live in), you will register your vote for the political party you think should lead your country. But result can be altered and that happens more often than not. This would be physically impossible with the implementation of ethereum since nobody has the complete control over the network and every change is logged and publicly visible. Therefore, ethereum will ensure a more transparent and fair democracy.\\n6. Storing data: Companies like Dropbox or Microsoft [ https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/ethereum-blockchain-as-a-service-now-on-azure/ ] store huge amounts of data in so-called server farms. A server farm is basically a building where hundreds of servers are that are used to store information. The problem with server farms is that the company concentrates a large fraction of its storage capacity on a single location. Therefore, the company can suffer substantial losses if it is destroyed by a natural disaster or a terrorist attack. The solution is a decentralized storage facility. In that case, information is not stored in a couple server farms in the US, but in hundreds (or even thousands!) of data centers all around the world. Until now this has not been possible because it is a big technological challenge to build a network that connects all those servers safely and enables a fast data-transfer. However, Ethereum is very likely to be the solution to this problem because it\\u2019s blockchain technology can be used to encrypt and quickly transfer data between millions of servers.\\nAnd there are countless other possibilities and areas of improvement for this technology.\\n\\nHope you liked this answer\\u2026would like to hear your queries and thoughts.\\n\\nPeace :)"}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "If the blockchain ecosystem were a city, Ethereum would be its infrastructure.

Satoshi originally wrote the code of Bitcoin in C++, and it follows a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus model. PoW means that every transaction is verified by a miner who is then rewarded with new Bitcoins as verification reward/fees. Miners use their hardware\\u2019s computation power to solve complex mathematical problems that verify the transactions. The fees paid during the transaction by the sending party is given in Bitcoin only.\\n\\nThe Ethereum blockchain follows a hash algorithm named Ethash, which is written in a variety of languages, including Go, C#, C++, Java, Rust, and Python. The smart contracts made using Ethereum\\u2019s blockchain are generally coded by using Solidity. The Ethereum network is shifting from PoW to Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain consensus. Every transaction is verified by miners who, instead of using their hardware\\u2019s computation power, they stake their coins to verify the transaction process. Miners get an annual return on the staked cryptocurrency. The fees/ gas paid during the transaction process by the sending party is called Ether.\\n\\nUsage\\n\\nBitcoin's only application is to act as decentralized money and store of value, which means it is an alternative to fiat money and traditional investments. It is a superior option for cross border transactions since they cost considerable fees and take quite a while to process. However, Bitcoin is seen more as an asset rather than a technology or a method of transaction.\\n\\nTechnologically speaking, if Bitcoin is blockchain 1.0, Ethereum is blockchain 2.0. It features everything that Bitcoins has, plus more. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum can be used for cross-border transactions, with faster transaction speed and higher transaction scalability. Additionally, Ethereum can host dApps and smart contracts. That means programmers can code and use Ethereum\\u2019s blockchain network to develop their cryptocurrencies, decentralized software, and many more platforms.\\n\\nAll in all, the significant difference between both the blockchain networks is the separation of roles.

There is no core leader\\uff0cso any changes to Bitcoin's maintenance are determined by community discussions. However, according to the concept, people in the community can be roughly divided into two groups. One is to implement the initial concept of Satoshi Satoshi firmly. The other is to improve Bitcoin based on actual conditions. When someone proposes to make some changes to Bitcoin, it is very difficult for the community to reach a consensus, so no consensus can be reached.\\n\\nBitcoin's revision plan will be delayed.

Of course, the cost is higher, the chance of being mined is bigger and the transaction processing is faster.\\n\\nThe average mining time of Ethereum is 12 seconds. Six confirmations are one minute or more. The transaction processing speed is obviously much faster than bitcoin. His transaction cost is determined by the gas value of the operation consumption. The consumption value is set by the transaction initiator. When the gas is consumed and the transaction has not been executed, the transaction will be stopped, but the consumed gas will not be returned and the transaction will return to the initial state.\\n\\nEthereum is a turing complete, smart contract that can run a variety of methods, and Bitcoin can only accept some simple methods.

Things companies like EOS and QuantmRE [ http://bit.ly/2OSRGAn ] are doing some pretty incredible things that will certainly draw in more developer interest to create their DApps on such platforms. At the end of the day, the network of any of these cryptocurrencies is only as valuable as the service of which they've tokenized and the amount of adoption they have among their ecoystems, but especially with developers if they allow for making Decentralized Apps, then you could look at it and make a comparison of Apple's App store vs Google Play. Which would be your preference?\\n\\nRegardless of the answer, these two options aren't the only options but are most well-known to those in the U.S.. In places like China however, there are an even greater number of app stores that are mostly controlled by the phone carriers themselves. The main takeaway is: if you're looking at things long-term it's actually a good time to buy Ethereum, but it's also a good idea to look into other altcoins while the market is still rather bearish and the upward swing potential is huge. Look for companies that have something to protect them from the market volatility all alt-coins are victim of. If a company (like QuantmRE) for instance is able to back their tokens/curency with real-world assets, such as real estate or other commodities as some companies (including IBM) stable coins is becoming very attractice to crypto investors right now.\\n\\nWhatever your choice may be, make sure to do your own research."}, {"upvote": 13, "content": "What are some predictions for the Ethereum price by 2018?\\n\\nIt seems that most of the answers on here are from last year (2017) so I guess I'll possibly be a first to do one for 2018.\\nHonestly, it wouldn't surprise me if this company entered the top 10 in trading volume this year but what else is interesting is that despite ETH exceeding others expectations on price increases, it may just be the beginning for what we can expect from the currency that is certainly rivaling Bitcoin itself.\\n\\nI'm sure just a few years ago people expected that BTC, and LTC would be the primary coins representing the Cryptocurrency markets, but it's interesting to see that (as of writing) LTC is still only worth $180, whereas Bitcoin is over $11,000. Some have argued that LTC should be worth at least 1/10th of the value of BTC, which would mean that the currency is undervalued because it would need to be worth over $1,000 to make that true.\\n\\nHowever, in consideration of the fact that the underlying technology that makes ETH what it is, is not the same as what is powering BTC. Sure, they both utilize blockchain technology - but they're also different. The thing is what will really provide a more accurate prediction of where ETH's price is likely to be by the end of Q1 in 2018, Q2, Q3, and Q4 is not so much in the price itself, but in the adoption of the decentralized platform itself that pave the way for developers, creators, and entrepreneurs to make with the technology what they will.\\n\\nWill all ETH companies succeed? \\nNo. Of course not.\\n\\nA business regardless of how they transact is still susceptible to the same success/failure rate that any business falls under.

Below, allow me to explain what could potentially make Ethereum crumble and what could make Ethereum skyrocket.\\n\\nDisaster scenarios:\\n\\n1. China, South Korea and other Asian countries ban cryptocurrency trading and mining. We\\u2019ve already seen cryptos across the board plummet by -20% within the hour just because of *speculation* that Asian governments might ban trading and mining. Just imagine if they actually see that threat through.\\n2. Another major exchange gets hacked. Could you imagine if Coinbase got hacked? You\\u2019d see the price of all cryptos deflate like a popped balloon within seconds. With the proliferation of cryptos and resulting exchanges, we should expect more exchanges to get hacked in 2018. Depending on the size of the hacked exchanges, you may see prices either barely move or you may see the Earth split in two.\\n3. Buterin and Ethereum developers get hacked and/or fail to deliver on their lofty promises. If there were to be a successful attack on the very Ethereum core team you could see Ether (and Ether alone) plunge dramatically.\\nPayday scenarios:\\n\\n1. Buterin & Co. implement Casper/Proof of Stake. This is a \\u201cfirst to the finish line\\u201d race out of the major cryptos and Ethereum is easily leading the way. Whenever (not if ever) Ethereum implements PoS, hold on tight because it\\u2019s going to be wild. If Bitcoin doesn\\u2019t switch to PoS at the same time you could easily see Ether overtake Bitcoin on the coin value to USD pair within a short span of time.\\n2. Corporations and/or major developers start utilizing Ethereum for everyday processes or decentralized apps are released to the public. Both of these would drive demand for Ether up dramatically as more and more potential holders seek to buy and either up their stake in Ether or enter for the first time.\\n3. Bitcoin continues to not really do anything useful. It\\u2019s interesting how Bitcoin has primarily become little more than a store of value rather than an actual currency. With the current technical headwinds that Bitcoin is facing, we shouldn\\u2019t expect this to change any time soon. I mean there are very good reasons why major corporations are flocking to Ethereum and not to Bitcoin. I suspect that we will continue to see that trend continue here in 2018, if not speed up even more.\\nThose are the biggest factors that I can think of. Of course all of this is not to be taken as any kind of investment advice as I am no financial adviser. I am merely someone who is very excited about the potential of cryptocurrency from both a real-world application standpoint and from a personal investment standpoint.

Privateum Global - World\\u2019s first platform fully owned by its token holders:\\nPrivateum - Worl'd 1st Platform Owned by Its Token Holders [ https://www.privateum.com/ ]\\n\\nAs what their slogan says you own PRI tokens and become part of owning their platform.\\n\\nIt was around 2 $ a few months ago when I had invested in this token and currently it\\u2019s 5.4 $ at the moment of writing. Damn, I wish I had invested more than 3000$ at that time. As I see they are really growing even in the bear market their token doesn\\u2019t seem to go down at all. \\nI\\u2019d recommend to read whitepapers all the time, not scan it but actually read it and if you have open questions feel free to contact the team behind each project.\\n\\nhttps://www.privateum.com/PrivateumWhitepaperv2.0.pdf\\n\\nMoreover, I have learned from their offical telegram chat Privateum Official [ https://t.me/privateum_official ] that they are going to have a marketplace such as ebay and amazon so that means your PRI tokens will have real life values. Users will be able to do both: have a merchant acount and start selling products and services in PRI tokens as well as they may use PRI to purchase anything they wish inside the platform.\\n\\nAnother cool thing that caught my eye, they do not advertise it publicly, but after some research I was able to find out that the private wallet they offer assures some privacy and seems untraceable.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I feel this token has massive potential as all the promises have been kept so far.\\n\\n2. Midas Investments - Next generation passive crypto income:\\n\\nNext-gen passive crypto income \\u2014 Midas.Investments [ https://midas.investments/ ]\\n\\nI am on this project for more than 6 months already and within this period I have earned massively on stable cryptocurrencies such as USDT and BUSD. Initially they were offering around 19% of APY on stable cryptos, however perhaps due to current bear market conditions the percentage went down to 14 %, which is still great, isn\\u2019t it? Average banks offer you 3\\u20136 % per year in dollar or in euro and yet you have to sign loads of papers and if one bank knows how much money you own so the others know by default. Their token MIDAS is a nice gem too, even though it\\u2019s volatile and behaves pretty much the same way as any other top cryptocurrencies it proves to win most of the world\\u2019s best tokens. As an example I had configured to earn my earnings on stable currencies to receive in Midas token while it was around 25$ and now it\\u2019s 42$ at the moment of writing. I made my 2500$ of investments in Midas close to 6000$ so far. Could be more, but I have invested some of my assets in high risk pools inside the MIdas platofrm and that caused me of some little losses.\\n\\n3. BNB token - I know I may contradict to my previous statement at the beggining that I do not believe in top cryptocurrenices, however I like holding loads of BNBs for a few reasons:\\n\\nFirst of all BNB is the \\u201cgodfather\\u201d of all the BSC backed tokens.

In fact, several financial institutions have even began providing BTC to their customers.\\n\\nThe cryptocurrency industry is about to grow even more in 2022.\\n\\nEthereum (ETH)\\n\\nMarket Cap: $496.949 Billion\\n\\nETH\\u2019s relative infancy compared to its rival Bitcoin means that it is ready to follow in Bitcoin's footsteps. The development team recently introduced the second-gen, ETH 2, complete with smart contracts, which has considerably increased the reliability and speed of the blockchain and promises to great reduce gas fees The token markets are booming as Ethereum has some of the biggest operations like in gaming retail. For example, PokerStars took out an offer with 20 million tokens sold in 3 minutes.\\n\\nAvalanche (AVAX)\\n\\nAnother leading cryptocurrency is Avalanche, an Ethereum-based token that\\u2019s gaining momentum fast. Like its major rivals, the digital currency was made on the blockchain with cryptographic security and very fast transaction speeds.\\n\\nHowever, Avalanche is distinct in that it was the first project to produce a working functioning prototype of a bigger cryptographic puzzle.\\n\\nAnother major strength of Avalanche is its team, which has a majority of individuals with experience in the blockchain industry with the biggest investors in the crypto space backing it.\\n\\nThis shouldn\\u2019t come as a surprise, given Avalanche has been designed to be an ecosystem of decentralized applications. As such, the decentralized application releases its Avalanche Coin (AVAX), an Ethereum token.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s why you should buy a cryptocurrency like Avalanche, the likelyhood of Avalanche reaching the price of ETH is highly likely. This could mean newly minted AVAX millionaires in 2022.\\n\\nBinance (BNB, BSC)\\n\\nBinance is an exchange that offers a unique user experience. They have 4 cryptocurrency support options: cryptocurrency trading, fiat trading, foreign exchange trading, and mobile trading.\\n\\nBNB charges the lowest commission out of the rest, and their algorithm has a low trading volume. It's not the cheapest to open an account, but their exchange platform is user friendly and instant. With each BNB / BSC coin reaching over $600 in value so far in 2021 from under $50, investors are adding this one to their portfolios as quick as the can buy it.\\n\\nSolana (SOL)\\n\\nSolana is a small cryptocurrency with the best privacy features, and has a decentralized network that has transaction or gas fees that are barely noticeable. Traders on the Solana network pay pennies compared to hundreds of dollars on the Ethereum Network. It has the highest network hashrate, and has been the most valuable coin for the past week. Solana is now the first viable cryptocurrency to implement the Lightning Network. Solana has a large community, and many developers.\\n\\nSolana, the \\u201cworld\\u2019s first Internet of Things blockchain,\\u201d was launched last recently by a developer team known as HIVE Blockchain Technologies. A subsidiary of HIVE, Solana makes a built-in secure blockchain to support smart contract operations in internet of things (IoT) and robotics. This is similar to the approach taken by Ethereum. Solana smart contracts can also manage limited aspects of IoT. This makes Solana attractive for use cases with high potential for scalability. The market for smart contracts is projected to be about $345 million by 2026.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nI hope you are able to capitalize on the transformation that the worldwide financial system is undergoing.

A couple of weeks ago, all cryptocurrencies were free-falling. Some crypto coins collapsed in a glimpse.\\n\\nTo invest in crypto, you should understand a blockchain and the technology behind it. I think you can hardly find a person who hasn't heard anything about blockchain. Still, not many people understand what it's about. Basically, it's a chain of blocks with a long row of letters and digits(hash) in it. Hash encodes any transaction within the network. Blockchain is the cornerstone of all decentralized systems, including decentralized finance(DeFi). As you can understand from the name, it's a financial transaction system without any regulator above it. All your everyday financial operations are supervised by some financial entity. Usually, it's your local bank with the central bank at the top of the pyramid.\\n\\nDeFi has no such regulator at all. All the transactions inside the system are approved by the participants. This method has some pros and cons:\\n\\n+ It is very hack resistant. As blocks in blockchain have their unique hash number, all the computers in the network know the hashes of the blocks in the sequence. In order to hack one block, you have to change the hashes in the blocks of the sequence on all the computers. Which is almost impossible to execute because these networks include thousands or hundreds of thousands of computers.\\n\\n- All the blockchain systems are critical to the agreement mechanism between the participants. In a blockchain, it is called a consensus mechanism. Basically, it\\u2019s how members of the network decide how they approve blocks in the blockchain. Because these systems have no one primary regulator and, at the same time, a guarantor of all the transactions, the network participants take this role. For approving the blocks, they get rewards in coins.\\n\\nAccording to this, blockchain consensus is divided into two different approaches:\\n\\na) Proof of work(PoW). In other words, \\\"mining.\\\" Your role in the consensus mechanism depends on your calculating power. This mechanism has one significant disadvantage - it requires a lot of energy.\\n\\nb) Proof of stake(PoS). Opposite to proof of work, the role of the participants in the consensus mechanism is distributed in proportion to the number of coins on the account. This method requires significantly less amount of energy than PoW.\\n\\nYou should be aware of this information for us to move on further. We won't stop at these two concepts for too long. Maybe I'll talk about them in the following posts.\\n\\nWhy do I think Ethereum is a good option for investment?\\n\\nHere are four major points:\\n\\n1. Ethereum was created in 2013. In 2015 they launched the network with:\\n\\na) decentralized applications. Everyone can locate their application into it for people to interact with it.\\n\\nb) decentralized finance apps perform financial services bypassing financial institutions.\\n\\nc) Ethereum network allows NFT.\\n\\nAs you can see Ethereum is expanding to something more than just a coin. It has a vast opportunities for scaling into a separate decentralized environment with Ethereum coin at its core.\\n\\n2. Initially, Ethereum worked as a PoW coin. Still, it was announced that in several years Ethereum will become a PoS coin - Ethereum 2.0. This transition from Ethereum 1.0 to Ethereum 2.0 is expected to be in 2023.\\n\\n3. Ethereum is burning coins worth millions of dollars. Why are they doing it? Crypto Coins are known for their instability and volatile behavior. Burning coins helps to make them deflationary and more reliable to work with.\\n\\n4. Invest in people, not ideas. Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin is passionate about public goods; he always speaks about something that will be useful for humanity in general. Partly the reason of Ethereum 2.0 transition is to lower the overall cryptocurrencies energy consumption.This is a strong foundation for great investments. Investments just for investments are pointless; they must serve not only your benefit but also the prosperity of society."}, {"upvote": 33, "content": "The best cryptocurrency to buy depends on your familiarity with digital assets and risk tolerance. Here are the five (5) cryptocurrency I feel are important to invest today.\\n\\n\\u2022Bitcoin (BTC)\\n\\nThe closest thing you'll get to a blue-chip cryptocurrency, Bitcoins has dominated the market since the first bitcoins were mined in January 2009 \\u2013 but that doesn't mean it has always been smooth sailing. Bitcoin has its fair share of volatility, as prices have pulled back since hitting this high, but being the biggest name in crypto gives it a worldwide acceptance that lesser-known rivals don't have, arguably making it the best cryptocurrency to buy for investors new to the asset class.\\n\\n\\u2022Ethereum (ETH)\\n\\nOne of the main philosophies behind cryptocurrencies is the decentralization of currency. Ethereum takes that a step further \\u2013 rather than decentralizing money, Ethereum's goal is to decentralize the internet by replacing servers with a worldwide system of nodes, creating one computer for the entire world. Ethereum is a software platform based off blockchain technology in which users can exchange a cryptocurrency called ether. Ether has become one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world, with a market cap approaching $139 billion that puts it second only to Bitcoin in market share. But the real draw is the platform itself, which has become wildly popular as a host for other cryptocurrencies \\u2013 in other words, not only do investors profit from one of the best and most popular cryptocurrencies on the market, but also from the wider uses of Ethereum itself.\\n\\n\\u2022Litecoin (LTC)\\n\\nCryptocurrencies tend to seem obscure and complex to those who don't understand the underlying technology, but Litecoin was created to help fix that. In fact, founder Charlie Lee wanted to create the lite version of Bitcoin and develop a cryptocurrency that could play the role of silver to Bitcoin's gold. While bitcoin transactions take about 10 minutes to confirm, litecoin transactions are far faster, taking less than three minutes. In addition, while it takes specialized hardware and impressive raw computing power for users to mine bitcoin, Litecoin has much lower system requirements \\u2013 in fact, ordinary PCs are capable of mining for it. Faster and easier is a powerful combination for users and investors alike.\\n\\n\\u2022Chainlink (LINK)\\n\\nThe Ethereum platform is predicated on smart contracts, or agreements between two parties on a blockchain network with the transaction recorded in blocks of data. The problem is that these transactions can only occur on a platform like Ethereum, and they need some way to draw real-world data into the platform in order to execute smart contracts when certain conditions are met. The solution is data providers called oracles, and while several crypto platforms have created ways for oracles to retrieve data for their network, Chainlink has come up with a reputation system that guarantees the data is accurate, ensuring the validity of smart contracts. Once an oracle's data is verified, they are paid with Link, Chainlink's cryptocurrency of choice. This system builds confidence in the platform, and the growing popularity of decentralized finance, or DeFi, helps make Link a contender for the best cryptocurrency.\\n\\n\\u2022Tron (TRX)\\n\\nThe past year brought extreme upheaval within the entertainment industry, leaving it ripe for disruption. This is exactly the sort of opportunity the founders of Tron must have been hoping for when they built a decentralized, blockchain-based platform for sharing content. Whereas many of the biggest entertainment companies in the world profit from gathering and selling data about their users, using Tron leaves no such footprints behind. While it protects users, Tron also allows creators to monetize their content directly via Tronix, Tron's form of cryptocurrency. The platform has gained fame and notoriety in equal measure over the last few years due to the antics of Tron Foundation founder Justin Sun, but no matter how you feel about him, it's undeniable that Tron is an ambitious idea.\\n\\nOthers are;\\n\\n\\u2022Cardano (ADA)\\n\\n\\u2022Proton (XPR)\\n\\n\\u2022Binance Coin (BNB)\\n\\n\\u2022Conclusion and Advise.\\n\\nThe best cryptocurrency to buy depends on your familiarity with digital assets and risk tolerance but I would advise you seek for a professional crypto analyst and advisor to help manage your portfolio or gain signals from her forum that can help you trade.

Cryptocurrency functions both as currency and as a virtual accounting system. A digital currency exchange, Coinbase, for example, lists 10 \\u201cavailable\\u201d cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.\\n\\nIn order to use cryptocurrency, you need a cryptocurrency or \\u201cdigital\\u201d wallet such as Coinbase. Using Bitcoin has attracted many people for many reasons including fast and free international transactions that are censorship-resistant and decentralized while providing a safer and cheaper way for merchants to do business. However, using Bitcoin to fund personal financial accounts tends to spark more protective actions from its users.\\n\\nWhen deciding whether to tread the waters of cryptocurrency, consider yourself well-advised to explore all potential hazards:\\n\\n * Under-insured or not insured: Because cryptocurrency is so new, insurance companies are reluctant to cover it. Designing insurance plans and pricing typically requires more information than is available. Their lack of faith in this sector also leads them to believe the premiums will not be large enough to cover their losses.\\n * Hacking: Hacking into your cryptocurrency account is as simple as discovering your login credentials. Being fooled by a single email phishing attack can be like handing over your digital wallet to a thief. Once the hackers have phished your login credentials, they can transfer all your cryptocurrency to another account and you\\u2019ll never be able to recoup it. In addition to knowing a phishing attack when you see one, you\\u2019ll have to know how to spot fake websites, which simulate the official exchange websites so well they can trick you into providing your login information.\\n * Losing your wallet: If you lose your wallet, you can lose your entire investment if you don\\u2019t have a wallet backup. Human error can be the most fatal risk associated with cryptocurrency, so be careful not to lock yourself out of your account, forget your password or forget to back up your wallet.\\nOne of the few certainties about cryptocurrency is risk. Before taking a leap, do extensive research. For example, there are several cryptocurrency investment companies surfacing in the cryptospace that believe in the future potential of cryptocurrencies. For example, the Coinstarhaven company (www.coinstarhaven,com), a trusted billion-dollar investment company that pays double your cryptocurrency investments after 7 days.

In fact, the top 20 cryptocurrencies account for 89% of the total market -- the other 1,638 cryptocurrencies are worth a combined $39.6 billion.\\n\\nA more representative statistic is that the median cryptocurrency's market cap is just $925,000, meaning that half are worth more and half are worth less.\\n\\nThe largest cryptocurrencies by market cap\\n\\nFor this reason, it's important to realize that there aren't 1,658 relevant cryptocurrencies.

Here Mark Ellis - a research executive at the firm - gives us a layman's guide.\\n\\nWhat are cryptocurrencies?\\n\\nCryptocurrencies differ from traditional currencies in a number of ways, the most obvious being that they are an electronic form of currency. In addition, they aren\\u2019t backed by any physical commodity or by a central agency, such as the government.\\n\\nAnyone can gain access to cryptocurrency. An individual will need a cryptocurrency wallet to store a digital key that will allow them to access the address of the cryptocurrency. Wallets are typically web-based or app based, allowing users to access and view their balance as an online banking app does.\\n\\nHow much are cryptocurrencies worth?\\n\\nThe value of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ether, is based upon a shared belief amongst individuals that it has value and can be used in exchange for goods and services, as well as a store of wealth.\\n\\nUnlike previous digital currencies, cryptocurrencies do not have a central body recording and monitoring the use of the currency. This decentralisation is one the key benefits derived from the underlying technology, blockchain.\\n\\nWhat are blockchains?\\n\\nBlockchains are ledgers distributed amongst a peer-to-peer network, with blocks in each ledger representing a new record or transaction. Each new block contains encrypted information from the previous block in addition to a timestamp and the transaction data.\\n\\nHowever, new blocks can only be added to the chain once they have been verified by all of the individuals within the network. With the network recording and verifying every transaction, there isn\\u2019t a need for a central server or authority and this system ensures tokens cannot be spent twice, a key flaw in previous digital currencies.\\n\\nCould they become an alternative to traditional currencies?\\n\\nThe rise in popularity of a number of cryptocurrencies over the past two years has caused many to question whether they could become a viable alternative to physical currency. However, the perceived complexity of cryptocurrencies has dissuaded many consumers from using them.\\n\\nThere has also been increasing pressure from central bodies to make cryptocurrency transactions more transparent. This has the potential to limit widespread uptake and potentially detract from the value that investors perceive the currencies to have.\\n\\nHow can this be overcome?\\n\\nIncreasing participation will be critical in enabling cryptocurrencies to become an alternative to traditional currencies. As the market size for cryptocurrencies increases and prices become less susceptible to market transactions, the volatility should decrease. This in turn should increase cryptocurrencies credentials as a store of wealth.\\n\\nDue to these factors, cryptocurrencies could open the financial system to those that would typically struggle to participate, i.e. those with poor credit scores or no address; a country will benefit from the increasing number of consumers, supporting economic growth. At present, the volatility poses a serious risk to businesses profit margins, meaning that retailers have shown caution in accepting cryptocurrencies as a form of payment."}, {"upvote": 27, "content": "Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies in which transactions are verified and records maintained by a decentralized system using cryptography, rather than by a centralized authority.\\n\\nIt can also be said to be any form of currency that only exists digitally, that usually has no central issuing or regulating authority but instead uses a decentralized system to record transactions and manage the issuance of new units, and that relies on cryptography to prevent counterfeiting and fraudulent transactions"}, {"upvote": 298, "content": "The fact that cryptocurrencies are digital is not the only important difference between cryptocurrencies and traditional currencies like U.S. dollars.\\n\\nBefore i continue, let me introduce you to a platform i discovered where you can sell your Bitcoin and other top Cryptocurrencies at the exact rate in dollars any where in the world.

Thank me later after using this platform.\\n\\nCryptocurrencies aren\\u2019t backed by a government.\\n\\nCryptocurrencies are not insured by the government like U.S. bank deposits are. This means that cryptocurrency stored online does not have the same protections as money in a bank account.

Don\\u2019t invest money you can\\u2019t afford to lose.\\n\\nNot all cryptocurrencies \\u2014 or companies promoting cryptocurrency \\u2014 are the same.\\n\\nLook into the claims that companies promoting cryptocurrency are making.

For example, if you need to dispute a purchase, your credit card company has a process to help you get your money back. Cryptocurrency payments typically are not reversible. Once you pay with cryptocurrency, you only can get your money back if the seller sends it back.\\n\\nBefore you buy something with cryptocurrency, know a seller\\u2019s reputation, where the seller is located, and how to contact someone if there is a problem.\\n\\nRefunds might not be in cryptocurrency.\\n\\nIf refunds are offered, find out whether they will be in cryptocurrency, U.S. dollars, or something else. And how much will your refund be? The value of a cryptocurrency changes constantly. Before you buy something with cryptocurrency, learn how the seller calculates refunds.\\n\\nSome information will likely be public.\\n\\nAlthough cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous, the transactions may be posted to a public ledger, like Bitcoin\\u2019s blockchain. A blockchain is a public list of records that shows when someone transacts with cryptocurrency. Depending on the cryptocurrency, the information added to the blockchain can include information like the transaction amount. The information also can include the sender\\u2019s and recipient\\u2019s wallet addresses \\u2014 a long string of numbers and letters linked to a digital wallet that stores cryptocurrency.

You\\u2019ve probably been hearing more and more about it on the news, and heard people talking about it more. But there are those who\\u2019ve been just reading the headlines and discussing it \\u2014 while others are busy getting to work on becoming part of this revolution \\u2014 and grabbing the huge opportunities.\\n\\nAluxers, if you\\u2019re still not convinced of what opportunities crypto has to offer, we\\u2019re going to spell it out for you here.\\n\\nWith that provided, let\\u2019s jump right into the article and learn about the first reason why we should be going all in on crypto.\\n\\nAfter so many failed attempt on getting the right platform, I came across Libraforex Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www.libraforex,io) where i get different percentages on every investment i made with cryptocurrency every 10 days. It looks too good to be true until i gave it a try and trust me it has been a smooth ride all the way. Don\\u2019t give up on cryptocurrency and join the platform. Trust me, you won\\u2019t care about the price fluctuation anymore. Thank me Later.\\n\\nPS: This is not in any case of me trying to lure you into anything for my own personal financial gain, i am just innocently sharing so that you could gain one or two things as this has been working for me. You can also make a research on what works for you too.\\n\\n1\\n\\nIt Will Be the Main Currency in the Future\\n\\nOne thing that the economic crisis of 2008 showed us is that traditional banking systems are flawed. And it\\u2019s been confirmed in 2020. More and more people are seeing the need for viable alternatives. And that\\u2019s exactly what crypto offers \\u2014 a secure, decentralized form of banking, that takes governments and banks out of the equation.\\n\\nAnd the crazy thing is, that even banks realize it. Just listen to what Germany\\u2019s Deutsche Bank have to say. In their \\u2018Imagine 2030\\u2019 report, they talk about how fragile the traditional money system is \\u2014 that by 2030, over 200 million people will be using digital money \\u2014 and by then, traditional money will already be on the way out.\\n\\nAnd it\\u2019s not just Deutsche Bank. Twitter\\u2019s Jack Dorsey has said he believes Bitcoin will eventually become the world\\u2019s single currency. Elon Musk has stated that \\u2018crypto is a far better way to transfer value than a piece of paper.\\u2019 China State TV has called Blockchain \\u2014 the technology that makes crypto possible \\u2014 10 times more valuable than the internet.\\n\\n2\\n\\nYou Need to Get Familiarized With the Technology\\n\\nIt\\u2019s the biggest technological invention since the internet. So, if you \\u2018re still not up to speed with it, you\\u2019re behind. But the good news is, you\\u2019re still in time to start playing catch-up.\\n\\nJust like in the 90s, when the internet was taking off, there were those who resisted adapting to it. There will be those people with the blockchain and crypto revolution \\u2014 but do you really want to be one of them?\\n\\nAnd just like we now rely on the internet for information and communications \\u2014 soon it\\u2019s going to be the same for financial transactions using blockchain. So if you\\u2019re not familiar with using it yet now\\u2019s the time \\u2014 what are you waiting for?\\n\\n3\\n\\nYou will position yourself better for opportunities in this space\\n\\nSure, you can make and receive payments with a crypto account. You can use it to save. But the really big opportunities come with investing in crypto.\\n\\nJust take a look at Bitcoin. If you\\u2019d invested $100 in it just 5 years ago, by now that $100 would be worth $2 500. Or if you\\u2019d got in really early with that $100 ten years ago, be worth $1.9 million.\\n\\nThe price of Bitcoin is still set to keep on going up. Sure, with blips here and there. And to be fair, probably not as dramatically as it did before. Other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, Ripple and Lisk also have huge potential to grow, and bring great returns to savvy investors.\\n\\nBut to know which coins to invest in, and when you do need to get educated \\u2014 and get some experience under your belt. So why waste any time? Now\\u2019s the time to get crypto-savvy and learn to spot the opportunities \\u2014 because you can be sure, there are huge opportunities waiting.\\n\\n4\\n\\nIt\\u2019s a Solid Alternative for Saving Your Money\\n\\nWe\\u2019ve already talked about crypto\\u2019s long-term upwards trend. Let\\u2019s compare that with regular money. If you took $100 in cash, buried it, and waited 10 years, the amount you could buy with it a decade later could be a lot less than when you put it in the ground. Because of inflation. And leaving it in a bank account isn\\u2019t going to be much better \\u2014 if at all. Because of the interest rates in bank accounts, which vary from zero to extremely low.\\n\\nDisclaimer \\u2014 yes, crypto is more volatile than most currencies, largely because it\\u2019s still new, and gaining traction. Like at the start of 2018 when the price of Bitcoin tanked. Remember, it\\u2019s more or less recovered since then. And it\\u2019s upward trend is likely to continue, and win out on any volatility. And that\\u2019s what makes it such a great option for long-term saving \\u2014 something that will beat any interest rated banks can give you.\\n\\n5\\n\\nYou Are Safe From Inflation\\n\\nSo, we were just talking about inflation. Let\\u2019s spell that out in full. The problem with traditional money is that it\\u2019s always going down in value. And this isn\\u2019t by accident. Governments and central banks do it on purpose. Especially when there\\u2019s a financial crisis. Like the one in 2008, or the one this year, in 2020.\\n\\nAt times like these, there\\u2019s a shortage of money. And governments try to get around it by just printing more. In fact, 22% of all dollars that exist today were created in 2020, when the Federal Reserve injected $2 trillion into the economy.\\n\\nMaking money appear out of thin air, might sound pretty neat. Until you figure out the catch. There may be more money \\u2014 but the amount of goods and services it\\u2019s chasing stays the same. And the value of money goes down compared with the value of those goods and services. And that\\u2019s what we call inflation.\\n\\nThat\\u2019s why smart people trust gold more than money. Because when there\\u2019s an economic crisis, new gold doesn\\u2019t just magically appear out of nowhere. And it holds its value. And Bitcoin and other crypto \\u2014 just like gold \\u2014 don\\u2019t get created as a short-term fix to financial problems. That means it crypto also holds its value. And it\\u2019s inflation-proof.\\n\\n6\\n\\nIt\\u2019s Way Easier to Get Into Crypto Than You Thought\\n\\nJust in case you thought you need a PhD in programming, or maybe in finance to get into crypto \\u2014 we\\u2019ll tell you now. You don\\u2019t. A smartphone with internet access will do nicely. In fact, crypto is way easier to get into than more traditional investments.\\n\\nFirst, because it\\u2019s got high liquidity \\u2014 that you can buy and sell it easily and quickly. Second, there isn\\u2019t a high threshold to getting into it. For stocks and bonds, usually you need to put a large sum of money, and you can\\u2019t just put down 100 bucks. With crypto, you can.\\n\\nBetter still, there are no institutions, no paperwork \\u2014 just get an account, get a wallet, track your assets. And it\\u2019s pseudonymous \\u2014 you don\\u2019t have to give any documents, or even your name.\\n\\nBut we realize, there\\u2019s still a lot of confusion, and not many people understand how this space works, and how to take advantage of it. That\\u2019s why we decided to create the best course out there, to guide you step by step through everything we\\u2019ve learned about Bitcoin and Blockchain \\u2014 from scratch.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s called Bitcoin Essentials. You\\u2019ll learn how the technology works, how to use it, how to buy bitcoin safely, and how to store it. Just to go alux.com/bitcoin [ http://alux.com/bitcoin ]. If you want to be part of this new revolution in technology and wealth, this is something you really don\\u2019t want to miss out on.\\n\\n7\\n\\nNo One Controls Your Money\\n\\nSo if regular money is controlled by governments and banks \\u2014 who does control crypto? Well, the beauty of crypto is that it\\u2019s controlled by nobody \\u2014 and everybody \\u2014 at the same time.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s take Bitcoin. The code is stored in thousands of nodes \\u2014 that means the computers of tens of thousands people who voluntarily run Bitcoin software on their computers. There\\u2019s no central authority or mastermind behind it. All users effectively retain control. And it\\u2019s in everyone\\u2019s interests to keep the network active and healthy.\\n\\nAnd running it this way has all kinds of advantages over banks. Like, banks are only open business hours of the country they\\u2019re based in. Blockchain functions non-stop. And banks payments can take up to 48 hours to clear \\u2014 Bitcoin transactions take between 15 minutes and an hour.\\n\\n8\\n\\nThe Best Security on the Market\\n\\nSo, if there\\u2019s no big powerful institution monitoring it, is it safe? The answer is a definite yes. It\\u2019s got the best security out there. And that\\u2019s down to the way information is stored.\\n\\nAny time a transaction takes place, and digital money gets handed over to a new user, that gets recorded permanently. And it can\\u2019t be erased. Even after it\\u2019s changed hands again. And remember we said that the data is stored by tens of thousands users? Unlike a bank, which has one central database.\\n\\nIf one user has an error \\u2014 or if anyone tries to tamper with information \\u2014 the other tens of thousands will cross-reference each other and correct it. And the bigger the network \\u2014 the more secure. And in the case of Bitcoin \\u2014 that\\u2019s big. And you can count on it being secure.\\n\\n9\\n\\nThe Lowest Fees by Far\\n\\nFor any kind of investment you make, there are going to be fees. Fees for making buying, selling and even storing the investment. And this is also true of crypto. But the difference is that with crypto, fees that are determined by users. And that means it\\u2019s in their interest to keep them low. Much lower than the ones you\\u2019ll be charged by stockbrokers to invest in stocks or bonds.\\n\\nAnd the same goes for making transfers \\u2014 especially international ones. Make a transfer through a bank, and you\\u2019re going to get slapped by a high fee. But with crypto, there are no institutions making a profit from these money transfers, which is a huge advantage for people doing business. And another reason why the adoption rate of crypto is going to keep going up.\\n\\n10\\n\\nBlockchain Is Here to Stay\\n\\nWhat you have to understand about blockchain, is that Bitcoin and other crypto, are built on Blockchain in the same way Facebook or Google are built on top of the internet. It\\u2019s what makes crypto possible \\u2014 but there\\u2019s more to blockchain than crypto.\\n\\nWe think that crypto is proof enough that blockchain is going to become more important. But just in case you needed more \\u2014 let\\u2019s just look at all the other things blockchain is being used for.\\n\\nBig business is using it to record data. Companies like Pfizer, Walmart, Siemens, Unilever use it to keep data which is too complex for a spreadsheet to record. Healthcare providers use it to store their patients\\u2019 medical records safely. And there\\u2019s potential for it to grow in records of property ownership. And in elections, to keep track of votes and take away the need for recounts. Yep, that one would have come in handy in 2020.\\n\\n11\\n\\nHigh Returns if Done Right\\n\\nWe\\u2019ve already told you how much Bitcoin\\u2019s gone up \\u2014 and how the long-term trend is bound to continue upwards. So we won\\u2019t repeat ourselves. But we will take the chance to tell you about a few other cryptocurrencies.\\n\\nIn 2020, even with the pandemic in full swing, lots of crypto have seen big gains. The world\\u2019s second largest crypto, Ethereum started the year at $145, and is now at $600. And some are tipping it to become as popular as Bitcoin.\\n\\nAnd Ripple started the year at just over 20 cents and is now around 65 cents. And may others are headed in the same direction. Further proof, that now\\u2019s the time to get in the door, if you haven\\u2019t already.\\n\\n12\\n\\nIt\\u2019s in Limited Supply \\u2014 and Can\\u2019t Suffer From Inflation\\n\\nRemember we talked about the way conventional currencies lose their value because of inflation? There\\u2019s a simple reason why crypto doesn\\u2019t.\\n\\nThe supply is capped. This is written into the source code, which states that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin produced.\\n\\nCurrently, 18.5 million Bitcoins have been mined. Quick explanation \\u2014 mining means when advanced computers crack complex math problems and unlock the Bitcoins stored in the code.\\n\\nAnd even if new Bitcoins are still getting mined, there\\u2019s a limit on this. Unlike with traditional money, when banks decide print it by the truckload. With Bitcoin, the number of new coins released slows down every four years, meaning the supply is limited. And that\\u2019s the reason Bitcoin won\\u2019t suffer from inflation.\\n\\n13\\n\\nThe Price Is Dictated by the Free Market, No Government Can Touch It\\n\\nWith traditional money, governments have lots of options for manipulating its value. We already mentioned printing new money. As well as that, they set interest rates \\u2014 the price of borrowing government money, which has ripple effect on the rest of the economy.\\n\\nBut with crypto, none of this is set by a government. Instead everything\\u2019s controlled by the free market \\u2014 or how much people are willing to buy or sell it for. And besides that, governments can\\u2019t freeze crypto accounts, or look at records of who has how much in crypto accounts. That\\u2019s because, unlike regular bank accounts, crypto accounts are pseudonymous. That means the holder doesn\\u2019t disclose their true name or identity.\\n\\n14\\n\\nIt\\u2019s at an Early Stage and Already Disrupting Markets\\n\\nSince Bitcoin was created in 2009, meaning that crypto\\u2019s already over 10 years old. But now\\u2019s the time it\\u2019s\\u2019 really taking off \\u2014 and the growth it\\u2019s\\u2019 going to see over the next decades is likely to be a whole load more exciting than what we\\u2019ve seen up until now. You could say, the stage we\\u2019re at now is like the internet in the 90s.\\n\\nIn fact, if you look at the numbers of people who\\u2019ve adopted cryptocurrencies over the last decade, it looks a lot like the adoption of the internet back in the 90s. Deutsche Bank have pointed out this similarity \\u2014 and they predict that adoption rates are going to keep on at the same rate as the internet after the 90s. In other words, it\\u2019s going to keep on going up \\u2014 in a spectacular way.\\n\\nAnd just like the internet\\u2019s disrupted literally everything over the last twenty years \\u2014 we\\u2019re probably looking at blockchain doing the same over the coming decades.\\n\\n15\\n\\nBig Business Is Taking It Seriously\\n\\nLook at the list of companies that already accept payment in Bitcoin. Microsoft. AT&T. McDonalds, KFC and Subway. Virgin Galactic. CheapAir. Gyft. 4Chan. Norwegian Air. Twitch. Sports clubs like the Dallas Mavericks, Miami Dolphins or Portuguese soccer club Benfica. And Wikipedia accepts donations in Bitcoin.\\n\\nTrue, other companies are still reluctant to allow payments in it \\u2014 because, it\\u2019s still volatile. But that\\u2019s bound to even out over time, and more and more big business will accept Bitcoin \\u2014 and other crypto \\u2014 as payment.\\n\\nAnd remember how we mentioned that Twitter\\u2019s Jack Dorsey\\u2019s talked about it being the future of money? Well, he\\u2019s put his money where his mouth is, and his payments company Square has invested $50 million in Bitcoin."}, {"upvote": 212, "content": "Cryptocurrencies have performed debatably in 2018, yet are continuing to attract new investors in 2019.\\n\\nHowever, most beginners have difficulties finding the next cryptocurrency to invest in 2019. We\\u2019ve all been there, so don\\u2019t worry! I understand how confusing it is when you first begin looking for new cryptocurrency investments. And that\\u2019s why I\\u2019m here to help.\\n\\nSo, are you also looking for the next cryptocurrencies to invest in 2019? Do you find yourself wondering \\u201cShould I be investing in Bitcoin?\\u201d or \\u201cShould I be in investing in Ethereum?\\u201d\\n\\nPeople should know by now that there are other ways of making more on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency. example , investing on platforms like coinstation (www.coinstation.tech) where you get 100% ROI on invested cryptocurrency after 7days. With that, you cant lose on cryptocurrency. Thank me later\\n\\nWell, wonder no longer! I\\u2019m here to answer all your questions. By the end of this guide, you\\u2019ll know how to find cryptocurrencies to invest in 2019.\\n\\nBut first, let\\u2019s talk you through the recent growth of cryptocurrencies.\\n\\nCryptocurrency Market So Far\\n\\nThe first cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was invented back in 2009. That was just the beginning though, and nobody really knew about Bitcoin until 2013. However, since 2013 the cryptocurrency market has seen huge growth \\u2014 growth that has been hard to ignore. Such growth and market size can be compared to some of the very traditional retail markets, for example, multibillion mattress market (you didn\\u2019t think of it, did you?). This market has experienced a vast growth of such skyrocketing mattress companies as casper or nectar, very similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum rising in the digital world. There are now more than 1500 different cryptocurrencies, all created in less than 5 years.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s clear that 2017 was the year crypto really blew up. The market cap of cryptocurrencies grew by 4000%! The market cap of all cryptocurrencies was around $21 billion in March 2017, whereas it is now over $454 billion. That\\u2019s huge!\\n\\nMarket cap: The total price of all coins added together.\\n\\nThe cryptocurrency market isn\\u2019t just about Bitcoin anymore. There are other cryptocurrencies that have entered the space, such as Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple. All of these have performed incredibly well over the last year.\\n\\nThe following chart from CoinMarketCap shows the growth of cryptocurrencies over the years.\\n\\nThere are a lot of things being said about the future of cryptocurrencies. Some people believe that the cryptocurrency phase won\\u2019t last long, while others think they\\u2019re going to be around forever.\\n\\nIt is difficult to predict the future of cryptocurrencies, but what I do know is that the popularity of cryptocurrencies is only increasing. One of the reasons why cryptocurrencies are becoming more popular is because of blockchain technology, which is the main technology behind all cryptocurrencies.\\n\\nBlockchain technology is the next big thing \\u2013 it is secure, trustless technology that was first used by Bitcoin. You can\\u2019t learn how to invest in blockchain, though. Instead, you can learn how to invest in the cryptocurrencies that use blockchain (which is all of them!)\\n\\nAre you ready to find out about the next cryptocurrency to invest in 2019? Well, let\\u2019s get started.\\n\\nSo, what are the Best Cryptocurrencies to Invest 2019\\n\\nBest Cryptocurrency to Invest 2019: Bitcoin (BTC)\\n\\nIf somehow, you\\u2019ve only heard of one cryptocurrency, it\\u2019s probably Bitcoin. It is the biggest cryptocurrency \\u2014 it currently has a 40%i share in the total cryptocurrency market cap! It is the oldest cryptocurrency and it still dominates in the market. So, if Bitcoin continues to increase as it did in 2017, then investing in Bitcoin might be a good idea for 2019.\\n\\nThe price of Bitcoin changes a lot every day and has seen many highs and lows over the last few years. Take a look at the following chart and you will see just how much the price changes.\\n\\nThe price of 1 Bitcoin has gone from around $76 (07.09.13) to as high as $20,000 in December 2017. But then after Bitcoin reached its highest point in December, the price of Bitcoin dropped to around $6000 in February 2018, and has been dropping even further ever since. It\\u2019s crazy!\\n\\nWith the price changing so much in such a short space of time, how do you decide what the best time is for investing in Bitcoin?\\n\\nWell, we can try to find the answers by looking at some important past events \\u2014 when the price went up or down by a large amount.\\n\\n * One major event was when Bitcoin split into two cryptocurrencies \\u2014 Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. This happened August 1st Investors who knew about this invested their money before the split and made huge profits, almost doubling their investment!\\n * The price of Bitcoin dropped to around $10,000 in January 2018, almost half of the $20,000 it was worth in December 2017. Many investors became worried at this point and started selling their Bitcoin. This caused the price to fall to around $6,000 in February 2018.\\nBitcoin Investing\\n\\nIf you want to invest in Bitcoin then you need to stay up to date with the latest news and trends around Bitcoin. When news is released about a new technical improvement, you might want to think about buying Bitcoin. If there is a huge fall in price of Bitcoin, then that too might be a good time to buy Bitcoin because you can buy it a low price.\\n\\nIf you have already decided to invest in cryptocurrencies, then it might be a good idea to start by investing in Bitcoin. Even though you have missed the first major opportunity to invest, investing in Bitcoin could still be a good idea.\\n\\nIt all depends on whether you believe in the future of Bitcoin. If you believe in it, you should think about investing in it. If you don\\u2019t, then I recommend that you stay away from it. It\\u2019s the same with any investment!\\n\\nBest Cryptocurrency to Invest 2019: Ethereum (ETH)\\n\\nTowards the end of last year, the price of Ethereum was slightly higher than $720, with a total market cap of around $70 billion. At the beginning of 2018, Ethereum climbed and reached its highest price of $1423 on January 4. At this time, the total market cap for Ethereum was at $138 billion!\\n\\nEthereum grew by about 3000% in the year 2017 and became the second largest cryptocurrency, placing second behind Bitcoin.\\n\\nAre you asking yourself, \\u201cShould I invest in Ethereum?\\u201d or \\u201cIs the price of Ethereum already at its peak?\\u201d. Well, the truth is, nobody knows! However, the following information should help you decide whether investing in Ethereum is a good option for you.\\n\\nThe chart below shows how Ethereum has grown over the last few years.\\n\\nBelow are the key events that have most affected the price of Ethereum in the past:\\n\\n * Ethereum received an investment of around $150 million in May 2016. As a result, its price went up from $1 in January 2016 to around $14.80 in May 2016.\\n * However, On June 18th, 2016, members of the Ethereum community found out that Ethereum had been hacked. Around $60 million worth of Ether (Ethereum\\u2019s currency) was stolen due to a flaw in a wallet. This caused the Ethereum price to drop from the high of $21.52 on 17th June 2016, to $9.96 on the 18th June 2016.\\nUnlike Bitcoin, Ethereum is not just a digital currency. It is a more advanced blockchain project. This is because Ethereum offers something special \\u2014 by using Ethereum\\u2019s platform, developers can build their own cryptocurrencies.\\n\\nImagine that you would like to build a blockchain-based solution for managing the supply chain of your business. Well, thanks to Ethereum, you don\\u2019t need to start from the beginning. Instead, you can just build an application on Ethereum\\u2019s blockchain. Ethereum makes it much easier for new blockchain projects to launch.\\n\\nSo, is Ethereum your next cryptocurrency to invest in 2019?\\n\\nI recommend that you think about adding Ethereum to your list, as I think it could be one of the best cryptocurrency to invest 2019.\\n\\nJulian Hosp, a blockchain expert, said that the market cap of Ethereum could rise to $200 billion by the end of 2019. If Hosp\\u2019s prediction is correct, the price of Ethereum will reach up to $2000. Hosp\\u2019s reason behind the prediction is based mostly on the ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) that decided to use the Ethereum blockchain in 2018 & 2019.\\n\\nEthereum also plans to improve their technology a lot this year, with new protocols almost ready to go. So, watch out for Ethereum!\\n\\nBest Cryptocurrency to Invest 2019: Ripple (XRP)\\n\\nRipple, also known as XRP, was one of the best performing cryptocurrencies in 2017 with growth of around 36,000%! Yes, you read that right. It grew from almost $0 at the beginning of 2017 and reached $2.4 in December 2017 \\u2014 as you can see in the following chart.\\n\\nLike all other cryptocurrencies, the price of Ripple has also decreased in 2018 \\u2014 it is currently set at $0.36.\\n\\nI know what you\\u2019re thinking \\u2014 you missed a great opportunity by not investing Ripple in early 2017. While that\\u2019s true, Ripple could still be a good option to consider as your next cryptocurrency to invest in 2019.\\n\\nEven though the price of one XRP is a lot lower than the price of one Bitcoin, XRP is still the third largest cryptocurrency by market cap. In May 2018, it had a total market cap of around $35 billion.\\n\\nSo, what is it about Ripple that has made it so popular for investors?\\n\\nThe main reason for Ripple\\u2019s popularity is that it is not just a digital currency, but also a payment system. Ripple uses blockchain technology to make international payments securer and faster.\\n\\nIf you tried to make an international bank payment today, it would take around 2-10 days for the transaction to process. The same payment, when done using Ripple, takes a few seconds. How awesome is that!\\n\\nBut there\\u2019s more good news \\u2013 many large financial institutions like American Express, JP Morgan and Santander are already using Ripple\\u2019s technology. Also, Ripple has been working with the Saudi Arabia Central Bank, China\\u2019s LianLian International and other banks from around the world.\\n\\nSo, if you\\u2019re wondering how to invest in blockchain, then Ripple might be the best answer.\\n\\nBased on what I just explained, Ripple\\u2019s future in financial industry could be a good one. You should watch out for Ripple and learn more about their partnerships. Look out for newpartnerships too \\u2014 if Ripple signs a contract with another large bank, then it could increase the price of XRP.\\n\\nThe investors, who understood the services that are offered by Ripple, have made a lot of money. After a fantastic 2017, Ripple could just be the best cryptocurrency to invest 2019.\\n\\nNote: Now might be a good time to invest in Ripple, as its price has dropped 70% lower than it\\u2019s all-time high of $3.4 in January 2017.\\n\\nBest Cryptocurrency to Invest 2019: Litecoin (LTC)\\n\\nOur list of what is the best cryptocurrency to invest 2019 cannot be complete without Litecoin. Just like Ripple, Litecoin showed great performance in 2017 with a growth of almost 8000%.\\n\\nThe price of Litecoin grew from around $4 at the beginning of 2017 to a high of $358 in December 2017. However, just like most cryptocurrencies, Litecoin also followed the price trend and dropped to $110 on February 2018.\\n\\nTake a look at Litecoin\\u2019s price chart below \\u2014 you can see the quick rise in the price of Litecoin at the beginning of 2018. The price of both Litecoin and Bitcoin have followed a similar trend over the last year.\\n\\nLitecoin is the 5th largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of around $11 billion. Litecoin continues to interest investors because of its close connection to Bitcoin. Providing a good reason for Litecoin to be on our list for the next cryptocurrency to invest in 2019.\\n\\nLitecoin was created in 2011 to improve upon Bitcoin\\u2019s technology. Litecoin completes a transaction 4 times faster than Bitcoin. However, unlike Bitcoin, the maximum number of Litecoin is capped at 84 million \\u2014 4 times more than the coin supply of Bitcoin (21 million).\\n\\nLitecoin was the first cryptocurrency to perform a lighning network transaction in May 2017. Using the Lightning Network, 0.00000001 Litecoin was transferred from Zurich to San Francisco in under one second! Once Litecoin starts using the Lightning Network, it could increase the price of the Litecoin!\\n\\nLightning Network: A new technology which increases the speed of transactions on the blockchain network.\\n\\nInvestment Strategies: Let\\u2019s Make Something Clear\\n\\nHow do investors make decisions they want to invest in real estate or stocks? Do they start making investments the moment they think about it? My guess is that the answer to that question is \\u2013 no!\\n\\nBefore you invest in anything, you need a clear understanding of what your investment goals are and how you will achieve them. You want a good idea of how long you are prepared to keep your investment open, and what amount of profit you are happy to take.\\n\\nYou should have the same mindset with cryptocurrency investments. Before you decide what the next cryptocurrency to invest in 2019 is for you, let\\u2019s discuss the two main types of investment strategies for cryptocurrencies.\\n\\nLong-term Cryptocurrency Investment\\n\\nA long-term investment is one where you expect a cryptocurrency to perform better over a longer period of time. Simple! Normally, the minimum time for long-term investment is 6 months to 1 year. Although, some people plan to hold onto their investments for 5-10+ years. It\\u2019s up to you how you choose to invest; you can either make your full investment in one go, or you can invest at different times.\\n\\nLong-term Investment Strategy\\n\\nOnce again, before investing any amount, you must have a clear idea of what your investment goals are:\\n\\n * Will you sell the cryptocurrency after a certain amount of time or will you sell it when it reaches a certain price?\\n * Will you sell off your investment at once or will you sell parts of it at different times?\\n * On what occasion would you sell the long-term investment in the short term? For example, if new laws come into place that could affect the long-term price of your investment, you might consider selling it sooner.\\nNext, you should do some research to decide which cryptocurrencies are best as long-term investments. I recommend that you check for the following:\\n\\n * Is their technology better than their competitors?\\n * Do they have a strong team of founders and developers?\\n * How good is their roadmap/plan?\\n * Are they solving any real-world problems?\\nIf you really believe in the cryptocurrency you invest in, you should learn to hold on to your investment even when the prices drop. If you \\u2018panic sell\\u2019, then you could lose money and regret selling.\\n\\nReasons For Making Long-Term Investments\\n\\n * Long-term investing makes your life easier as you don\\u2019t need to watch the market all the time\\n * You believe that some cryptocurrencies will give a better return in the long-term\\n * You truly believe in the future of the cryptocurrency\\nShort-Term Cryptocurrency Investment\\n\\nShort-term investments are made over shorter time periods in the hope of making quick profits. So, just how short is a short-term investment?\\n\\nShort-term investments can take seconds, minutes, days or even a few months.\\n\\nHow Do Short-Term Investments Work?\\n\\nJust like long-term investing, you need to have clear goals for your investment. You need to be asking yourself:\\n\\n * What profit are you expecting to make from this investment? This will give you an idea of the price at which you should buy/sell the cryptocurrency.\\n * How much of a loss will you accept? This will help you control your losses if the price of cryptocurrency suddenly drops.\\n * Do you have time to study and follow the crypto market and the news?\\n * Can you make technical analyses of the crypto market? If not, then you should learn before investing.\\n * Will your short-term strategy give you higher returns than a long-term strategy?\\nYou need to find out which is the best cryptocurrency to invest 2019 for short-term. Cryptocurrencies that have the following are good options for short-term investments:\\n\\n * Low market cap\\n * High trading volume \\u2014 lots of people are buying and selling it every minute\\n * Are currently trending on the news and on social media\\n * Have an ICO or have just finished their ICO \\u2014 try to get them at a low price\\nWhile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum can also be traded in the short-term, you should think about investing in the newer cryptocurrencies. Investors have made huge profits in past with short-term investments \\u2013 including some of the major, but newest cryptocurrency investments like NEO, Stellar, IOTA and NEM.\\n\\nThe main advantage to short-term investments is that you can make a lot of money in a short amount of time \\u2014 they have made a lot of people rich quickly. However, they still have their disadvantages.\\n\\nSo, what are they?\\n\\n * They take up a lot of time and effort as you need to watch the market prices constantly\\n * It is a riskier investment and can result in greater losses because of how much the price changes in a short time\\n * It can be very stressful and emotional\\nIt\\u2019s difficult to say which is the better option of the two investment strategies. It all depends on your goals and experience in the cryptocurrency market.\\n\\nIf you really believe in a project, then I recommend that you invest for the long term. However, if a project is new and is generating a lot of attention, then short-term trading could be the better option.\\n\\nFinal Words\\n\\nWhile cryptocurrencies can give you huge profits, you must be prepared for one more thing \\u2014 to lose money. Remember, your predictions won\\u2019t always be right! Nobody truly knows what is going to happen to the price of a cryptocurrency, or any other investment.\\n\\nDo you know what most of the expert cryptocurrency investors say? You should only invest money that you are not afraid to lose. It\\u2019s great advice, so always remember it!"}, {"upvote": 39, "content": "In the wake of bitcoin's price explosion and as more digital currencies flood the market, investors are looking for the next digital currency to get rich off of. The question is, how does one go about finding a cryptocurrency which will take off in the future?\\n\\nInvesting in cryptocurrency in general is a good business if you are on the right path and with the right platform. After so many failed attempt on getting the right platform, I came across CryptohodlerFx Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www.cryptohodlerfx,com) where i get 40% of every investment i made with cryptocurrency every 10 days. It looks to good to be true until i gave it a try and trust me it has been a smooth ride all the way. Don\\u2019t give up on cryptocurrency and join the platform. Trust me, you won\\u2019t care about the price fluctuation anymore. Thank me Later.\\n\\nNote: This is not in any case of me trying to lure you into anything for my own personal financial gain, i am just innocently sharing with you what works for me. You can also make a research on what works for you too.\\n\\nPrice Is Crucial\\n\\nOne element to keep in mind when scanning for the next superstar is the price of the token. For the average investor who doesn't have a great deal of money to put into the cryptocurrency space, low-priced currencies may offer the best bang for your buck.\\n\\nImagine a potential investment of $5,000: at today's prices, that money could buy less than half of one bitcoin, over 25 litecoin, or thousands of coins from one or more currencies priced below $1 each. The ability to diversify with low-priced coins should not be overlooked.\\n\\nProspects for Adoption\\n\\nHeading into 2018, ripple made huge growth. While XRP has declined somewhat since the start of the new year, it nonetheless has strong potential for adoption outside of the cryptocurrency speculation world. The reason for this has to do with the system of settlement that ripple's underlying technology promises to central banks and other financial institutions.\\n\\nIf you're able to identify a cryptocurrency which has an edge over others (and which therefore may be more likely to be widely adopted), this may be a good investment.\\n\\nSupply Is a Factor\\n\\nMost cryptocurrencies have a pre-determined maximum supply. When that maximum is reached, typically through mining efforts, no new tokens will be produced.\\n\\nIf interest maintains while the supply is fixed, the price could go up. Be sure to consider the total supply and the current circulation of any cryptocurrency before you invest.\\n\\nPrice and Volume\\n\\nUp-to-date information about cryptocurrency trading is easily available online. Those digital currencies with increasing price and volume of trades are likely to be those that have momentum going forward. Of course, there is no guarantee that this momentum will maintain, but it is nonetheless a useful way of seeing which digital currencies have the most investor interest for the time being."}, {"upvote": 144, "content": "Firstly, read more about cryptocurrencies and how they work, then measure you risk taking level.

Investing in cryptocurrencies can be an intriguing prospect for a portion of your portfolio, but you should make sure to diversify your investments with other holdings. Aside buying and holding cryptocurrency for potential gains which is a huge advantage of the benefits derived from cryptocurrency,as a cryptocurrency trade deciding on which crypto coin to choose from can be really difficult, I also recommend that you invest in service companies such as the Zippercoin(www.zippercoin.tech)company, a cryptocurrency investment company that gives return on investments made in days by capitalizing on the volatility of the crypto market to generate profits giving you better chance in the cryptocurrency market.A good financial advisor can advise you on a good asset allocation,most will even invest your money for you. However, the process is still slightly more complex than acquiring a more traditional currency. If you\\u2019re interested in purchasing Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, here\\u2019s what you should know.\\n\\nWhat is Cryptocurrency?\\n\\nThere are thousands of different cryptocurrencies available today, and it can be tricky to nail them all down with a single definition. Broadly speaking, though, a cryptocurrency is a digital currency that is encrypted and often decentralized. Bitcoin,the first and most recognizable cryptocurrency by far, is based on blockchain technology,a permanent decentralized ledger system.\\n\\nWhile Bitcoin is the most popular and most valuable cryptocurrency out there, it\\u2019s led to the creation of thousands of alternatives, or altcoins. There are all different kinds of altcoins. Some are close variations of Bitcoin, like Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin Diamond. Others focus on privacy, like Monero and ZCash. Some are named after Greek Gods (Apollo Currency), reptiles (Komodo) or even internet memes (Dogecoin). It\\u2019s a weird, wild world.\\n\\nMost people only have interest in holding on to Bitcoin or another popular currency, Ethereum. Still, there are some speculators who attempt to buy low and sell high on more obscure cryptocurrencies. The hope is to get rich quick by getting in early on the next Bitcoin.\\n\\nRegardless of what currency you invest in, the common denominator is volatility. Any cryptocurrency has value only as long as people perceive it to have value. While this is technically true of any currency, it\\u2019s more pertinent with cryptocurrencies because they aren\\u2019t backed by a government or a precious metal(like gold)as most currencies are. This makes it a much riskier investment, as many investors and speculators have learned the hard way.\\n\\nHow to Invest in Cryptocurrency\\n\\nIn simple terms, you need a place to buy it and a place to put it. The most popular place to purchase cryptocurrency are cryptocurrency exchanges.\\n\\nThere are several different exchanges to choose from, with the most popular being Coinbase, GDAx and Bitfinex. These exchanges allow you purchase currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum with a debit card. With most popular currencies, including Bitcoin, you can buy fractions of a coin, so you don\\u2019t need to invest thousands of dollars to get in the game.\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re interested in purchasing altcoins, odds are you\\u2019ll need some Bitcoin or Ethereum to make that purchase. As a general rule, you can\\u2019t buy altcoins with fiat currency (that\\u2019s how crypto enthusiasts refer to paper money, like dollars or euros). But that may change in the future.\\n\\nExchanges make money by charging fees for conducting transactions, but there are other websites you can visit to interact directly with other users who are looking to sell cryptocurrencies. LocalBitcoins is one popular example. The process will likely be more drawn out than with an exchange, and there is the added risk of dealing directly with a stranger whose currency you can\\u2019t verify. If you\\u2019re new to cryptocurrency, you\\u2019ll likely want to use an exchange.\\n\\nOne other option that\\u2019s becoming more prevalent is the Bitcoin ATM. There are more than 4,000 cryptocurrency ATM locations in 76 countries today. You can use them to purchase Bitcoin and send it to your wallet.\\n\\nShould You Invest in Cryptocurrency?\\n\\nThe cryptocurrency fervor is undoubtedly more subdued than it was in, say, 2017. The price of Bitcoin has fallen precipitously from its all-time peak of more than $17,000 (to about $3,500 as of early 2019). If the cryptocurrency market had to be described in just one word, it would be volatile.\\n\\nSo like any other investment, you should weigh the potential gains against your own risk tolerance. If you tend to be more risk-averse with your investments and you\\u2019re looking to build wealth over decades, cryptocurrencies probably aren\\u2019t for you. No one can accurately predict what will happen to the market for cryptocurrencies. Yes, that\\u2019s technically true for all investments. But other markets \\u2013 say, the stock market \\u2013 grow much more consistently, with significantly less volatility. Indeed, it may be misleading to even call it \\u201cinvesting\\u201d to buy Bitcoin. It would be more accurate to refer to it as speculation.\\n\\nStill, if you\\u2019re willing to take a risk and you believe the current Bitcoin price is the low point before an upswing, then by all means give it a try. Bitcoin has now been around for 10 years \\u2014 longer than many expected it would last. A future with Bitcoin as some sort of worldwide reserve currency seems increasingly unlikely day by day. But it\\u2019s reasonable to expect that it will retain some value for the foreseeable future. The same can\\u2019t be said for some of the more obscure altcoins, though.\\n\\nThe most important thing, as with any potential investment, is to have a clear idea of the risks you\\u2019re taking. You shouldn\\u2019t put yourself in a situation where your financial health is dependent on the success of cryptocurrencies. However, if you\\u2019re well aware of the risks and you want to give it a shot anyway, you may get lucky.\\n\\nThanks for reading."}, {"upvote": 74, "content": "Cryptocurrency investment is purchasing a particular cryptocurrency when the price is low and sell when the prices goes high.

The ability to recover funds after a rugpull is still very much something CEXs ought to tackle though I believe Mexc is really trying their best on that regard and I\\u2019ll give you two instances for this. During the saga of $DMA rugpull, the exchange sprung into action to compensate users for their losses.

Third reason is, I\\u2019m yet to see any exchange include this very vital feature of \\u201cAsset Owner Exchange\\u201d.

Another reason is that some investors are concerned about the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies, which has been more uncertain in recent months.

Now the question is \\u201cWhy the heck it the price going up but the RSI falling down?\\u201d.\\n\\nWell this is called Divergence. The real reason that this divergence showed up here is that the big (smart) money pulled out of the market at point 1 (Either all of the big smart money or a big chunk of it).

Now that the big whales are out, the small fish came swimming and put their money in so the price goes up to point 2 but there\\u2019s a difference between price reaching point 1 and price reaching point 2. The difference is that for example 10 rich whales invested 10 billion dollars in bitcoin so it reached point 1, then they pulled out their money and the small fish came to play so 100,000 normal people invested 10 billion in bitcoin and it rose again to point 2. Do you see the difference? 10 rich smart whales don\\u2019t panic, they know what they\\u2019re doing, but 100,000 average traders who are looking to make a quick buck will panic with the first sign of danger. so from point 1 to point 2 those big whales pulled out of the market so slow and subtle that those fish didn\\u2019t suspect a thing. They kept buying the overpriced bitcoin and the whales were happy to sell at the top. One red candle shows up, the fish panic and sell like crazy and the rest is history.\\n\\nThat divergence is the real reason why the prices dropped but there\\u2019s no reason to panic. Heavy drops are good for the market. The funny part is that now while the fish are panicking and selling their valuable assets those whales would enter again and buy the cheap coins to get ready for the $100k bitcoin (remember bitcoin dropped from $20k to $3200 to get ready for the $40k, $50k and $60k."}, {"upvote": 84, "content": "The main reason is there\\u2019s no reason for 99.9% of cryptocurrencies to succeed.\\n\\nWhat\\u2019s the value add?

Do your research and don't buy more than you can afford to lose.\\n\\nThere are several ways to make money with cryptocurrencies without spending time or being an investment expert. It is enough to know what are the market options that provide passive income and choose the one that best suits personal preferences.\\n\\nPassive income is income that is obtained regularly without devoting time, work, effort, and attention. That is, they are produced by themselves through an investment. It consists of putting money to work instead of stagnating savings. In this way, they can be increased.\\n\\nFor this reason, many people take advantage of this possibility to generate profits while carrying out other activities in their lives. In the cryptocurrency market, there is a wide variety of investment options that generate passive income for both experts and beginners.\\n\\nAlthough it should be noted that no investment is risk-free. Therefore, it is essential to thoroughly investigate the operation and possible results of any method before carrying it out.\\n\\n1) Trade without trading:\\n\\nOne of the best-known ways to make money with cryptocurrencies is trading. But this technique is unworkable for those who don't have the time or knowledge, as it requires looking at the market 24/7 and understanding its indicators. That is why many platforms have tools to perform this activity automatically.\\n\\nTrading is an activity that allows you to earn money by speculating on the value of different assets. On more established exchanges, this is something that can be automated to do itself completely on its own. You just have to choose which cryptocurrencies you want and define at what price you are willing to buy and sell them to make a profit with the price difference.\\n\\nIn this way, a bot or \\u201crobot\\u201d will do the work for you generating passive income, even while you are sleeping. Each application calls this tool differently, but you can easily find it if you investigate its settings.\\n\\n2) Lend your cryptocurrencies for profit:\\n\\nA simple option to earn money with cryptocurrencies without doing anything is to be a lender. Different exchanges allow anyone to give peer-to-peer loans in exchange for receiving interest. In this way, passive income is obtained during the duration of the credit.\\n\\nIf the applicant fails to pay it, the borrowed amount will be reincorporated in the same way. This is because the sender must deposit an amount greater than the amount he will receive as collateral. In this way, the lender ensures that he will have his money back along with interest.\\n\\nAnother way to \\\"lend\\\" money is to stake through proof-of-stake, an activity that allows you to lock up your cryptocurrencies to contribute to the mining process. In exchange for this, you can get rewards. For example, I regularly use the Staking Vaults feature of the Divi Project Smart Wallet, because it is extremely easy to use and allows you to get up to +23% APY. About this project, there is a lot of interesting information in its Divi Quora Space [ https://divi.quora.com/ ]\\n\\nYou don't have to be a mining expert to take advantage of this investment technique. It is only important to know the terms and conditions of your process. The blocking time is predefined before starting, either flexible or for a certain fixed term. And it can be done with different cryptocurrencies and variable amounts, depending on the exchange.\\n\\n3) Choose an investment carefully that you like:\\n\\nIn short, earning money with cryptocurrencies doing practically nothing is a possible reality. It just depends on taking action. There is a wide variety of investment techniques that allow you to generate passive income and there is no one better than another. The ideal will depend on the possibilities and personal preferences of each person.\\n\\nTo find out which one is best for you, it is essential to thoroughly investigate everything about investing with cryptocurrencies that catches your attention. In this way, you will be able to choose the one that is right for you safely and not has surprises later or encounter unwanted situations.\\n\\n4) Take advantage of bonuses from your cryptocurrency exchange:\\n\\nSome exchanges provide significant trading fee discounts when using their tokens. That is why it is advisable to find out how their bonuses work to take advantage of them at your convenience. In turn, these assets increase in value if their demand grows, so you can generate passive income.\\n\\nAnother way to earn money without doing practically anything is to take advantage of the affiliate plan offered by the exchange you use. You can find a special link or code in its settings that will allow you to send each person you recommend the app to. In this way, every time someone registers on the platform with your reference, you can get compensation as a thank you.

Essentially, crypto will be the only money or at least the only money that will matter. Sounds crazy right? But what would make someone think that way?\\n\\nThe Bitcoiner Mind\\n\\nThe Bitcoin whitepaper was released shortly after the 2008 Recession. The general public was rightfully furious that banks received bailouts and the bailouts included bonus money and golden parachutes for the people directly responsible for the financial meltdown. Was Bitcoin released because of the Recession or was the Recession just a golden opportunity? We will never know but it is evident that Satoshi Nakamoto (Bitcoin\\u2019s anonymous developer) had the big banks in mind when he developed Bitcoin.\\n\\nBitcoin is decentralized and has no Bitcoin corporation or government in charge of it. It is a protest against the current global financial system that:\\n\\n1. The Central bank prints out money and loans it to governments and big banks at cheap interest rates.\\n2. The governments enforce the money by making it legal tender and demanding taxes in it.\\n3. Even though government\\u2019s have access to cheap money from their central bank and taxes from their people they still go into loads of debt.\\n4. So the government\\u2019s make sure that the Central banks maintain inflation to keep their debts from getting out of control. It\\u2019s a hidden tax on an already taxed population.\\n5. But government debts seem to grow anyway\\u2026 and taxes and inflation continue to rise.\\n6. The banks receive money from the Central bank at cheap interest rates and then charge higher interest rates to their customers for all sorts of different loans. They can even make new money by creating new loans.\\n7. The banks are businesses with access to cheap money and charge the consumers consistent fees and higher interest rates\\u2026 and they still need bailouts.\\nSomething is rotten.\\n\\nAnd now many currencies around the world are experiencing negative interest rates and have rising inflation rates. The Federal Reserve minted 40% of the Dollars in circulation in 2020 alone. How long can this money printing last before there are serious consequences? And when the bottom falls out\\u2026 again will the big corporations get more bailouts? What happens if our current money becomes worthless? It\\u2019s happened in the past and it can happen again.\\n\\nProtest\\n\\nBitcoin and the cryptocurrency movement is a protest or an alternative to the current global money system. Bitcoin and other decentralized cryptos are not tied to any government or corporation. They are an alternative way of doing finance and are meant as a way to give the average person a way out of the traditional financial system and it\\u2019s corrupt institutions.\\n\\nCompetition\\n\\nAt this point many people will laugh at the idea that a cryptocurrency could ever replace a local government currency?

In fact, traditional currencies like the US Dollar are what\\u2019s mainly used for illicit activity. Janet\\u2019s main complaint is that Bitcoin has a cash function to it which makes it a little easier for criminals wanting to use digital money.

This approach has cost many investors a lot of money. Jumping from token to token hoping to 100x their investment overnight, falling victim to various scams and poor money management are some of the sins that nearly all beginners are guilty of. Let\\u2019s breakdown a simple strategy that will ensure your portfolio is healthy and making money (please remember that there is always risk involved and this is by no means financial advice)\\n\\nHow to manage a healthy crypto investment portfolio?\\n\\n1. ~60% Bitcoin and Ethereum: This is where the majority of your capital should go. The top 2 coins are always what dictates the market and they are relatively safe investments.\\n\\n2. ~ 20% Top 20 Altcoins: Do your research, find altcoins that are already proven and have potential. Read the whitepapers, roadmaps and decide what you think will do well. These altcoins are also relatively safe (although more risky than bitcoin, ethereum).\\n\\n3. ~15% Your hidden Gem: This should be a low market cap token, proven but with a lot of upside. For me this is MarketMove and I will use this example to show you what to look for.\\n\\n * Doxxed team: You know who is behind the project and their previous work experience.\\n * Longevity: The token has been on the market for half a year, this is good proof of the devs commitment to the project.\\n * Value proposition: In this case it\\u2019s lowering the barrier of entry into crypto. This is something that has real value and could make the token worth a lot. This is what you want in a riskier, low market cap token. Remember we are looking for 10x+ returns on the riskier investments.\\n * Good design and website: just visit http://marketmove.ai and you will understand where I\\u2019m coming from. Any projects\\u2019 website is the first thing potential investors will see so make sure it\\u2019s well made and user friendly.\\n4. ~ 5% Gambling bankroll. Have fun with this, join presales, mint NTfs, and invest in meme coins. You will probably lose this money but you will learn a lot in the process. You could find the next Shiba or Doge, who knows. Remember, don\\u2019t expect any returns from this.\\n\\nThis is just an example that should give new investors an idea of what to do when entering the market.

Thank me later after using this platform.\\n\\nNew companies and developers are adding dozens of new offerings per month, most of which are now launched via initial coin offerings (ICOs). There is still a sense among many digital currency enthusiasts that, should the right opportunity come along, a new batch of digital currency millionaires (or billionaires) could be born in short order. But for those individuals who have not yet invested in the digital currency space, are there truly compelling reasons to start now? Below, we'll explore some of the considerations to keep in mind before exploring the cryptocurrency universe.\\n\\nPotential or Speculation?\\n\\nWhile many investors hold out hope that digital currency holdings could still reap the benefits of skyrocketing prices, there are prominent voices on the other side of the debate that suggest virtual tokens and coins are not so worthwhile. Investment leaders like JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon have gone so far as to criticize digital currencies for being nothing more than speculation driven or even to claim that they are a bubble disaster waiting to happen.\\n\\nOf course, even with speculation, one can find hordes of investors willing to take the risk. Look no further than any of the recent prominent ICOs to see just how much investors are willing to commit to new digital offerings, even now. EOS, one of the latest and most popular launches, has been plagued with bugs and issues getting during its efforts to get off the ground. Even as the EOS community, left virtually unaided by the digital currency's development team, has been able to sort out just how the EOS ecosystem will work, the \\\"decentralized\\\" currency is largely dominated by a small percentage of investors who hold a large majority of the tokens. Nonetheless, in spite of these many and varied challenges and concerns, EOS earned an unbelievable $4 billion over the course of a yearlong ICO.\\n\\nRegardless of the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies, there remain prominent supporters in the community willing to make bets on their future success. While it may be somewhat less often that famous analysts now predict six-figure valuations for tokens like BTC and ether, the mentality surrounding these forecasts remains among many in the broader investor base.\\n\\nAnother major concern over the potential of digital currencies has to do with widespread adoption in the mainstream financial and business worlds. While the industry has made inroads toward this goal, most in the community would agree that it has yet to truly break through. Whether one views this as a tremendous opportunity waiting to happen or as a sign that cryptocurrencies may never actually break into the mainstream depends upon your viewpoint and level of optimism.\\n\\nVolatility\\n\\nIt's widely known that digital currencies experience high (and sometimes extreme) levels of volatility. Nonetheless, it can be comforting to look to the record highs achieved across the industry in the final days of 2017 as an indication of the growth potential of the space. Perhaps that will change among cryptocurrency investors now that a study has suggested that bitcoin's epic climb toward $20,000 may have been the result of currency manipulation. In the time since that extreme high, BTC has sloughed off about two thirds of its value. It has spent weeks in a gradual decline, with some analysts now making predictions as to just how low it can go. Other cryptocurrencies have tended to follow bitcoin's lead; it is not uncommon for the entire digital currency space to drop billions of dollars in market cap in just a few hours.\\n\\nSecurity\\n\\nOne of the most impressive and unique aspects of cryptocurrency is also a significant liability. Owing to their decentralized nature, cryptocurrencies offer users both unprecedented levels of privacy and autonomy as well as new risks having to do with security. Experts have calculated that millions of dollars in digital tokens are stolen every day, on average. Even as the cryptocurrency space continues to develop with new offerings, hacks and fraudulent activity remain rampant. Those investors who choose to explore the digital currency space should be aware that a number of special security measures are absolutely necessary, and that even those measures may not sufficiently protect holdings against hackers working constantly to refine their techniques.\\n\\nWhile it's clear there are many reasons to be skeptical of digital currencies as a group, digital currency supporters have also offered a perspective that many traditional investors have also found compelling. The digital currency space is frequently referred to as a transformational industry, with the potential to disrupt the world in the same way that the internet did in the 1990s. Yes, the internet brought about the dotcom bubble, but it has also proven to have a far-reaching impact on virtually every area of public life. Supporters of digital currencies may be willing to ride out the equivalent bubbles and issues with the nascent cryptocurrency universe on the bet that it will ultimately have the same type of effect. If you subscribe to this belief, there's no time like the present to get involved in digital currency investments.\\n\\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (\\\"ICOs\\\") is highly risky and speculative, and this article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies or ICOs.

Real estate, mutual funds, interest-bearing accounts, is among the few investment options business-minded people are presented with.\\n\\nIn the past few years, cryptocurrency has become the new face of investment. Since its inception in 2009, bitcoin has seen lots of ups and downs with it increase and decrease in price. Regardless of its nature, it has also seen lots of investment in it since 2009.\\n\\nIf your question is whether it is ok to invest in the cryptocurrency, the answer will be yes, but you have to be ready for the roller coaster ride with respect to the rise and fall of the currency. It is amazing how bitcoin can surge in price within a twinkle of an eye and fall in price before you are done with rejoicing.\\n\\nEarlier this year, the price of bitcoin fell below $6000 which rose the concerns of investors and later surged to almost $9000. Thus to let you know cryptocurrencies are characterized by fluctuations every now and then hence it is advisable to invest with an amount you can afford to lose.\\n\\nDespite the uncertain nature of bitcoin, investors whom over a long period of time have invested in the currency can now boast of huge sums of money. If a person invested in bitcoin since 2011 with 1000 dollars, this person will have 36.7 million dollars to his credit as at January this year.\\n\\nSame way $100 invested in bitcoin in 2010 would be worth more than 28 million as at December 2017.

It would be a valid question to ask whether they were worth it or not.\\n\\nThis is exactly where the cryptocurrencies are at the moment. They\\u2019re at the stage where only a small group of people are incredibly convinced that this is going to be the future while the rest is still on the fence.\\n\\n * Is cryptocurrency worth it or should you ignore it?\\nThe best bit about buying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Lithcoin, BCH, Nexus, iExec, Ethereum and so on is that you don\\u2019t need to spend a lot of money to invest. In fact, if you have spare $50 then that\\u2019s enough to make an investment. There is literally no entry barrier and that alone makes cryptocurrencies revolutionising.

According to the stock to flow chart of Bitcoin, which calculates the theoretical value based on the current circulation of BTC in the market compared to the flow rate of new coins in the market, the value of Bitcoin is expected to reach $1million by the end of this decade.\\n\\nAnd, as the market is emerging and evolving rapidly, new markets within the cryptosphere are also witnessing huge growth. For instance, Defi or the decentralized finance ecosystem had grown from $700 million in December 2019 to $13 billion in December 2020. And, as per the industry estimate, it could grow to a $40 billion ecosystem by the end of this year.\\n\\nAnother major market that has witnessed 50-100 times growth in the last three months is the NFT marketplace. Starting 2021 and in less than three months, the combined market cap of the NFT project has grown 1785%, and NFTs are selling like a hot cake in the market.\\n\\nFinal Words\\n\\nCryptocurrencies provide a great and safer alternative to more traditional investment options.

But, the future of Cryptocurrency is still getting plenty of predictions every moment. People from different domains have started looking for these predictions. In December 2017, Bitcoin broke the trading charts by surging up to $20k, and became the most worthy cryptocurrency to the world.\\n\\nEven though Cryptocurrencies will impact the future \\u2014 the regulations will keep getting tighter. Countries like United States, United Kingdom, Australia have accepted Cryptocurrencies. In future, there are chances that other countries will come forward and accept Cryptocurrencies. We are all hoping that countries like \\u2013 Mexico, Thailand, and South Africa will take the necessary steps to make crypto legal and adopt the blockchain.\\n\\nBut, what do cryptocurrencies hold for us in the next decade? Analyzing Bitcoin on the wheel of fortune is tough. Who doesn\\u2019t want to know how cryptocurrencies will perform? Who doesn't love the gains of profits?No one can predict the future with certainty that is one thing for sure as no one ever thought bitcoins will be worth 20,000.00$ some years back in 2017. No one thought bitcoins will get this much attention as it is getting today with a lot of investors investing heavily on the cryptocurrency for potential gains. Aside buying and holding bitcoins for potential gainsas one of the advantages of cryptocurrency , I also recommend that you invest in service companies such as the Zippercoin(www.zippercoin.tech) company, a cryptocurrency investment company that gives return on investments made in days by capitalizing on the volatility of the crypto market to generate profits. Here are possible predictions for the future of crypto\\u2019s\\n\\nEveryone will start to use Cryptocurrencies \\u2014 and they may not even be aware of it.\\n\\nThough it has been a decade since the arrival of Cryptocurrencies, there are people who aren\\u2019t aware of it. They make use of the traditional method of transactions to manage the money flow. In the future, businesses will start using Cryptocurrencies to pay for their services. With this, businesses will remove the middleman from various processes. And it will reduces costs and makes their services cheaper for the end user. All this will happen even when people aren\\u2019t aware of the cryptocurrencies.\\n\\nBitcoins will hit $1 million.\\n\\nJohn McAfee has predicted a very bold thought about Bitcoin hitting $1 million by the end of 2020. He believes that, crypto currencies are the most trusted ones. Once the Bitcoin takes over the global economy, the demand will increase and the traditional dollars will no longer be needed.\\n\\nThe owner of Snapchat, Jeremy Liew and Blockchain co-founder Peter Smith predicts that by 2030, the price will have reached $500.000.\\n\\n * In the future, Bitcoin will act as Remittances for many people.\\n * Lack of knowledge can make the people buy Bitcoins as a safer mode of investment similar to Gold.\\n * With smartphone transactions, half of the world will march towards non-cash transactions by the year 2030.\\n * Cryptocurrencies will replace Fiat currencies.\\nAccording to Draper, one of the Crypto Enthusiast has recorded his view on the same. He says fiat currencies will disappear as people will start marching towards cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. The major reason for this adoption is people believe cryptocurrencies as the reliable storages of value across country borders and political aspects.\\n\\nIf you consider the most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, it has reached the top 30 currencies list by passing the $10.000 hallmark. Thus, most of the experts predict Cryptocurrencies are here to stay by being an alternative for Fiat Currencies. Moreover, it is said that the total lifespan of fiat currencies will be at a maximum of five years.\\n\\nGovernment Agencies will soon adopt Blockchain Technology.\\n\\nCountries with SEC Guidelines will start adopting cryptocurrencies for their government. Currently, Government agencies are maintaining a separate database. Each agency is dependent on the other for its processes. This has been a tedious process nowadays. When Blockchain comes into the picture, the distributed ledger can provide effective data management to enhance the process and make it simplified.\\n\\nIn the next ten years, we can expect powerful cryptocurrencies to rule the Governments and manage the cash flow in the country. Crypto enthusiasts predict Government agencies will soon start adopting this Decentralized systems for their processes. For example, the Estonian Government has already adopted Blockchain Technology called X-Road, which stores the complete credentials of all citizens.\\n\\nFuture of Cryptocurrencies will integrate with Internet of Things.\\n\\nIoT is already here. When both these giants get combined, we can expect a fantastic future of technologies without any doubts. According to the recent report by IDC, it is expected that Blockchain technology will join their hands with the Internet of Things soon.\\n\\nThe primary motto of the integration is to render a highly scalable and secure framework for communication between IoT devices. Yet another thing is Cryptocurrencies have the stability to make micro-investments for smart devices in an efficient way.\\n\\nCryptocurrency Exchanges Trading.\\n\\nThe Trading enthusiasts in the crypto world are marching towards cryptocurrency exchanges for trading In the near future, more cryptocurrencies will come into existence. With the growth in the price of cryptocurrencies, users will start trading with different currencies.\\n\\nAs Bitcoin is the popular cryptocurrency till the date, Ripple will also emerge to be the next Bitcoin in the future years. Along with this, Ethereum, Litecoin, Stellar will start to uprise their prices. As the price starts rising, it will have a great impact on crypto exchanges and the crypto world.\\n\\nBanking and Financial industries will undergo disruption.\\n\\nBlockchain and Cryptocurrencies have a lot to do with banking and financial sectors. Banks will eventually accept cryptocurrencies to reduce their complexities. Here are a few things cryptocurrency will do:\\n\\n1. People will start opening Cryptocurrency Bank Accounts.\\n2. Cryptocurrency Debit cards will become a normal thing.\\n3. Instead of withdrawing money, one can buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly from ATM\\u2019s.\\n4.

However, the administrative field is still trying to speed up with regard to major players in the virtual currency field. Yet, there have been enforcement activities and an updated focus around the regulation of crypto activities and users.\\n\\nCriticisms Faced\\n\\nOne of the serious criticisms of crypto is that there is no inherent worth. In fact, the worth it has is the worth that the world gives it. Nonetheless, experts believe that this is applicable for global fiat currencies as even they have not received any gold standard.\\n\\nSolid supporters for holding gold knew for quite a long time that outrageous printing of money would cause a devaluation in the currency. Since gold has a generally limited inventory and has truly been viewed as significant, they use it as a fence against inflation and a method for keeping the government away from their bank accounts.\\n\\nCuriously, the absolute staunchest cryptocurrency users hold coins for some reason that individuals hold gold. The fundamental distinction between the two is the fresh blood of cryptocurrency, having no demonstrated h\\n\\nistory of long-term value.\\n\\nJoseph A. Grundfest, Professor at the Stanford Law School also adds that cryptocurrency is a trustless system. Since it is not directly related to any government or state, people have a hard time trusting cryptocurrency.\\n\\nHowever, Joseph argues that this is not the case with regard to future trading crypto. Cryptocurrencies rely on infrastructure, much of which is operated from China. So, chances are the Chinese government could introduce changes in cryptocurrencies by forcing its will on the data miners who keep them running.\\n\\nWhat Next?\\n\\nDespite everything, many countries have started adopting and legalizing cryptocurrencies. This indicates a positive attitude towards cryptocurrency as well as the future of crypto looks promising. In India, the Supreme Court overturned the crypto ban, yet regulations will soon come into the picture.\\n\\nNot just India, many other countries that have effectively adopted cryptocurrency have put regulations in place to ensure economic viability and progress, without harming the interests of the public.\\n\\nJust like we have heated discussions of how important it is to regulate artificial intelligence to ensure AI is used ethically and responsibly, similarly, regulations on cryptocurrency are vital too.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s time we use each technology responsibly as recently a lot of legal challenges are piling up on tech giants like Amazon, Google, Apple, etc. on the grounds of antitrust issues.\\n\\nWith regards to the future of cryptocurrency, we will definitely see more growth and adoption. Yet, with China\\u2019s ban on a cryptocurrency exchange, it is quite uncertain how things might turn out for cryptocurrency trading in the future. A ban from a strong and powerful nation is something we should ponder on. Are there certain aspects of cryptocurrency that we don\\u2019t know? Or the future of the crypto market is completely dependent upon its volatility?\\n\\nRight now, it\\u2019s too soon to carve out or predict the future of cryptocurrency.

Nonetheless, it is absolutely a change agent in the financial industry as well as for investors."}, {"upvote": 495, "content": "This article/whitepaper I just wrote answers this question:\\n\\nDecentralized Finance 3.0+: The Path To A New Financial System\\n\\nThere is a fierce battle happening this very moment between the legacy banking system and the innovation that is cryptocurrency decentralized finance.\\n\\nOne side has held unequivocal power for generations and been able to conform the monetary system to suit its needs; the other looks to completely transform the status quo by disrupting this centralized institution.\\n\\nThis article will:\\n\\n1. Define what legacy banking means and how it operates and profits.\\n2. Explain the history of the disruptor, Decentralized Finance.\\n3. Discuss the logical evolution & future iterations of DeFi by laying out the direct impact it will have on our lives.\\nLegacy Banking: The Truth About The Middlemen And The Money Printer\\n\\nThe entire legacy banking system is built on a foundation of charging fees and generating interest on money it doesn\\u2019t own. A common misconception is that banks make money by accepting deposits and lending it out at a higher rate. What actually happens is much deeper and more one-sided than that. The secret weapon of banks, and what they actually do, is take deposits (customers money) and use that as their reserve requirement to borrow many times that amount from the federal reserve bank. This capital is then used for lending to yield much higher returns, because they leveraged up their lending capacity. This \\u2018using your money to borrow more money to lend it back to you with interest\\u2019 is ALL inflation. Meanwhile, banks offer sub 1% on deposits. This is the power of the legacy banking system.\\n\\nAdding to this theft, 30-40% of all the U.S. dollars in existence today were printed out of thin air in a 12-month period. If the USD was a cryptocurrency, it might be one of the worse ones. Stablecoins backed by USD may not be so \\u201cstable\\u201d in the future.\\n\\nIf that weren\\u2019t enough, with the \\u201cbail in\\u201d laws passed by the Obama administration, depositors can have their capital seized if their bank fails. This law puts depositors first in line to cover any insolvencies of a failed bank.\\n\\nMany see it as unfair and dishonest to have to pay for a bank's risk taking while receiving zero benefit from this endless inflation of fiat currency that is printed out of thin air.\\n\\nEarly warning signs of this battle have become evident in that yields in cryptocurrency are quickly eroding at the asset base (reserves used to borrow from the Fed) of traditional banks. Consumers are moving to much higher yielding cryptocurrency staking to earn transaction fees in liquidity pools and rewards/interest for staking cryptocurrency.\\n\\nDecentralized finance: Enter The Disruptor.\\n\\nDecentralized finance, or DeFi, defined by investopedia: A system by which financial products become available on a public decentralized blockchain network. That makes them open to anyone to use, rather than going through middlemen like banks or brokerages. Unlike a bank or brokerage account, a government-issued ID, Social Security number, or proof of address are not necessary to use DeFi. More specifically, DeFi refers to a system by which software written on blockchains makes it possible for buyers, sellers, lenders, and borrowers to interact peer to peer or with a strictly software-based middleman rather than a company or institution facilitating a transaction.\\n\\nWe will now look at the progression of DeFi.\\n\\nPre-DeFi\\n\\nThe setup for DeFi flourishing was enabled by Ethereum's ability to \\u2018program money\\u2019 using their smart contract platform. For the first time, anyone could create a digital currency for any use they liked. This movement became its own fundraising event for new blockchain protocols called Initial Coin Offerings (ICO\\u2019s). To create buzz around a project, airdrops or free tokens were given to build communities.\\n\\nPre-DeFi created the term tokenomics (token economy), which is the creation of self-sustainable mini digital economies. Through the study of tokenomics, we are able to see game theory in action and how players in a system behave. There are now countless token economies in existence today that provide proof of what works and what does not.\\n\\nDeFi 1.0: Defi Summer 2020\\n\\nDuring the summer of 2020, decentralized finance began the initial replacement of the legacy banking system. There were multiple things in place that created a major inflection point for cryptocurrency and DeFI:\\n\\nBrowser Wallets like Metamask made it very easy to create wallets and interact directly with blockchain applications.\\n\\nDecentralized Exchanges came into prominence with UniSwap giving users the ability to swap tokens anonymously without the verification steps centralized exchanges require.\\n\\nStablecoins allowed you to stay in cryptocurrency and not have to exchange in and out of fiat when you were entering or exiting trades. They also maintained your value until your next trade. During DeFi summer, stablecoins like DAI from MakerDao allowed for leverage for cryptocurrency traders.\\n\\nStablecoin Evolution: 3 Types:\\n\\n1. Centralized and Physically Asset-Backed.\\n\\nStablecoins like Tether and Paxos Gold physically back their cryptocurrency with USD and physical gold, respectively. You buy these on the open market or supply the physical collateral/USD for these protocols to \\u201cmint\\u201d new stablecoin. This is a way to preserve your value. However, centralized systems require faith that 1 Tether actually is 1 USD when you redeem. Tether has come under scrutiny with claims that there is not actually a 1:1 Tether/USD ratio. Furthermore, systems like this are easily shut down by banks or regulators. Physically asset-backed stablecoins provide an attractive alternative to invest in the cryptocurrency market, while giving you exposure to another asset like gold.\\n\\n2. Crypto-Collateralized.\\n\\nThe stablecoin market, then, evolved to take a step to further decentralization. Stablecoins like MakeDAO use ETH-based cryptocurrencies as collateral to mint their stablecoin. With systems like this, you are not relying on a centralized authority or entity to \\u201cback\\u201d the stablecoin. It is only you pledging the collateral to a smart contract which is public proof that it exists as collateral on the blockchain. This gives you certainty that the system truly has underlying value that can\\u2019t be taken away or falsified (like the Tether accusations). However, in times of market volatility, your collateral can be liquidated if the \\u201cloan to value\\u201d ratio breaks a threshold.\\n\\n3. Algorithmic.\\n\\nPurely algorithmic stablecoins rely on market forces and smart contract software rules to maintain the price of the dollar or whatever asset they are tracking. Terra Luna is a 2-token system (utility token and stablecoin) that allows you to burn one of the tokens to mint the other in times of stablecoin price instability. For example, if the price of TerraUSD is above the dollar, you can burn the utility token for TerraUSD at the exchange rate at the price it should be. Then, you can sell for a profit helping to bring the price back down of 1 TerraUSD equal to 1 USD. Incentivizing the market keeps the stablecoin at the price it should be. Purely algorithmic stablecoins have no underlying collateral. If market forces fail or there are issues with the software code, there is no recourse to get your money back.\\n\\nLeverage in DeFi is done from minting a stablecoin, then using the stablecoin to buy more collateral to mint more stablecoin. When the ETH price collapses, collateral that was used to mint DAI, many are automatically liquidated out of their position.\\n\\nStaking involves locking up your cryptocurrency to earn interest or rewards. The most well-known staking is in proof of stake blockchain protocols where you earn part of the transaction fees of the network. You could also stake in a decentralized lending platform like AAVE to earn interest or stake in a liquidity pool in a decentralized exchange like UniSwap. In UniSwap, you earn transaction fees for providing liquidity to traders of that decentralized exchange.\\n\\nYield Farming is staking or lending crypto assets in order to generate higher returns or rewards in the form of additional cryptocurrency. Typically, new protocols would give you more of their tokens for staking in their liquidity pools in addition to the transaction fees you would earn. This made returns soar.\\n\\nDeFi 2.0: Flood Of Innovation\\n\\nI spent some time looking for a universally accepted definition for DeFi 2.0. There was no clear description. What is clear however is there is massive innovation happening at a speed which has never been seen in technology. It takes hours a day of study to keep up with everything that is happening. I call DeFi 2.0 the \\u201cFlood Of Innovation\\u201d which is helping blockchain entrepreneurs to experiment incredibly fast. With the open-source nature of blockchain, learning what is working economically and being able to leverage existing code is causing the speed and flood of innovation. It is DeFi 2.0 that is setting the stage for DeFi 3.0+ and a clear path to this new financial system.\\n\\nWe will discuss the areas setting up DeFi 3.0+.\\n\\nWith much development on ETH causing higher gas fees, other protocols are competing to offer faster and lower cost smart contract platforms. Binance, Avalanche, Solana and PulseChain are a few. However, ETH remains the dominant platform with 65% or so of the DeFi market.\\n\\nOther protocols like Cosmos are helping to bring about blockchain interoperability & cross-chain liquidity. They allow you to move one token on a blockchain to another joining these ledgers. One method this is being done with is bridges where the token is locked on the native blockchain you are leaving and a \\u201cwrapped\\u201d version of the token, which mimics the native token price, is minted on the blockchain you transfer in to.\\n\\nScalability has become a big issue on Ethereum while the protocol looks towards solving that with scharding (splitting the database) and using a proof of stake consensus algorithm. Layer 2 solutions like Polygon create a \\u201cside chain\\u201d to perform transactions to post/verify transactions on the ETH mainnet.\\n\\nDecentralized Oracles provide a way for blockchain applications to get pricing they need to operate without the worry of the price feed being shut down or being wrong. Chain Link seems to be the dominant player in this area.\\n\\nUp until recently, projects needing to bootstrap liquidity would give rewards in the form of their token to liquidity providers. This \\u201crenting of liquidity\\u201d is not sustainable because liquidity providers run to the next higher yielding project crashing the project they just left. Protocols like OlympusDAO and Tokemak are solving this by incentivizing liquidity providers with token rewards where the protocol owns the liquidity (POL: Protocol Owned Liquidity). This economic and technological direction will lead to a \\u201cLiquidity Singularity\\u201d, combined with blockchain interoperability, where you will be able to swap from any token on any blockchain to another easily.\\n\\nNFT\\u2019s are putting a period at the end of the DeFi 2.0 transformation. Non-fungible tokens are one-of-a-kind tokens that represent the unique ownership of a digital asset. NFT\\u2019s by well-known artists are selling for outrageous amounts in the 10\\u2019s of millions. Welcome to the world of the million-dollar JPEG\\u2019s!\\n\\nThe Future Of DeFi And How It Will Affect Us\\n\\nDeFi 3.0: Infrastructure For Mass Adoption\\n\\nWe are still in the problem of mass consumer adoption and real business use cases for cryptocurrency. There are 3 elements that need to be in place to have mass adoption in cryptocurrency and make up DeFi 3.0.\\n\\nStablecoins are the holy grail because they hold the key to mass adoption of cryptocurrency. People won\\u2019t trust a stablecoin to preserve their value unless it preserves their value and can\\u2019t be shut down or taken away. The everyday person will not get their paycheck in a stablecoin unless they know what they earned will be there. There is a battle of the stablecoins happening not only within DeFi but governments trying to compete with their centralized and highly controlled Central Bank Digital Currencies concepts. Governments are looking to regulate stablecoins because they cannot compete with the free market. Governments and Central Banks have a different agenda following the ESG public policy nonsense (guiding investments around Environmental, Social and Governance.).\\n\\nA Regulation Target\\n\\nLet\\u2019s face it. Regulation of crypto is all about trying to maintain control and the threat to the US Dollar world reserve currency status. The US government would lose the ability to print money out of thin air for political control and to loan/donate to countries for \\u201cfavors\\u201d and decisions that could potentially benefit the US.\\n\\nCrypto makes it more difficult to track transactions and people. This is not acceptable to the US government. Biden recently began tracking all USD bank accounts with more than $600, a complete violation of the 4th amendment and many other things.\\n\\nThe \\u201cinfrastructure bill\\u201d has provisions where everyone in crypto is a broker and subject to KYC compliance. How can a blockchain developer track who is using software that has been released to the world and has a life of its own (the nature of decentralization)?\\n\\nStablecoins are the target because they remove the need to go back into fiat, where KYC and tracking can occur. Stablecoins are also widely used. SEC Chairman Gensler said \\u201cthat roughly 75% of all crypto trades involve some kind of stablecoin\\u201d.\\n\\nFor the first time in history, we have a technology that has the potential to change the relationship between man and government. This change is in favor of the individual so governments are fighting it.\\n\\nEffects of Regulation Overreach\\n\\n1.\\n\\nInnovation moves to countries that embrace the change. If the USA regulations go too far, it will cripple the chances of continued financial dominance and move it to other countries. The economic impact of the convergence of a multitude of technological platforms is going to have a 20X+ the impact of the Internet. (Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Energy Storage and Genome Sequencing) No country can afford to push innovation in these areas to other countries.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nBlockchain protocol creators go dark and release anonymous projects.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nBlockchain systems will move further to decentralization and be impossible to be captured.\\n\\nWhat does decentralized finance mean in this context?\\n\\nSince a stablecoin is a cryptocurrency in the government\\u2019s crosshairs, decentralization is crucial. It means that every aspect of the protocol cannot be influenced, seized or shut down by any government, bank or organization. Every part of a defi protocol needs to be capture proof. This makes it a safer choice for many people who want to keep their money safe from governmental interference and manipulation.\\n\\nThe process of decentralization\\n\\nThis is not easy, but it can be achieved by using distributed ledger technology. This is the technology that is used to record transaction history and information on many computers or \\u201cnodes\\u201d at once. When all nodes are updated with the same information, this data cannot be changed or falsified.\\n\\nThis allows for a defi stablecoin to be fully transparent, unchangeable and accessible to all users. As you can imagine, this will be an excellent choice for anyone who wants to keep their money safe but also remain anonymous.\\n\\nDespite the progress in defi, a vast majority if not all blockchain dApps (decentralized apps) are not fully decentralized. Website servers, domains and server access to blockchains, like Infura for ETH blockchain access, are still centralized and can be captured. Case in point is when UniSwap delisted all stablecoins from its \\u201cdecentralized exchange\\u201d front end at the potential threat of the SEC regulating stablecoins and investigating UniSwap. Liquidity pools for these stablecoins plummeted even though they are decentralized on the blockchain. The front-end access is not.\\n\\nProtocols like the Internet Computer and Cartesi have solutions to decentralize front servers and cloud computing. However, the crypto industry has yet to take the final step.\\n\\nA regulation proof Stablecoin\\n\\nTo be truly decentralized, a regulation proof stablecoin needs to be both crypto-collateralized and algorithmic. It cannot have any single entity in the process like what we see in all of the physical asset or USD-backed centralized systems. Having the stablecoin backed by other cryptocurrencies gives faith in the system that there is underlying value that can be redeemed at any time without centralization. Also, it must be algorithmic to provide further price stability. This is the best possible combination of stablecoin capabilities that exists in the market.\\n\\nAll of the processes must occur in the smart contract on the blockchain making it unchangeable and visible to everyone. Front end website, website server and blockchain access also must be decentralized with multiple, capture proof access points.\\n\\nFurthermore, a stablecoin cannot be pegged to a fiat currency price since most will just be inflated into oblivion. Tracking the price of a physical asset, like precious metals, is a much better store of value.\\n\\nPhilosophically, the creation of currency should be decentralized rather than a single entity controlling the money supply for a nation. Since the best currencies have an underlying asset, the collateral owner should be the one earning the interest.\\n\\ndApps (Decentralized Apps) with the right use cases will drive the usage of the stablecoin replacing legacy banking.\\n\\nCrypto Credit Card: This is an important application as it allows the crypto community to spend crypto in the legacy payment system (point of sale and online) where the card holder pays in crypto but the merchant receives fiat currency.\\n\\nB2B Payments: This $23 trillion per year market is an excellent use case of a stablecoin to make fast, bankless business-to-business payments to trusted vendors much less expensively. As more companies begin to transition to crypto in their corporate treasury, a stablecoin payment will be the natural progression. The blockchain gives an easy way for businesses to automatically account for payments and financial reporting.\\n\\nCross Border Payments: The consumer version of B2B payments is sending money to anyone in the world, anytime with little cost. This is nearly a $40 trillion per year market.\\n\\neCommerce: Online purchases are a $4 trillion per year market. This doesn\\u2019t necessarily need to be its own decentralized application but could be a browser extension taking over the shopping cart allowing the purchaser to spend crypto and settling in fiat to the merchant.\\n\\nEscrow: Using the blockchain and a stablecoin, escrow services would cease to have middlemen and escrow agents for things like real estate transactions, stock and company acquisitions and automobile purchases.\\n\\nInternational Physical Commodity Trading: Another escrow type transaction, a $16 trillion per year market, would be to use the blockchain for the purchase of physical commodities from one country to another. These transactions take too much time, have unneeded middlemen and tremendous fraud. Banks also charge high fees to handle the payments for these transactions in the form of Letters of Credit and Standby Letters of Credit. An example of an application like this could remove as much as 15% of the cost and dramatically lower the process time using the blockchain: www.Exportly.io [ http://www.exportly.io/ ]\\n\\nSwift Replacement: Banks communicate with each other and transfer capital using the SWIFT system. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication was created in 1973. It is time for something better, a messaging service for crypto transactions where the counterparties communicate directly with each other. Each identity, KYC (Know Your Client) and proof of funds is proven by the blockchain. The messaging is verified, encrypted and secured on the blockchain. This makes larger transactions truly sovereign.\\n\\nNFT\\u2019s will evolve to where they represent tokenized ownership of real-world assets like real estate and cars, etc. One blockchain project tokenized the ownership of a resort and sold fractionalized ownership. Imagine a NFT representing your fractional ownership of an apartment building. Net rental income is paid to you in crypto every month. NFT\\u2019s will also represent digital ownership of financial instruments like stocks and bonds.\\n\\nI envision a cryptocurrency that would allow you to mint a stablecoin using a NFT. In fact, we are building this type of stablecoin with this capability. www.BankX.io [ http://www.bankx.io/ ] is the first cryptocurrency to pay you interest for minting a stablecoin. Version 2 of the system will allow you to stake a NFT to mint the stablecoin. You can see with a system like this that traditional collateralized loans become useless. Why pay interest to a lender when you can use your collateral to not only create a currency but also to earn interest.\\n\\nDeFi 4.0: Onramp\\n\\nIn the future, everything you do will involve a private key. It will not only be your crypto wallet but your identity, KYC information, access to your sensitive documents, how you send secure financial messages, interaction with all dApps and hold and control your tokenized ownership of physical and digital assets. This transformation cannot be understated. It will have a 10X+ impact larger than the innovation around the Internet.\\n\\nIf stablecoins, dApps and NFT\\u2019s are the key to mass adoption, the wallet is the onramp to this new financial system. Cathie Wood of Ark Invest said, \\u201cWe see the wallet market as a winner take all scenario.\\u201d This statement stuck with me because I agree with her and have thought this for some time. However, the solution is not just an \\u201ceasy to use\\u201d mobile app although that will help.\\n\\nCrypto wallets have these categories:\\n\\nSelf-custody where you own and control the private keys and seed phrase. Crypto enthusiasts say \\u201cNot your keys, not your crypto.\\u201d. This is a great way to keep your keys but if you lose the private key, the seed phrase or someone else gets access, you could lose your crypto.\\n\\nMulti-Sig wallets give a layer of protection since 2 or more people need to sign the transaction before the crypto is sent. However, you need a consensus with the wallet holders before a transaction where disputes could prevent this from happening.\\n\\nThird-Party custody services like Galaxy Digital store your keys in their vaults. Institutions usually opt for this solution but you are relying on someone else for the security of your keys. Fireblocks recently \\u201clost\\u201d the keys to $70M in ETH. This \\u2018relying on others\\u2019 to secure your keys is the same issue you have with keeping your crypto in centralized exchanges.\\n\\nAs the Internet collapses into Distributed Ledger Technology, the crypto community needs its own network. This will be a separate, Internet-less, overlay network that will store the private keys for everything you do in this new financial system. This network will provide \\u201cDecentralized Custody\\u201d of your keys in the most secure network initially in servers in vaults, then in satellites. The move to a satellite network will prohibit any physical access to the actual storage devices. Not only will this system be incredibly easy to use but you will never be connected to the Internet but you will always be connected to your keys. Decentralized custody brings the best elements of the types of private key custody that are available in the market today but also give you the advantages of both a hot and cold wallet (hot is connected to the Internet and the cold wallet is not).\\n\\nThis decentralized custody network will evolve solutions that were offered in previous DeFi iterations. Blockchain interoperability will be achieved through this decentralized custody network and users will not have to rely on protocols like Cosmos bridging between chains. Interoperability happens at the network and wallet level. This will allow dApps and blockchain protocols to operate on all or multiple chains giving the general dApp system further decentralization. Different blockchains have different advantages and disadvantages. By running natively on these chains, the market and the specific user choses what is best for them. You can move between any crypto to any crypto in this overlay network. This network also provides a certain element of privacy as you move from one blockchain to another using this decentralized custody overlay network. An example of this is using the Exodus wallet to swap from one crypto on one blockchain to another crypto on a different blockchain. This is expensive to do. In the future, this will be seamless and free.\\n\\nWe are building this exact solution at: www.LockBox.io [ http://www.lockbox.io/ ]\\n\\nDefi 3.0 and 4.0 are enormous inflection points for the crypto movement.\\n\\nDeFi 5.0: Artificial Intelligence And The Blockchain\\n\\nAI is a generic term that is thrown around and applications using it are often mislabeled. To see the impact of artificial intelligence, it is important to understand the differences in the technology.\\n\\nMachine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Artificial Intelligence\\n\\nThe main difference between deep and machine learning is that machine learning models progressively get better. However, the model still needs some guidance. If a machine learning model returns an inaccurate prediction, then the programmer needs to fix that problem clearly and specifically. In the case of deep learning, the model does this by itself. Automatic automobile driving systems are a good example of deep learning. Artificial Intelligence is a computer acting like a human.\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence and the Blockchain need to have a symbiotic relationship. The blockchain keeps AI in check (not running off and killing humans as described by AI dystopians), verifies data and algorithms and artificial intelligence makes the blockchain more efficient and secure.\\n\\nHere are examples of how the Blockchain and AI will work together in DeFi 5.0:\\n\\n1. Blockchain verifies the data sources and their authenticity. AI uses the blockchain for data integrity before it is sent to the AI algorithm proving what data is trustable. The blockchain also verifies the AI algorithm itself and that it was from the intended author via blockchain identity verification.\\n2. AI scans the blockchain for transaction fraud of all types.\\n3. AI scans for blockchain operational efficiency.\\n4. Track counterparty blockchain identity and KYC for fraud.\\n5. Learns counterparty behavior and transactions in DEFI to find fraud and other criminal behavior.\\n6. Anticipates security threats.\\n7. AI on mobile devices analyzes typing and swiping behavior on the touchscreen to make sure it is the user. (Signature, Gestures and Typing)\\n8. Blockchain is version control and gives the ability to unwind the advancement of the algorithm as the deep learning algorithms evolve. This would ensure the dystopian future doesn\\u2019t occur.\\n9. Blockchain will allow the sharing of threat intelligence, authentication of digital identities in those that use the shared intelligence.\\n10. There will be a platform where financial security companies can share data, models and/or insights to better protect against fraud using the blockchain allowing for this type of \\\"Swarm Intelligence\\\". The end user controls what data is shared. AI models can be traded between security companies. Each security company builds and trains the model with their local data for a specific purpose. I envision a market of algorithms, different weights and biases for specific purposes that can be automatically traded and verified on the blockchain.\\n11. AI for intelligence gathering, generation of real-time threat alerts, draw correlations between related threat data and improve analysis of existing and emerging threats.\\nDeFi 6.0: Automated Machine-2-Machine Transactions\\n\\nThe last step in the replacement of the legacy banking and financial system is where transactions are automated. The blockchain is verifying identity, data, AI algorithms, etc. AI is kept friendly using the blockchain. AI models progress to the point where the entire supply chain is automated and working flawlessly. The exact product, amount and delivery time is exactly what you need just as you need it. Machines are communicating with each other constantly monitoring behavior and preferences of every human on earth delivering what they need exactly when they need it, the equivalent of the economic invisible hand in digital, blockchain, AI form.\\n\\nThe battle of legacy banking vs DeFi pits a dinosaur with slow to change aspects, drowning in a sea of overhead and regulation against a young, lean, quickly iterative new entrant to the marketplace.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nOne of two financial systems is going to prevail over the next decade, a new decentralized one designed to benefit the people or a digital version of the centralized, corrupt legacy banking system we have today. This whitepaper outlines the steps of the former. For this to happen, cryptocurrency needs mass adoption. Mass adoption is going to need the right stablecoin with decentralized apps that are better, faster and less expensive to transact than the current systems in place. With the setup for mass adoption, an onramp with the right cryptocurrency wallet is needed. This will be a private network which decentralizes the custody of your private keys and cryptocurrency wallets as the best solution. Decentralized custody is superior to self-custody or 3rd party custody because no one else has digital or physical access to your keys and they can\\u2019t be lost. You are always connected but never connected to the Internet (where most of the hacks occur). This paves the way for artificial intelligence and automation in this new decentralized financial system.\\n\\n"}, {"upvote": 82, "content": "Cryptocurrencies are developing not only in perspective of price.

However, it's still the largest and most popular cryptocurrency by a wide margin, and the long-term investment thesis is still intact.\\n\\nSpecifically, Bitcoin's source code imposes a supply limit of 21 million tokens. Similar to gold and other finite assets, that quality makes Bitcoin valuable. Basic economic principles suggest that, when supply is held constant, rising demand leads to rising prices. And Bitcoin's popularity should keep it in high demand for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nFidelity released a study in 2020 suggesting that 36% of institutional investors owned digital assets, with Bitcoin and Ethereum being the most popular holdings. Earlier this year, a follow-up study indicated that 52% of institutional investors owned digital assets, and Bitcoin and Ethereum still ranked first and second. More importantly, 71% of those surveyed said they planned to buy digital assets in the future, up from 59% last year.\\n\\nThat trend bodes well for crypto investors, especially those holding Bitcoin and Ethereum. Going forward, as institutional adoption continues to rise and big money pours into the crypto market, Bitcoin's price should rise too.

However, it's still the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and the second-most-valuable cryptocurrency. And like Bitcoin, its long-term investment thesis is still intact. Specifically, DeFi products make it possible to lend, borrow, and earn interest on cryptocurrency without involving banks or other financial institutions. And by eliminating those third parties, DeFi products make the financial system more accessible and more efficient. In fact, Wood recently noted that DeFi is \\\"collapsing the cost of the infrastructure for financial services.\\\"\\n\\nWhy does that matter? With $165 billion invested in DeFi products, Ethereum is the most popular DeFi platform by a wide margin. For context, Binance Coin ranks second with just $17 billion invested in DeFi. Not surprisingly, Ethereum's edge has captured the attention of institutional investors. In fact, 20% already own Ethereum. And more importantly, DeFi is gaining popularity at a rapid pace.\\n\\nOver the past year, the total amount invested in DeFi products across any blockchain climbed from $17 billion to $253 billion -- that's a fourteenfold increase in a very short time period. And as that trend continues, Ethereum's popularity means it should command an outsized portion of the market. Of course, DeFi services aren't free. Investors pay transactions fees using the blockchain's native cryptocurrency.

The use of cryptographic methods to solve the double-spend problem (that one person might spend the same money twice because the money is digital) really is a breakthrough.\\n\\nThe generalization of that insight with Ethereum, that coins could be used to power a platform (a global computer), rather than simply keeping a list (ledger) of stuff is the second major breakthrough.\\n\\nNow, it\\u2019s not only possible for those without banks to have money, but also to run decentralized financial exchanges [ https://uniswap.org/ ], have decentralized insurance [ https://www.insurace.io/ ], build games out of art (NFTs) [ https://binamon.org/ ], trade stocks on the blockchain [ https://terra.mirror.finance/ ], and on and on.\\n\\nThe result is a massive technological revolution on three fronts:\\n\\n1. the financial and banking world\\n2. the art and creative content world\\n3. the world of web technologies\\nEach one of those is a massive technological disruption the only comparison for which is the development of the internet in the late 1990s.\\n\\n2.

One is that you need some sort of new development (check above), another is that you need to have easy access to the financial units of that development.\\n\\nRobinhood, for example, made the buying of DOGE easy, which in part explains why it took off.\\n\\nThird, you need liquidity.

That is true for cryptocurrency in general and likely for you as a person as well.\\n\\nWith cryptocurrency being young, and the market being historically volatile, there is no yes or no answer about the wisdom of investing in cryptocurrency. It is with this in mind that we cover some pros and cons and friendly (but not professional) advice.\\n\\nNow that you can invest hugely on Power-Miner Startup Lab (www.power-miner.store) where you can get daily profit off your bitcoin investments for as long as 6 months through mining and daily trading, then life is getting better for Bitcoin investors now. Thanks to the world cryptocurrency leaders for bringing in other options of earning cryptocurrency\\n\\nHow to invest in cryptocurrency: If you want to invest in cryptocurrency, and not just buy, sell, or trade, then you have a few options. New investors can choose between the GBTC trust sold on the stock market, a cryptocurrency IRA (we don\\u2019t want to recommend one until we have reviewed them), or an exchange-broker-wallet hybrid like Coinbase/GDAX which allows customers to buy/sell actual cryptocurrency. Each option has its pros and cons, but notably, only an exchange-broker like Coinbase/GDAX allows one to trade and invest directly in cryptocurrency. Learn more about how to invest in cryptocurrency.\\n\\nGeneral advice: With the above said, please note that we don\\u2019t offer professional legal, investing, or tax advice on this site. With that in mind, the best advice is to be prepared to lose every penny you invest in cryptocurrency, it probably won\\u2019t happen, but it could, and you need to go into the cryptocurrency with some stored up resilience. If, with that warning, you want to ease into cryptocurrency investing. Consider taking no more than 1% of your investable funds, and then get a toe wet with GBTC or Coinbase. Keep it simple to start, and then consider easing into other options like online cryptocurrency exchanges or even cryptocurrency mining. Also, consider dollar cost averaging (taking your funds for the year and buying weekly or monthly on lows). This will help you buy the average price of an otherwise volatile market. Sure, you can jump right in, but if you time the market wrong, you could be in for an unnecessarily tense roller coaster ride.\\n\\nTIP: The least risky coins are usually the coins that have been around the longest and have the highest market cap and highest volume. Anything other than Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Ethereum is riskier than those three. Of those, Bitcoin is the current top coin for longevity, market cap, and volume. It is notably also the most expensive.\\n\\nThe Pros and Cons of Investing in Cryptocurrency\\n\\nThere are several pros and cons to consider before investing in cryptocurrency. Some of the most important features of cryptocurrency investing can be summarized as follows:\\n\\nCON: The cryptocurrency market has been very volatile since its inception. The price of Bitcoin can swing up or down hundreds of dollars in a day, and the price more than quadrupled in 2017. We have already seen one bubble and bust back in 2013, and currently in 2017 bitcoin looks like it is in a classical bubble. In fact, our header image is a reference to the psychology of bubbles. Specifically, it is a reference to \\u201cthe Minsky cycle,\\u201d which may give you an idea of how likely it is that we are in bubble territory. That said, there are many more factors to consider here. If there weren\\u2019t, the answer to investing in cryptocurrency would have just been a simple \\u201cno.\\u201d\\n\\nPRO: There is a significant upside to investing in cryptocurrency. That is, the cryptocurrency market is still young, and the most optimistic of investors are projecting future prices that would make buying any of the major cryptocurrencies (even at the height of 2017) a good bet. If Bitcoin goes to $6k, $7k, $15k, or say $600K+ like some notable investors suggest, $4.2K (about what it trades here in the second week of September 2017) is going to end up looking like a great price, regardless of what happens in the interim.\\n\\nCON: Even if cryptocurrency is a good long-term bet, we don\\u2019t know if Bitcoin (or any of the top coins) will be the one that sticks around. This is even more true for the countless less popular coins with smaller market caps. Thus, there is a risk in betting on a given coin even if cryptocurrency is here to stay and the best prices are ahead.\\n\\nPRO: Even if cryptocurrency is in a bubble, the trend could very well be toward cryptocurrency being an important medium of exchange and store of value in the future. If the current price is lower than the highest price we will ever see. That makes it a good long-term bet. Meanwhile, for day traders, cryptocurrency is a very risky (but potentially rewarding bet).\\n\\nCON: Those with low risk tolerance have an added difficulty; they are prone to getting weak knees and pulling out at a loss while the market is correcting or slumping. If you bought Microsoft at the height of the .com bubble, it seemed like the end of the world unless you waited 17 years. 17 years later you realized your profit and a nice profit at that. Microsoft was never a bad bet; it only looked like one after the bubble popped to those who bought at the height of the bubble. If Bitcoin behaves like the Microsoft of cryptocurrency, then an investor needs to be prepared to take a loss or sit on a loss for a while if the market goes down (if this is a major bubble). That takes a certain type of steady mindset and expendable funds. In other words, there are psychological factors to consider along with economic ones."}, {"upvote": 9, "content": "LUNA is almost gone\\u2026 Cardano & Ethereum standing strong!\\n\\nIMO - Invest in cryptocurrencies with full knowledge\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nNowadays, you don't have to look far to find someone who has invested in cryptocurrencies. While some people have made a fortune trading cryptocurrencies, others have lost it all because they didn't know the risks involved. If you want to join the growing number of investors who use cryptocurrencies to make money, you should learn how to trade and invest with caution. There are many ways for beginners to learn about investing in cryptocurrency, such as buying digital assets through an exchange and then holding them for more than a year before selling them at a profit.\\n\\nKnow the cryptocurrency market and technology and use cases\\n\\n * Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies. They are a form of money, but not all currencies are cryptocurrencies.\\n * Cryptocurrencies are decentralized. This means that there is no central authority (like a bank) that can control them or manipulate them in any way. Instead, they are controlled by an open network of computers around the world, also known as \\\"miners.\\\" These miners verify transactions on the blockchain and help ensure that no one can tamper with it without being noticed immediately.\\n * Cryptocurrencies use \\\"blockchain\\\" technology to record transactions permanently and publicly on an unalterable ledger called a \\\"blockchain.\\\" For this reason, cryptocurrencies have been described as being \\\"decentralized,\\\" since there is no single entity controlling them or managing them from one location like you'd see with traditional banks or governments issuing their own fiat currency notes (i.e., dollar bills).\\nDo your own research (DYOR)\\n\\nThe first step to investing in cryptocurrencies is doing your own research (DYOR). You should understand the technology and the market. Do not invest money that you cannot afford to lose, as cryptocurrency trading is highly risky and volatile. Choose cryptocurrencies with high market cap if you are a beginner and invest for long term.\\n\\nInvesting in cryptocurrencies requires caution, patience, and discipline. This article will help you understand more about cryptocurrencies so that you can make an informed decision when investing in them\\n\\nUse caution when investing\\n\\nThere are a few things to consider before committing your hard-earned money to cryptocurrency.\\n\\nFirst, you should know that many cryptocurrencies are volatile and risky investments. While they may have hit record highs in December 2017, it's possible that they'll see a steep decline. You could lose all of your money if you invest in cryptocurrency\\u2014and there's nothing anyone can do about it but warn others not to do the same thing.\\n\\nSecond, because most cryptocurrencies aren't backed by anything real (like gold), there's no way for them to become stable or reliable investments over time like stocks might be able to do if they were tied directly into an industry's profits or production costs (for example, oil companies sell their oil at higher prices). And finally: thirdly! In conclusion: That being said...\\n\\nChoose cryptocurrencies with high market cap\\n\\nWhen choosing cryptocurrencies to invest in, it is important to choose those with a high market cap. The higher the market cap, the more liquidity and stability you will have in your investment. If a cryptocurrency has a high market cap and is trading at $20 per coin, you know that there are hundreds of users who are looking at this coin as an investment opportunity.\\n\\nInvestment is a long term game\\n\\nWhen you invest in cryptocurrencies, you're not doing it for the short term. Instead, focus on the long-term growth of your investment. That's because the cryptocurrency market is volatile\\u2014meaning that prices can rise and fall rapidly\\u2014and it's best to look at a longer time period when investing in this space.\\n\\nThe best advice for anyone who wants to get started with cryptocurrency investing: buy and hold! That means putting your money into an exchangeable asset like bitcoin or Ethereum, then waiting for that currency\\u2019s value to increase over time before selling any portion back out into fiat (that\\u2019s what we call regular old non-crypto currencies). This strategy has been shown to be one of the most successful ways of investing in cryptocurrencies by people who have been doing it for years now\\u2014and it won't make you rich overnight but will give you solid returns if done right!\\n\\nCrypto markets are volatile, so be sure to invest with caution.\\n\\nCryptocurrencies are volatile. The cryptocurrency market is new and still developing, so it's more volatile than traditional markets and your investments can be at risk. While cryptocurrencies have the potential to yield high returns, they can also lose value quickly. Before you invest in any cryptocurrency, make sure that you fully understand all of its risks. If you are aware of what type of investment you want (long term or short term) and how much risk you're willing to take on, then go ahead and invest!\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nAt the end of the day, it\\u2019s important to keep in mind that cryptocurrencies are in their infancy and there are many unknowns. Invest with caution and only invest what you can afford to lose.\\n\\nThanks\\n\\nAshish\\n\\n(DM for collaboration)"}, {"upvote": 21, "content": "1.

The easy money was scooped out a long time ago and what remains is buried under the cryptographic equivalent of tons of hard rock.\\n\\nThe sad truth is:\\n\\nOnly those with specialised, high-powered machinery are able to profitably extract bitcoins nowadays. While mining is still technically possible for anyone, those with underpowered setups will find more money is spent on electricity than is generated through mining.\\n\\nIn other words, mining won\\u2019t be profitable at a small scale unless you have access to free or really cheap electriciy.\\n\\nWe\\u2019ll explain this situation in depth but first, you need to know a few basic technical terms from the world of Bitcoin mining:\\n\\nBlock:\\n\\nA group of Bitcoin transactions, chosen from the mempool (the list of all currently pending transactions) and recorded by a miner into the ever-growing record of blocks known as \\u201cthe blockchain.\\u201d\\n\\nA new block is created on average every ten minutes.\\n\\nProof of Work Hashing:\\n\\nThis is the cryptographic work which miners perform in order to find the solution which allows them to define a new block.\\n\\nPoW hashing ensures the proper function of the Bitcoin blockchain. Miners compete to solve a cryptographic \\u201cpuzzle,\\u201d known as a hash.\\n\\nThere are no shortcuts in this process, which can only be solved with raw computational power.\\n\\nBy correctly hashing the current block, miners prove their investment of work and are rewarded with a certain number of newly-created bitcoins.\\n\\nBlock Reward:\\n\\nThe number of newly-created bitcoins, awarded to whichever miner creates a block.\\n\\nThis number was initially set to 50, halved to 25 in late-2012, and halved again to 12.5 in mid-2016. The next halving event expected is around mid-2020.\\n\\nThis halving process will continue in this fashion, halving the block reward approximately every four years / 210,000 blocks, until all 21 million bitcoins are created.\\n\\nAchieving the block reward is the only valid way in which new bitcoins can be created; by miners according to the code\\u2019s rate and limit.\\n\\nHashrate:\\n\\nHashrate is the measure of a miner\\u2019s computational power.\\n\\nThe higher their relative power, the more solutions (and hence, block rewards) a miner is likely to find.\\n\\nInitially measured in hash per second (H/s), due to the increasing speed of mining hardware. H/s was soon commonly pre-fixed with SI units as follows:\\n\\n * Kilohash = KH/s (thousands of H/s), then\\n * Megahash = MH/s (millions of H/s), then\\n * Gigahash = GH/s (billions of H/s), then\\n * Terahash = TH/s (trillions of H/s), and even\\n * Petahash = PH/s (quadrillions of H/s).\\nIn early 2017, Bitcoin\\u2019s collective hashrate reached nearly 4 Exahash. This represents a tremendous investment into mining hardware, the R&D of such hardware, and electrical expenditure.\\n\\nDifficulty:\\n\\nWith hashrate shooting up over the years, it would seem blocks would be found by miners ever more rapidly.\\n\\nBitcoin\\u2019s Difficulty measure is what prevents this from happening. It adjusts to hashrate to ensure that blocks are found roughly every 10 minutes.\\n\\nNote how closely Difficulty matches Hashrate in the 2 charts above.\\n\\nWhen total hashrate rises, the Difficulty of POW hashing adjusts upwards \\u2013 and the inverse also applies.\\n\\nDifficulty auto-adjusts every two weeks (or 2016 blocks).\\n\\nBTC / XBT exchange rate:\\n\\nThe current fiat price of Bitcoin is critical for calculating profitability\\n\\nW/xHash/s:\\n\\nWatts per hashrate per second. Electricity is the major on-going cost of Bitcoin mining. The price paid per Watt will greatly influence profitability.\\n\\nMining Pool:\\n\\nUnless you command a tremendous hashrate, your odds of solving a block by yourself (i.e. \\u201csolo-mining\\u201d) are extremely low.\\n\\nBy banding together with other miners in a so-called pool, your combined odds of solving a block rise proportional to the pool\\u2019s total hashrate.\\n\\nWhenever they solve blocks, pools reward individual miners according to their contributed hashrate (minus commissions and the like).\\n\\nCalculating Mining Profitability\\n\\nWith these terms in mind, it\\u2019s possible to calculate the current profitability (circa March 2017) of Bitcoin mining for your circumstances.\\n\\nNote:\\n\\nThe future profitability of mining cannot be reliably predicted, mostly due to the changing Bitcoin price.\\n\\nThis is due to the ever-changing nature of the Difficulty modifier and the BTC price, in particular.\\n\\nTo begin, we must select a suitable ASIC mining rig. To aid in selection, the Bitcoin Wiki provides a handy mining hardware comparison:\\n\\nAlthough Bitcoin Wiki doesn\\u2019t list many models as currently shipping on from their manufacturers, all these mining rigs (and more) are available for resale as new or used.\\n\\nThe Bitmain AntMiner S9 is a modern mining rig which offers a good hashrate for its power consumption.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s pretty much the cutting edge of mining tech so we\\u2019ll select it for our example.\\n\\nThe S9 is available for roughly $1800 up to $2400 from Amazon, or about $1365 from BitMain, shipping excluded. Power supply units will add another $120 or so to the price.\\n\\nNext, we need to enter the S9\\u2019s specs and cost, as well as other info such as power cost and pool fees, into a suitable number-cruncher.\\n\\nCryptocurrency Mining vs. Bitcoin Mining Profitability offers a good mining profitability calculator, which automatically fills in the current BTC price, Difficulty and block reward info. Note that the Hardware Costs field does not seem to influence the final calculation.\\n\\nScenario 1: Big Chinese Miners\\n\\nWe are using the default power cost of 5c (USD), a likely rate for a Chinese industrial area or one in which electricity is subsidized.\\n\\nTo determine your own power cost, check worldwide electricity prices or your utility bill for the exact price.\\n\\nThe 0% Pool Fee assumes a mining farm large enough to run its own pool. Smaller pools will generally offer lower or even no fees, but keep in mind they will seldom find blocks.\\n\\nOnce all the necessary info is entered, hit Calculate for the profitability result:\\n\\nAn excellent result! At this rate, the S9 unit would pay for itself within a year as well as make about $600 in profit! As a large miner would be able to negotiate a lower unit price on each S9, we can assume they\\u2019ll research profit even sooner.\\n\\nScenario 2: An American Hobby Miner\\n\\nBefore getting too excited about your potential mining profits, let\\u2019s recalculate them using the average residential power cost per kWh in the USA (~12.5c) and a typical pool fee of 1%.\\n\\nThe result:\\n\\nIt\\u2019s not looking so great now.\\n\\nAt a Bitcoin price around $1150, it appears that the average American home miner makes only $1348 a year, assuming difficulty and price hold steady. In other words, the unit will pay for itself within a year.\\n\\nHowever:\\n\\nThis is a dangerous assumption! Bitcoin\\u2019s total hashrate \\u2013 and thus its difficulty, has been consistently rising since the early years, sometimes jumping by double digit percentages within a month!\\n\\nTherefore, any calculations should be regarded skeptically, as likely best-case scenarios.\\n\\nSources of Unexpected Profit Loss:\\n\\nDifficulty Spikes, Price Crashes, Equipment Failures, Power Cuts, Shipping Delays & More!\\n\\nOccasionally, Bitcoin hash rate spikes as a big new mining pool comes online. This happened in early 2016:\\n\\nIt\\u2019s quite possible that even some big, corporate miners found their profit margins under threat from the resulting steep spike in competition.

Cryptocurrencies tend to show wide changes in their prices over relatively short periods. It is risky \\u2013 but high profits are always sure, and such potential is hard to find in other assets.

When you keep your money in a bank, you are at the mercy of other people and organizations.

I was dependent on other entities for my fund's security as I didn\\u2019t hold any ownership of funds while using their staking and masternodes services.\\n\\nAlso used other decentralised wallets that had seed phrases but none of them offered staking and masternode solution without compromising ownership of funds.\\n\\nAll of my concerns and issues were resolved since the day, Divi wallet is launched.

As with conventional currency, you don\\u2019t need a wallet to spend your cash, but it certainly helps to keep it all in one place. When a user acquires cryptocurrency, such as bitcoins, she can store it in a cryptocurrency wallet and from there use it to make transactions.\\n\\nPLEASE NOTE: With the current bearish behaviour of all cryptocurrencies, many of us have fallen into fake cryptocurrency HYIP where you are promised double of your money in a short period of time and ignoring the few legitimately registered investment platforms like CRYPTOEXCHANGEFX, CRYPTOBROKER.STORE, etc due to that low return rate. This cryptocurrency scams are in no way helping the cryptocurrency world to grow and i won,t stop advocating for the future of cryptocurrency because i believe it is the future. Check out the few legit investment platforms i listed above on Google and thank me later for saving your asses for good.\\n\\nDeeper definition\\n\\nCryptocurrency wallets are apps just like those you might run on a smartphone or computer. If you prefer the tactile experience of holding a wallet, you can also buy a physical device that runs a wallet app.\\n\\nThe first cryptocurrency wallet was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto when he first released the bitcoin protocol in 2009. Bitcoin is the most popular and widely used cryptocurrency, but others building upon its blockchain technology have emerged, and any of them can be stored on a cryptocurrency wallet. Wallets can hold multiple cryptocurrencies.\\n\\nWhen you want to acquire cryptocurrency, whether by purchasing it in a currency exchange or receiving it as a gift or as revenue, you direct the sender to a unique cryptographic address issued by the wallet. You might picture your cryptocurrency stored on the wallet the same way files are stored on a USB drive, but, in fact, the information stored on the wallet only points to your cash\\u2019s location on the blockchain, the public ledger that records and authenticates all transactions for a cryptocurrency. Spending with the wallet is as simple as scanning a retailer\\u2019s QR code or directing a specific amount of cryptocoins to the retailer\\u2019s public address.\\n\\nSome economists warn that cryptocurrency makes for a lousy investment. You might be better off using Bankrate\\u2019s comparison of investment rates."}, {"upvote": 88, "content": "Owning a cryptocurrency can be a complex task in and out itself. And one of the crucial questions is what crypto wallet to use for this purpose.\\n\\nOn a bigger scale, there are two major ways to store your crypto assets.\\n\\nCustodial.\\n\\nIt assumes that you don\\u2019t have full ownership of your capital. Third parties like crypto exchanges or brokerage companies have control over your coins and tokens. If you want to extract them, you need to request a withdrawal. Basically, all of the popular crypto exchanges are custodial wallets.\\n\\nThere are a couple of drawbacks of custodial wallets:\\n\\n- Hot wallets. It means that your wallet should be connected to the internet to have the opportunity of interacting with it.\\n\\n- Higher risk of hacking. In the history of digital money, there were not so many hacking attacks. However, the bigger the size of the crypto exchange, the more your crypto assets are exposed to the risk of it.\\n\\n- Reliability of crypto exchange. Taking into account the recent events in the crypto market, this aspect should be considered seriously. With the crypto exchanges crashing one by one in the last several months, I don\\u2019t think they can be a viable option for crypto hodling. Especially if you have a substantial amount of coins.\\n\\nNoncustodial.\\n\\nThese wallets give users 100% control over their crypto assets through the private key solution. This key belongs to you only.\\n\\nNoncustodial wallets exist in two types:\\n\\na) Software. When the private keys are stored on the installed device. There are tons of them on the market, free or paid. They vary depending on the functionality, the number of supported coins, the level of security etc.\\n\\nThe main flaw of the noncustodial software wallets is the same as custodial ones. They are also hot storage wallets. Your private key is on a device that should be connected to the internet to carry out actions with your assets. Plus, it could be infected with some malicious software, like phishing software, to steal your private key.\\n\\nFor example, the Trust wallet is one of the best free options to vault crypto.\\n\\nTrust wallet is a free app for mobile devices. It supports over 160 thousand crypto assets across 40 different blockchains. On top of that, the Trust wallet allows you to get passive income from staking. The wallet is entirely open-source, so everyone can ensure the app's security. In the crypto community, it is a very good thing.\\n\\nb) Hardware. Unlike the various software wallets, hardware wallets are cold storage devices. These are small, single-purpose devices specifically made to store private keys and signing transactions. Since these devices are not connected to the internet, the only way to steal your crypto funds is to take over the device. Although even this won\\u2019t guarantee successful stealing. Because hardware wallets have multi-step defense mechanisms.\\n\\n- the simplest one is a several digits PIN code in the device itself;\\n\\n- as hardware wallets must be connected to the software on the PC. The developer can add extra protection like a cryptographic sign of the software to avoid the installment of the malware.\\n\\n- ultrasonic seal of the device\\u2019s case so that any breakage will completely ruin it;\\n\\n- additional passphrase support that is never stored on the device;\\n\\nOne of the primary disadvantages is that they are not free. The price of some can go up to several hundred dollars. So, if your crypto holdings are less than $5000, there is not much sense in buying it.\\n\\nSeveral companies offer hardware storage devices that you can choose based on your personal requirements. I can recommend the Ledger Nano X device.\\n\\nIt is the flagship of the Ledger Company based in France. In just five years, the Ledger devices became very popular in the crypto space. Its current price is $149, which is about $100 cheaper than its main rival Trezor Model T.\\n\\nfrom the security standpoint, Ledger Nano X has to offer:\\n\\ni) Secure Element. It\\u2019s a chip used in credit cards or passports that provides an extra security level to the device.\\n\\nii) BOLOS. The Ledger company has developed a custom operating system to have an additional layer of protection for the devices.\\n\\niii) Hardware components of the wallet exclude the glitching attacks.\\n\\nOn top of that, Ledger devices have the native staking feature. It means that none of the additional software installments are required. In comparison to the Trezor wallet, that needs the Exodus software wallet to enable staking.\\n\\nRegarding the downsides of the Ledger device, its firmware is closed source. So the crypto community cannot completely verify the solidity of the software.\\n\\nThe slight concerning fact about Ledger is the data breach that happened a couple of years ago.\\n\\nHowever, in fairness, it didn\\u2019t affect the security of the Ledger wallets. On the contrary, the Ledger Company made efforts to improve the safety of its database.\\n\\nConclusion.\\n\\nAs you can see, the crypto wallet sphere is filled with various options. Generally speaking, the selection of crypto wallets depends on these factors:\\n\\na) Size of crypto assets. There is not much sense in buying a hardware wallet with $100 worth of coins in your pocket.\\n\\nb) Functionality. Metamask software wallet, for instance, can only store Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens. Assets that are from the Ethereum network only.\\n\\nAnother example is the wallets to stake specific coins.\\n\\nc) The level of security that you\\u2019re striving for. Software or hardware, hot or cold, choose the one that you can tolerate.\\n\\nAs general recommendations, I can add the following:\\n\\n1. always check the software for malware;\\n\\n2. backup your seed words;\\n\\n3. use only the official websites of the wallets, whether it\\u2019s hardware or software;\\n\\n4. speech is silver, but silence is gold. Try to keep silent about the digital assets you have."}, {"upvote": 411, "content": "Which cryptocurrency wallet is the most trusted one?"}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-cryptocurrency-exchange-in-India", "question": "What is the best cryptocurrency exchange in India", "answers": [{"upvote": 1, "content": "Indian cryptocurrency exchanges are witnessing lower trading volume for the last 12 days.

Or are they going to crash and burn?\\n\\nInstead of telling you to invest in it or not, what I\\u2019m going to do is outline some facts about bitcoin as an investment and tell you about what happened with bubbles in the past. And then you can decide.\\n\\nFlashback no. 1\\n\\nThe Dot com bubble, 2000\\n\\nFueled by the rise of companies with a \\u201c.com\\u201d after their name, the \\u201c.com\\u201d bubble saw the price of the NASDAQ jump from 1000 to 5000 over 5 years. This was a 500% increase and was fueled by purely speculative investments.\\n\\nFundamentals were thrown away. People were rushing to buy any internet based company, ignoring the fact that these companies wouldn\\u2019t be making any money for the next few years. Money was cheap. Funding was easy. A bubble was formed.\\n\\nAnd like all bubbles, it burst in 2001. Companies that had a market capitalization of hundreds of millions were now worth 0. The stock market rapidly declined. Trillions of dollars of investors money was lost.\\n\\nFlashback no. 2\\n\\nThe housing bubble, 2006/2007\\n\\nAfter the recession the \\u201c.com\\u201d bubble caused, interest rates started to drop. Investors abandoned the stock market and turned to real estate. Lending requirements all but vanished. Housing prices started to go up. Speculators entered the market and made tens of thousands of dollars in weeks. A bubble was formed.\\n\\nAnd like all bubbles, it burst in 2007/2008 with the collapse of Lehmann Brothers, causing the largest recession in history since World War II. Millions of dollars were lost. Homes were destroyed. It took the economy years to recover.\\n\\nWhat is the definition of a \\u201cbubble\\u201d in finance?\\n\\nA \\u201cbubble\\u201d occurs when the price of a stock or investment is driven up to unsustainably high levels, substantially way more than what that item is worth. This bubble is usually caused by emotions of the masses, and not by logical investing or \\u201clooking at fundamentals\\u201d. And it always starts off as something that made sense in the beginning.\\n\\nIts exactly the same with Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin has jumped 18,749,900% since 2010. It made sense to invest in it a few years ago. It was secure, unregulated and cryptocurrency seems like the future. But does it make sense to invest in it now?\\n\\nYes, Bitcoin has its pros. It\\u2019s unregulated. Decentralized. Operates on Blockchain technology. But it\\u2019s also unregulated(see what I did there?). Has no intrinsic value. And it\\u2019s highly volatile.\\n\\nLook, I might even be wrong. There are people that have forecasted the price of Bitcoin to hit 100,000$ a coin in ten years.\\n\\nBut I\\u2019m going to stay out of it. Warren Buffett has warned against it.

Investing assumes holding a financial asset for profit purposes for a substantial time. It could be some financial assets that allow investors to get regular payments, like dividends, from it. There are a variety of investment instruments available to ordinary people nowadays.\\n\\nOnly three decades ago, the world of investments belonged to a higher caste of people. The trading process of financial entities was implemented by qualified traders only at special places like Wall Street, London Stock Exchange etc. With the development of the internet, financial markets became accessible to the general public. This proliferation can be ambiguous in the sense that the trading opportunity itself is a good thing. However, the level of traders\\u2019 expertise became relatively low. There is a spectrum of traders on one trading platform, from complete amateurs to high-level pros coexisting with each other. And the latter are outnumbered, as you may understand. This lack of knowledge can lead to false analysis conclusions and significant losses as a result.\\n\\nThe Internet brought us not only trading opportunities. The last decade was a decade of digital currency. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and thousands or maybe even hundreds of thousands of crypto coins, tokens, and NFTs emerged from nowhere. Some are complete scams, and some are born to vanish in oblivion. But there are definitely names worth our attention for the investing prospects.\\n\\nBitcoin and its investing capacity.\\n\\nCryptocurrency as an investment asset is very young compared to others, so its predictive potential is still unstable. From an investing point of view, Bitcoin is not a great instrument; it is too volatile. Also, the reason that limits the investments in Bitcoin is that the Bitcoin network has no scalability to it. It\\u2019s not going to expand into something bigger than just the Bitcoin transaction network.\\n\\nFor instance, if we take XRP, it is a coin of the Ripple payment network accepted by more than 100 financial institutions worldwide. Among them are:\\n\\n* Santander;\\n\\n* SBI Remit;\\n\\n* Credit Agricole;\\n\\n* Siam Commercial Bank;\\n\\n* SEB etc.\\n\\nSome say Bitcoin has a potential to be an alternative currency for the US economy in the future. Maybe, if we talk about decades, it is possible. Through all these decades, Bitcoin will rise and fall so many times. This is not very valuable for us as investors. For now, we need to establish what is the best strategy for dealing with Bitcoin. It can hardly be viewed as an investing tool, but it can be viable as a long-term trading instrument.\\n\\nThere will be a possibility to buy it in the near future at the lowest price in the prospect that it will grow to the all-time highs of November of 2021at the very least.\\n\\nThe thing is that every four years, so-called Bitcoin halving happening. What is this? Basically, it\\u2019s the control mechanism of cryptocurrency inflation by reducing the number of coins in the system.\\n\\nWhen you reduce the amount of some assets, it creates scarcity. Scarcity makes prices of this asset go up. Something like this will happen in the period of the upcoming two years. Next, Bitcoin halving is planned to occur in March of 2024. By that time, the current Bitcoin bearish market will end. We can expect the rise of Bitcoin and all the cryptocurrencies along with it. It\\u2019s no secret that literally all crypto coins and tokens, major or minor, are heavily correlated with Bitcoin price. According to the previous halvings price range, we can predict that the next Bitcoin halving will be followed by a Bitcoin take-off to the $100,000 price tag.\\n\\nThis strategy is not an investment in the broad sense. Trading assumes buying at the lows and selling at the highs. The next Bitcoin 4 year cycle will also consist of two indispensable parts: bullish and bearish.

The public key (comparable to a bank account number) serves as the address which is published to the world and to which others may send bitcoins. The private key (comparable to an ATM PIN) is meant to be a guarded secret and only used to authorize Bitcoin transmissions. Bitcoin keys should not be confused with a Bitcoin wallet, which is a physical or digital device which facilitates the trading of Bitcoin and allows users to track ownership of coins.

Blockchains - the digital networks crypto currencies operate on - have not developed sufficiently to provide the speed and volume necessary for the high the amount of transactions required for global money transfers.\\n \\n In this essay I will attempt to explain what Bitcoin and other crypto currencies are in an easy to understand manner. I will also propose that the reason crypto currency networks have not developed into a fast, high volume system capable of moving money efficiently is because of equity speculation. Bitcoin billionaires have inadvertently prevented the development of what the creators of Bitcoin initially envisioned: a global digital currency devoid of a central authority.\\n \\n If you wish to ride on a New York City subway, you might purchase a Metro Card.\\n\\nSimply pay for your Metro Card at an electronic kiosk and the machine will transfer the value of your money and digitally encode the value onto the Metro Card. Your Metro Card now digitally stores the value of your money until you spend it by boarding a train. Metro Cards have limited use. You cannot buy a cup of coffee with a Metro Card. However, in Bangkok, Thailand where I live, the Rabbit Card, Bangkok\\u2019s version of a Metro Card, can be used at a few merchants.\\n\\nBitcoin is similar to a Metro Card. An individual can purchase a Bitcoin (or a portion of a Bitcoin) and the value is noted on a digital network called a blockchain. Blockchains are unique in that they have solved a very difficult problem, how to prevent fraud and counterfeits. They do that basically with thousands of computers that monitor the blockchain. But unlike a Metro Card that has a fixed value, Bitcoin\\u2019s value is determined by an open market. The pioneers of Bitcoin acquired Bitcoins for pennies. Many of those early adopters of Bitcoin became billionaires when the price of Bitcoin soared in open market exchanges. While the early conversation about Bitcoin was how it could replace traditional currency as a method of transferring value, that changed.\\n\\nInvestors began buying Bitcoin and the focus, the narrative, became all about the value of Bitcoin. Stories abounded about the billions of dollars early investors made by buying Bitcoin. Demand for Bitcoins increased motivating technically savvy entrepreneurs to set up online exchanges or brokers. First dozens, now hundreds of other crypto-coins or tokens emerged. With billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin and other coins changing hands by way of blockchain technology, government finance oversight entities became interested and created regulations governing blockchain transactions. The original idea of an anonymous transaction between two parties became an afterthought.\\n \\n In 2017, I became aware of a surge in the price of Bitcoin in South Korea. Because of high local demand, eager South Korean speculators were paying 30% more for Bitcoin than in Bangkok where I live. When illogical price differences happen in a market, say the stock market, there is an opportunity for savvy traders to make a quick profit. Buy in the low market; sell in the high. It is a simple idea stock traders call arbitrage. At the time I knew little about Bitcoin. But this apparent arbitrage opportunity motivated me to learn about Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain network. \\n \\nSimply put, blockchain is a large collection of computers that monitor the blockchain system and double check transactions on that system. Those computers compete to be the computer that verifies the transaction. The successful computer, and its human maintainer, get a commission from the transaction.\\n\\nThere are ways to buy Bitcoin from an individual. Crypto enthusiast call transactions between individuals peer to peer. A person can install an app on their smartphone. By scanning a QR code of another person\\u2019s app, parties can transfer all or part of the value of a Bitcoin from one person to another, peer to peer. However, most holders of crypto currency I was meeting bought and sold their holdings through a central exchange such as Coinbase. \\n \\n What you are actually buying is a digital notation on the blockchain. All you receive is an identifying number. Do not loose it.\\n\\nThe key to success in an arbitrage transaction is execution. Arbitrage traders in the stock market work in specialized environments where intrenched market players can sometimes execute quick trades to exploit a market imbalance. While I was reading stories on social media about people profiting by making arbitrage trades with Bitcoin in South Korea, I realized quickly that I did not have the network necessary to execute such trades. \\n \\nExchanges such as Coinbase have cross border limitations and high fees. While I knew people in Bangkok from whom I could have executed a peer to peer purchase, in Korea, I would have to seek them out. And while that may not have been too difficult given the hot market, it takes six hours to fly from Bangkok to Seoul. \\n \\nThe price of Bitcoin, then and now, is volatile. Thirty percent price swings are common. I could buy Bitcoin in Bangkok and when I got off the plane in Seoul, my investment may have dropped dramatically in value while I was enjoying my expensive plane ride. I opted out of a Bitcoin arbitrage scheme, but became very interested in blockchain concepts, ideas and technology.\\n\\nLet me dispel one lingering myth about crypto-currency. Blockchain transactions are not untraceable or anonymous. The digital notations on the blockchain are public, a necessary element in the process of preventing duplicate transactions, fraud and counterfeits. These digital notations are identified by encrypted codes known only to the holders of the digital notations. But using AI data analysis and other surveillance, sophisticated parties can determine transaction sources when motivated to do so. If you want to purchase something and be truly untraceable and anonymous, use cash.\\n\\nThe volatility present in the crypto currency market is exacerbated by a feature first touted as a benefit of Bitcoin: there is a limited supply of Bitcoin, by design. The limit in supply theoretically prevents inflation. In the current volatile market of crypto currency, a construct such as inflation is not relevant. The value of goods and services rise, inflate, in relationship to a currency. A stable price has yet to be established from which its purchasing power would be deflated. If your crypto holdings go up and down dramatically, there is no logical way to determine an inflationary relationship with goods and services one might purchase with crypto.\\n\\nWhen a big holder of Bitcoin sells one hundred million dollars of their holdings, that one transaction will affect the price. The market will go down. If a currency trader of US dollars sold one hundred million dollars worth of the US dollar for English pounds, the currency market - measured in hundreds of billions of dollars a day - would not even register the transaction. The lack of depth in the Bitcoin market, its limited supply, adds to the volatile price swings.\\n\\nAnd here is where things get strange. The limited supply of Bitcoin, along with a cabal of early holders owning a significant proportion of the supply, creates an opportunity for market manipulation. Many of these early holders, called whales in the crypto orbit, accumulated large fortunes in the early rise of the value of Bitcoin. And they can easily make the market rise or fall by simply trading with themselves, a practice I have long suspected. Bloomberg News recently uncovered such an inside trade with a new blockchain product, non-fungible tokens, NFTs.\\n\\nNFTs are digital art works now becoming a trendy new use of blockchain. An NFT held by the Trump organization recently sold for over one million dollars. Bloomberg\\u2019s investigation showed the buyer was Melania Trump. The much heralded million dollar transaction falsely suggested there was a real market trading NFTs. While such a trade in US securities would be illegal, NFTs are not yet regulated. The Trump NFT transaction is legal. But it is also a clear indicator of how whales can manipulate the crypto market.\\n\\nBitcoin and other tokens have moved away from the original idea of a digital currency, or mechanism of exchange, to a simple store of value. Some early adopters are now paper billionaires. That kind of wealth is a magnet for others trying to get in on the new investment idea. Digital currencies, however, do not have any underlying value. The price of ownership of digital currencies has risen (and fallen) simply from demand. If the price dropped to zero, a distinct possibility according to many financiers such as Warren Buffet, holders of crypto currency would have nothing. By comparison, ownership of stocks means you have a share of a company. Even is the company went bankrupt, shareholders would get a share of the liquidation. Bonds have similar protections. While big looses are possible in stocks and bonds, holders of such instruments posses a portion of the tangible assets underlying those instruments. There are no tangible assets underlying crypto currency. Warren Buffett\\u2019s partner, Charlie Munger, is very vocal about his objection to idea of crypto currency. He believes the current value of crypto currency is nothing more than a speculative bubble that is bound to pop.\\n\\nIn The Netherlands, in 1637 the price of forward contracts on tulip bulbs , a contract to buy or sell in the future, rose to a very high price. Exuberant demand created history\\u2019s first recorded finance bubble. When the bubble popped, people holding the contracts went broke.\\n\\nIn 1929, a highly inflated stock market crashed in large part due to trading on margin. Margin trading is where stock holders borrow against their stock holdings. The bubble once again popped. Traders were jumping out windows.\\n\\nIn 2007, finance instruments called Credit Default Swaps (CDS) and Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDO) propped up global real estate markets. The value of CDOs and CDSs soared. Once again the bubble popped sending the world into the Great Recession.\\n\\nDid these finance catastrophes cause traders to discontinue buying and selling the offending finance instruments?\\n \\n Of course not!\\n \\n Margin trading is currently huge. CDSs and CDOs trade in trillions of dollars, and forward contracts on commodities are common. Additionally, when the tulip contracts crashed, the holders still had pretty flowers. The question to ask about crypto currency is if and when the speculative mania now dominating digital currencies goes away, will there be any underlying value?\\n\\nThe answer is a firm yes. But the value will not be in tangible assets such as real estate, company shares or tulips. It is the blockchain network itself that very well may transform the global movement of money.\\n\\nMook is a smart twenty-two year old Thai woman I met at a Bitcoin Cash meetup in Bangkok last year. Bitcoin Cash is a digital currency spinoff of Bitcoin. Mook and a few other young people were approaching local Bangkok merchants, mostly bars, restaurants and hotels and encouraging the proprietors to accept Bitcoin Cash as payment method. Mook and her entourage of good looking young folks would show the prospective merchants the ease with which they could download an app onto their smart phone and right away begin transferring value to and from other Bitcoin Cash holders. A resurgence of COVID closed Thailand to tourists and put a stop to Mook\\u2019s efforts. The ultimate users of Bitcoin Cash, Mook\\u2019s target consumers, were tourists. There are not many Thais buying crypto currency.\\n\\nMook confirmed her friends\\u2019 efforts promoting Bitcoin Cash were funded by Roger Ver, a Bitcoin Whale. Mook was quick to point out that she was not paid.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2026I\\u2019m not funded by Roger. I know some people that got funded by him but I just do it on my own\\\", declared Mook.\\n\\nRoger pivoted his focus away from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash and is now the man behind the curtain pulling the levers of promotion for Bitcoin Cash. From my observation of Mook and her crew\\u2019s efforts last year, the objective of this Roger Ver backed enterprise is indeed attempting to get Bitcoin Cash established as a usable currency in retail establishments. I am wondering though if there exist a natural tension between the holder of valuable equity and a functional crypto currency. They might be mutually exclusive states. If the market value of Bitcoin Cash drops dramatically and erodes a managing whale\\u2019s fortune, would that not shift their efforts toward maintaining their fortune?\\n\\nA year has passed since Mook and her Bitcoin Cash crew were promoting the use of crypto currency in Thai retail businesses. I had a long, pleasant conversation over coffee with Mook about her perspective on the use of crypto currency going forward. With impressive insight into finance realities, Mook wrapped up our conversation saying that she, and other middle class Thais, would never buy crypto currency as an investment. It is too volatile and risky. But Mook would use crypto currency as money if a fast, reliable network becomes available.\\n\\nAnother businessman I know well here in Bangkok has been working on developing cross border micro-payment systems using blockchain since 2014. This gentleman, let\\u2019s call him Stan, worked at high levels in the crypto-currency world until recently when he formed his own company. Stan was frustrated with how holders of crypto currency focused their attention on maintaining equity rather than developing payment networks. Now on his own with a few partners, Stan hopes to maintain that focus, getting the blockchain developed as a usable network rather than a speculation device. When I asked Stan if he thought the turmoil in the movement of money caused by the Ukraine crisis might be an interruption to the status quo that might change the path of blockchain development, Stan shrugged.\\n \\n Nobody knows the answer."}, {"upvote": 35, "content": "Currency is money. It has some value. It can be exchanged for goods and services. It can be used to maintain a record of the cost of these goods and services. Earlier we had Gold and other metals as currency. It was later replaced by Paper currency. Now we have Credit Cards.\\n\\nWhenever we give a bill or note (paper currency), the shopkeepers accepts it. They know that they can spend this money again to purchase from some one else. We carry this money in our wallets. We use it wherever we want too. We can use it in the middle of the night. The seller gets paid immediately.\\n\\nThen came credit cards and digital payments. Now you are ranked based upon a score. Banks track your every transaction. They may or may not allow you to do a particular transaction. Credit card companies hold up shopkeeper\\u2019s funds for months.\\n\\nSome people decided to create a new form of currency i.e Bitcoin. It is supposed to work as cash i.e. paper currency. Any person can create a wallet. He can load his wallets with Bitcoins and spend at his will. You can purchase it via Dollars, Rupees, Pounds, Yen etc. There is fluctuation in the price of USD/INR, USD/GBP and others depending upon a countries growth, demand for their currency, their expenditure etc. Similarly, the price of Bitcoin fluctuates with its development, adoption, innovation, and usage.\\n\\nSecond thing Satoshi Nakamoto wanted was to create a system where no bank or government can control Bitcoin. He achieved by making it decentralised. He published the paper about Bitcoin and asked people to help him with development. Like other open source softwares, developers update Bitcoins. These developers do not work for any body. They write code because they believe Bitcoin can change the world. Hundreds of different developers around the world write and review Bitcoin code and make it more secure and easy for people to use.\\n\\nBanks have their own centralised servers. They may maintain a copy of these servers in different places just to avoid any downtime. We have seen in past how these banks can be hacked and millions of Dollars are poured out of people\\u2019s accounts. In Bitcoin, the server is maintained by thousands of computers around the globes. These computers are owned by people like us. Each of these computers have a copy of ledger. The ledger has records of all the transactions that happened with Bitcoin. If somebody needs to hack the Bitcoin, he will have to hack all these computers at once.\\n\\nNow we have a system of unknown and unrelated people who want to transact with each other without the help of any third party. Someone needs to verify these transactions. There are miners which run huge servers for Bitcoin. The purpose of these servers is to verify each transaction and write it in the ledger. As this is an extensive process and requires a lot of computation power, miners get paid for verifying transactions.\\n\\nThere is no single person or group of persons who control the Bitcoins. There are many stakeholders. These are people like us. They want to see a new economic system in the world as they believe the current one is broken and outdated. These people do not know each other. They work because they believe in Bitcoins.\\n\\nLegality of Bitcoin is a topic of debate. Many countries recognise Bitcoin but they have not yet declared it as a legal payment method. Japan now identifies Bitcoin as a legal tender. We have Bitcoin ATMs in US, Singapore, Canada and Europe. We have strict Bitcoin rules in China. India is still not decided on its stance on Bitcoin.\\n\\nTLDR; Bitcoin is a digital cash. It works just like your online wallets. You can send money in your online wallet to your friends, buy stuff online and offline. It is completely online and works 24x7. Bitcoin was created by an anonymous person or group of persons known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Now a group of developers (mostly volunteers) and miners help run the network."}, {"upvote": 27, "content": " * Digital Currency: Bitcoin is the first of its kind digital currency (popularly called cryptocurrency), launched in January 2009.\\n * Underlying Technology & Transparency: There is no physical form of Bitcoin available. Its balance is kept on a decentralized public ledger (also called blockchain), which can be accessed by everyone, thereby providing unprecedented transparency. A massive amount of computing power verifies all Bitcoin transactions.\\n * Bitcoin: What you can do with it? You can:\\n * \\n * Create or mine Bitcoin\\n * Distribute Bitcoin\\n * Trade Bitcoin\\n * Store Bitcoin\\n\\n * What\\u2019s so Special?\\n * \\n * Absolutely Decentralized: The most exciting thing about Bitcoin (denoted as BTC) is that unlike government-issued currencies it is not issued or backed by any government or bank.\\n * High Popularity Despite being Legal Tenders: Though they are not legal tenders, they are very high in popularity among investors. It is the increasing popularity of Bitcoin that led to the launch of around 5,000 other altcoins.\\n * Lower Transaction Fees: BTC promises to lower transaction fees than any other traditional online payment mechanism.\\n\\n * Understanding Bitcoin in Simple Words\\nBitcoins are a collection of nodes (master nodes and simple nodes) that are nothing but computers. These computers run the code of Bitcoin and consequently store its blockchain.\\n\\nEach blockchain is a collection of blocks. Each block, in turn, is a collection of transactions. The best thing about this system is its transparency, making it unlikely for anyone (including those who started it) to cheat the system.\\n\\nAll the computers that run the blockchain have the same block and transaction list. Everyone (whether they run a \\u201cnode\\u201d or not) can see the new Bitcoin transactions occurring live and filling up the blocks one after the other. Cheating this system is unlikely.\\n\\nDoes that mean no one can cheat the Bitcoin System?\\n\\nIf a bad actor has to carry out a nefarious action, he/she has to operate 51% of the computing power that makes up the Bitcoin. As of May 2020, there are 47,000 nodes. Therefore, cheating this elaborate system is highly unlikely.\\n\\nNow, suppose a bad actor carries out an attack. In such a case, the people who are running the nodes or the computers will most probably carry out a fork to a new blockchain. This will make the attack a wastage of time, resources, and effort of the bad actor.\\n\\n * Should you invest in Bitcoin? Why?\\nAbsolutely. What are you waiting for? You should invest now because of the following reasons:\\n\\n * Outstanding Prospect of Growth in 2021\\nAlmost all analysts are predicting a bull run in 2021 as they are expecting the mass adoption of BTC in the near future.\\n\\n * Nexo co-founder Antoni Trenchev has said that by 2021-end, the Bitcoin price is expected to rise to $50,000.\\n * A respected on-chain analyst has said that one of his economic models a 10-time price appreciation to around $200,000-to-$300,000 by 2021-end or early 2022.\\n * Many analysts believe that the next most logical target is the US$24,800 Fib level (just below US$25,000).\\n * Phenomenal Performance in 2020\\nBitcoin price has increased by around 170% in 2020. If we consider the lows during the COVID-19 crash in March 2020, the bounceback is phenomenal. Since the lows of March, the BTC price against the US Dollar has increased by around 400%.\\n\\n * JPMorgan Analysts believe BTC will Present Itself as an Alternative to Gold in terms of Store of Value\\nA Bloomberg report says that the analysts of JPMorgan investment bank believe that BTC will continue to gain traction and may present a bear case for gold.\\n\\n\\u201cThe adoption of bitcoin by institutional investors has only begun, while for gold its adoption by institutional investors is very advanced.\\u201d\\n\\nBillions of dollars worth of investment can potentially flow from gold to Bitcoin. Therefore, in the coming time, the gold may lose its shine as BTC\\u2019s prospects brighten.\\n\\n * 62% Market Capitalization\\nOn December 10, 2020, the market cap of Bitcoin was US$341,785,729,235, out of the total global market capitalization of US$546,541,275,989. BTC\\u2019s market share is 62%, the highest in the cryptocurrency market. Its price movement largely defines the overall movement of the market.\\n\\n * Big Players are Investing Heavily\\n * \\n * Big-time investors such as BlackRock\\u2019s Rick Rieder, Paul Tudor Jones, Stanley Druckenmiller, and Bill Miller are parking more and more of their capital in Bitcoin and other altcoins.\\n * Payment companies such as PayPal and Square are continuing to funnel more retail capital into Bitcoin and other cryptos.\\n\\n * Big Players are Buying at Lows\\nUnlike 2017\\u2019s bear run (when the BTC value tanked to 3,500-level), this time it\\u2019ll be decent corrections. On December 9, 2020, the BTC/USD pair breached the US$18,000 level and moved downwards to US$17,640.56 and at one point in time exchange data showed buyer interest lined up at the US$16,200-level.\\n\\nWhen asked about the prospects of the Bitcoin market, Cointelegraph Markets analyst Micha\\u00ebl van de Poppe and many others said that their overall estimate is positive because many big investors including Grayscale, Paypal, Square, MicroStrategy, and many others are buying at lower levels as the small crypto \\u201ctraders, shitcoiners, and weak hands\\u201d sell-off.\\n\\nThey believe the downtrend will continue until the US$18,500-18,700 level is reclaimed. Currently, the BTC/USD price is revolving around US$18,022.35. So, time your entry by checking the technical charts and you\\u2019ll most definitely reap the benefit in the coming year.\\n\\n * Can I invest US$100 to buy Bitcoin?\\nYes, you can buy a portion of a single Bitcoin. However, always keep in mind that you\\u2019ve to give a certain commission for purchasing BTC. If you are paying US$10 for buying US$10,000 of Bitcoin, it means you are just paying 0.1% in fees. However, if you give US$10 fees for buying US$100 Bitcoin, you\\u2019re 10% in fees. While investing US$100, you should keep this thing in mind.

So many many years ago traders accepted gold/precious metals etc in exchange for the services they provided . So a medium of exchange for services was gold (i.e. Money) .\\n\\nBut there was a problem .As they frequently travelled far across the states for business , keeping those heavy chunks of gold/metals etc was quite a tough task and posed problems (like carrying the gold,managing it etc) .\\n\\nTo solve the above problem , it was thought out that instead of carrying actual gold , traders would deposit their gold in a third party which they trusted and get from them a piece of paper declaring that the piece of paper was worth the amount of gold they had deposited (i.e. Currency) . So for the piece of paper to be of worth ,the parties involved in exchange needed to trust the third party (i.e. Bank). This was called the the \\u2018Gold Standard\\u2019 where the piece of note actually meant that the same amount of gold was actually present in the bank and the parties could withdraw them from the bank using the paper .\\n\\nSo the value of the currency was the actual amount of gold inside the bank .Thats where the calue came from .\\n\\nThe Gold Standard was ended (meaning actual gold was not required) later and the currencies became fiat currency .Fiat currencies are the ones backed by the government of their resp countries and the value comes from the trust offered by the government .\\n\\nThe currencies however have a disadvantage that they can be regulated now and then by the Banks .eg. In India INR is regulated by RBI , similary for other currencies their resp countries central bank are responsible for the regulation .They can create new notes when and how they want (for various economic reasons).\\n\\nBitcoin is not regulated by any third party like bank , meaning it is decentralised(No third party has control over it) , Its a digital P2P - meaning Peer to Peer currency. This means every person in the world who has owned a bitcoin has a ledger (blockchain implementation) where he can verify the authenticity of every bitcoin and who were the owners previously(all transactions) . Digital meaning its created( or you say mining) by solving mathematical problems(basically hashes) on a computer that could consume electricity and more importantly time. There are a fixed no of bitcoins that can be mined (21 million) and already 16 million have been mined . But the process is such that the more you mine , the harder it is to mine the remaining . The estimate to mine last bitcoin is in 2140 . Yes thats true .\\n\\nBut where does the value of bitcoin comes from? - Its the trust of people on this currency and nothing else ."}, {"upvote": 94, "content": "Bitcoin is a form of electronic, permissionless, peer-to-peer money.\\n\\nWhat\\u2019s the idea behind it?\\n\\nThe idea behind digital money was to create a way to exchange value with the help of the internet. Doing it, people would be able to send and receive money worldwide feeless and without the friction of any intermediaries.\\n\\nAt first, Bitcoin solved the trust problem. Apart from the fact that people can transact money directly over the internet with no intermediaries involved, they can also participate in developing the network trying to make it more secure. Thus, Satoshi disappeared being confident that the development of the network would continue.\\n\\nOne of the unique features of BTC is the absence of the leader, as all changes are made through consensus among all network participants. The Bitcoin ecosystem has a large open source developer community, who contribute research, peer review, testing, documentation, and translation. Moreover, according to Electric Capital research conducted in Dec, 2020, it is expanding, having 70%+ more developers than it did 3 years ago.\\n\\nThough, Bitcoin has done a long way to its primary purpose.\\n\\nAt first, Bitcoin was traded for only a few cents and was mainly used for things like gambling.\\n\\nIn 2010, the first online crypto exchange Mt.

It caught the attention of early investors and speculators.\\n\\nNew cryptocurrencies were created to compete with BTC or solve other problems. They were called altcoins, as alternatives to Bitcoin.\\n\\nThough the FBI shut down the Silk Road in 2013, it showcased the promise of Bitcoin as a digital payment method.\\n\\nIn March 2014, Mt.Gox went bankrupt following a massive hack.\\n\\nDespite the closure of the Silk Road and the collapse of Mt. Gox the crypto space kept expanding.\\n\\nNow there are a lot of pro-crypto people and yet companies accepting Bitcoins, who believe that BTC can alter a global economy with digital money, changing it for the better.\\n\\n\\nHow does Bitcoin work?\\n\\nSince Bitcoin is decentralized, volunteers who are called \\\"miners\\\" constantly verify and update the blockchain. As soon as a specific amount of transactions are verified, another block is added to the blockchain.\\n\\nBTC's system rewards successful miners with bitcoins. The reward changes over time, halving about every four years. The current reward for a new block of verified transactions is 6.25 BTC. By reducing the rewards of mining bitcoin, halving ensures that the amount of bitcoin in circulation does not increase exponentially, which also tends to put upward pressure on its price.\\n\\nThe algorithm works like this: you create a transaction =%3E it is added to the network and sent to miners =%3E they confirm it =%3E your funds have successfully been sent.\\n\\nIs Bitcoin Legal?\\n\\nBitcoin ownership and mining are legal in more countries than not.

The Bitcoin white paper is not only considered the most seminal piece of work in the cryptocurrency movement, it also gave birth to a transformative technology called blockchain.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\udc46 It is interesting to know that he has never intended to invent a currency. In his announcement of Bitcoin in late 2008, Satoshi said that he developed \\\"A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\\\" only.\\n\\nOn 3rd Jan 2009, he mined the first block called \\\"Genesis\\\" with the text: \\\"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\\\"\\n\\nIt refers to a headline in The Times newspaper from the same date. It's possible that Nakamoto just picked the first headline he saw in the nearest paper. However, crypto enthusiasts tend to agree it's a statement of intent. The financial crisis of 2008 was still unraveling, and it's assumed that Bitcoin was a reaction to the widespread anger and frustration at the current financial system.\\n\\n9th Jan 2009, Nakamoto announced Bitcoin version 0.1 in his \\\"White Paper\\\" to the cryptography mailing list.\\n\\n12th Jan 2009: Nakamoto does the first Bitcoin transaction to Hal Finney, who was heavily involved in the community, advocating for the use of cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies.\\n\\nIn 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto officially stopped communicating.

We\\u2019ll have to stay tuned to see how it plays out into the future."}, {"upvote": 31, "content": "What is Bitcoin?\\n\\n * It is virtual money\\n * It is a means of payment\\n * It is a good store of value\\n * It is only usable via technological devices and the internet\\n * It is already acceptable by Virgin, Microsoft and soon by Starbucks\\nIn simplest terms, bitcoin is a currency just like the dollar, the Euro, and other traditional currencies. It can be used to buy goods and services, hold value, and do many other things a currency typically does.\\n\\nHowever, Bitcoin has no physical existence; it only has a digital existence. There are stark differences between bitcoin and other currencies. For instance, it lacks a central regulatory authority such as a central bank. Such radical issues initially made the currency get a lot of legal and political opposition in its first years of existence after it was introduced in 2009.\\n\\nThere are riveting benefits to this virtual currency such as greater transactional security, faster payments, and lower transaction costs have made its relevance in the modern financial world more apparent. This is why many countries now recognize the new-age currency and the groundbreaking technology on which it is based.\\n\\nHow does It Work?\\n\\nThere is a bit of confusion as to how bitcoin works. The process is quite simple.\\n\\nFirst of all, you should have a bitcoin wallet installed on your computer or mobile device so that you can have a Bitcoin address. You are free to have all the addresses you want. Anyway, with this address, you can make payments and receive payments in form of bitcoin.\\n\\nIt is more like email, but you get and send payments, not messages. The wallets also have a private key, also called a seed. This private key is used to sign the transactions in order to verify them as having originated from that particular wallet.\\n\\nTherefore, the transactions cannot be modified by anyone. These transactions are confirmed by computers in the network through a process called mining, and they are made part of the public ledger by being added to the blockchain.\\n\\nThe blockchain is a public ledger that details all the transactions that take place within the network. This system verifies all transactions independent of any single party, therefore ensuring security and transparency. This system is protected using cryptography.\\n\\nIs It Legal?\\n\\nThe answer to this question can be yes, no or undefined; depending on the country or region you are talking about.\\n\\nIn some countries, Bitcoin exists in a legal gray area, where it is neither legal or illegal. In others, there are laws that clearly give cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin a legal standing, allowing its use for commerce within the country.\\n\\nWhereas, in other countries, there are laws that clearly outlaw the use of this and other virtual currency. For instance, Bitcoin is legal in the USA and European Union as it is recognized as a currency. It is even subject to taxes that other currencies are subjected to when used in trade. The G7 has also given Bitcoin a legal status, although this comes with concerns that the currency may pose risks that regular currencies might not give their users.\\n\\nAt the same time, there are countries that have made laws that have made an absolute ban on the use of Bitcoin. Examples include Egypt, Bolivia, Saudi Arabia and others. In some countries, the ban is issued with regard to the use of this currency within the banking system, although it is legal for other financial situations.\\n\\nThese countries include Jordan, India, Thailand and others. In a country like Vietnam, it is legal to hold and trade in Bitcoin, but it is illegal to use it as a payment tool.\\n\\nIn other countries, Bitcoin is neither legal or illegal, and people use it without the risk of any legal consequences because there are no laws limiting or regulating its use. However, generally speaking, Bitcoin is legal in a majority of countries; and the number of countries that are lifting bans on its use continues to grow as the technology gains more acceptance in the mainstream financial world.\\n\\nWho Runs It?\\n\\nNobody runs bitcoin; or more accurately, all its have a say in how it operates. This is different from the way regular currencies are operated. With regular currencies, value, inflation, supply and so forth is often dictated by a central authority.\\n\\nBitcoin, computers around the world work together to create bitcoins, with the ultimate number of coins that will constitute the bitcoin network set at 21 million. Its value is also determined by the laws of supply and demand.\\n\\nHow Can You Participate in It?\\n\\nBeing a bitcoin user or trader is very easy. You can join a broker that offers bitcoin trading, open an account and fund it with fiat currency and then use these funds to trade bitcoin. Similarly, you can open a bitcoin wallet, put money in it using regular currency and then use this currency to buy bitcoins and hold it in your wallet.\\n\\nThe other option is using a cryptocurrency exchange, which can give you bitcoins in exchange for regular currency. You can then withdraw this money into your cryptocurrency wallet, where bitcoin and other virtual currencies can be held and used to trade, make payments and do everything else that pertains to the use of a currency.\\n\\nCan You Make Money with Bitcoin?\\n\\nYes, you can make money with Bitcoin, but this is highly subjective. If you know how to trade in currencies, then you can trade in bitcoin at various exchanges and make money as currency values around the world rise and fall.\\n\\nYou can also speculate on bitcoin\\u2019s future value and buy or sell units of the currency with the hope of making a profit in future when the trend you expected happens.\\n\\nHowever, just as with other financial assets, attempts to make a profit using Bitcoin come with risks of loss. So, make sure you know what you are doing as you try to make money through this virtual currency for you to actually turn a profit.\\n\\nHow Bitcoin (BTC), Cryptocurrency and Blockchain will Change Our Lives\\n\\nThe future of finance is believed to belong to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Banking institutions are already starting to embrace the blockchain technology on which these currencies are based as they offer a greater level of security during transactions. People will also take up the use of bitcoin more readily as it offers safer, faster, and a more globally accepted way of making and receiving payments in comparison to the traditional currencies.\\n\\nAs we speak, there are countries where residents are turning to bitcoin due to the instabilities the local currency offers due to political or economic issues facing them.\\n\\nAn example is Venezuela. This trend is likely to grow in future as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies exceed traditional currencies in acceptability around the world. Other sectors will change because of BTC and the blockchain technology as well. For instance, cloud storage services can use the encryption technology that blockchain systems use to ensure that data does not suffer any unauthorized modifications or access.\\n\\nEven with regard to Internet of Things (IoT), bitcoin and its seminal blockchain technology has something to offer in future. Currently, this system works with a centralized technology, which is susceptible to hacks and other security issues. However, by being decentralized and encrypted like blockchain technology, it will be much safer for everybody.\\n\\nSo yes, bitcoin and blockchain technology will change the future in a big way.\\n\\nOne to One Consulting:\\n\\nTo learn how you can personally participate in Bitcoin, ICOs and Cryptocurrencies: Call me on +44 (0)7932 394629\\n\\nTo learn more visit my courses on Udemy:\\n\\nCryptocurrency/Bitcoin - Made Easy (First Timer's Guide) Learn How Cryptocurrencies Work and How You Can Make Money & Get Involved In This New Movement\\n\\nThanks for reading this answer.\\n\\nGod bless you\\n\\nBoomy"}, {"upvote": 1158, "content": "Bitcoin is digital money that you can transfer to another person without the need of a third party, like a bank. It can be thought of as a digital equivalent of cash - it's just one person transferring value to another person, no bank involved. In fact, Bitcoins are not issued by a bank or government, so an even more apt analogy than cash might therefore be gold.\\n\\nOk, digital gold, got it. Weird. Why are people excited?\\n\\n1. Get rid of transaction costs\\n\\nUPDATE 2018\\u201301\\u201303: Bitcoin, due to various technical and political reasons, now has tremendously high transaction costs, several dollars per transaction. Bitcoins main competitor, Etherium [ https://www.ethereum.org/ ], is slightly better in this regard, but I\\u2019m personally banking on Stellar [ https://www.stellar.org/ ] which has very low transaction costs and is getting a lot of attention in recent months.\\n\\nBecause there is no central authority controlling the network, transactions costs are incredibly low compared to existing systems. Banks, card issuers and payment processors places a 1-5% transaction fee on that coffee you bought this morning, and everything else you buy. This is not very visible in everyday life, because it's almost always baked into the price of things, but if you start transferring money internationally with companies like Western Union, you realise that there is quite a bit of money in the business of transferring money.\\n\\n2. Take currency power away from banks and government\\n\\nBanks and government have the legal and physical ability to create money. I won't get into the details (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_creation) of how that works, but the main problem is that whenever money is created, it dilutes the value of everyone's money, which makes it a super-fast, completely silent, taxation.\\n\\nSometimes, governments and banks use this power responsibly, but sometimes, they do not. Lately, there has been a lot of the latter, with the Financial crisis of 2007\\u201308 [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late-2000s_financial_crisis ] caused by irresponsible lending, so a lot of people are starting to think that we probably are more reliant on banks and government that we want to be. An even more current example is Argentina, which has a 11% inflation (!) on its currency. Bitcoin is getting a strong hold there: BitPagos Uses Merchant Processing To Bring Bitcoin To Argentina [ http://thegenesisblock.com/bitpagos-uses-merchant-processing-bring-bitcoin-argentina/ ]\\n\\nHow does it work?\\n\\nBefore I go on, I'd like to point out that you probably don't know how your normal money works. Most people have no idea how money is transferred from one bank to another, or how it's created in the first place.\\n\\nWith that said, all Bitcoin transactions, from the beginning of time, are written down in an enormous, public ledger. When you transfer money from your Bitcoin wallet to another person, you do that by writing this transaction down in the public ledger. Everyone is watching this ledger and has their own copies of it, and so they now know that there is less money in your wallet, and more money in a friend's wallet. So everyone knows how much money each wallet contains. This is where your money is stored, in this public ledger with millions of copies that everyone maintains together. They do, however, not know who owns that wallet - Bitcoin has no notion of identity.\\n\\nSo what's preventing another person from transferring money from my wallet to their own?\\n\\nThis is where cryptography comes in. When your Bitcoin wallet is generated, it's given to you in two parts. One public part, an address, that you give to other people so that they know where to send you money, and a secret part, a key.\\n\\nThe key is used to \\\"sign\\\" transactions. It takes the amount, the sender address, receiver address, and the key, jumbles it together with math, and out comes a signature, that you put in the ledger along with the transactions. Due to how cryptography works, other people can mathematically verify that the person that generated this signature for this transaction must indeed have the key for this wallet. They can, however, not work backwards to what the key actually is - that would take a supercomputer thousands of years to do.\\n\\n\\nShameless plug: If you like my ramblings about programming on Quora, you might enjoy my YouTube show: Fun Fun Function [ https://youtube.com/funfunfunction ]"}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "Bitcoin is an electronic currency created in January 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto. It is used as electronic cash that allows users to send or receive cash through internet on the bitcoin blockchain network. Unlike dollars and euros, bitcoin is not owned by a country, indivisual or group which reduces chances of corruption and inflation.\\n\\nCan Bitcoin be used as a currency to buy or sell goods & services?\\n\\nBitcoin is now a widely used cryptocurrency for investment but still it can\\u2019t be used as a regular currency for buying and selling of goods and services because of it\\u2019s biggest drawback which is huge volatility. A seller will never sell his product by taking cryptocurrency as if he does the currency could fall drastically the very next day similarly a buyer will regret after purchasing a product with bitcoin or other crycurrencies as bitcoin could surge very high the very next day.\\n\\nIs this the right time to invest in Bitcoin?\\n\\nNow the most important question is that is this the correct time to invest in Bitcoin. Prices of Bitcoin falled drastically from $65000 in november 2021 to $24000 in august 2022 so the prices have more than halved from the peak. So the simple and genuine answer is if you believe in the future of bitcoin than it is the best time to invest in bitcoin as it is at a very low price comparatively and if you have made up your mind to buy Bitcoin than follow proper diversification, my advice is don\\u2019t put more than 5% of your portfolio in cryptocurrency. But if you don\\u2019t believe in future of Bitcoin than anytime to invest is a bad time for you so you can invest in stock market or other alternative markets.\\n\\nIf you want to learn to trade in cryptos click here [ https://www.digistore24.com/redir/340745/coolabhi300/ ]\\n\\nFuture of Bitcoin\\n\\nPositive aspect \\u2013 Bitcoin uses future proof blockchain technology that allows users to do cashless transactions through internet. The most important factor which is in favour of bitcoin is it\\u2019s track record of returns. It was valued at less than $1 10 years ago and today it priced around $24000 which are exceptional returns. Since the use of this bitcoin is increasing very fastly, many people will start using this technology for daily transaction which they were earlier doing with cash. Few countries have come forward to make the use of bitcoin as legal tender like El salvador and Central African Republic this move increases it\\u2019s acceptance among common people.\\n\\nNegative aspect \\u2013 The major drawback which was discussed earlier also, is it\\u2019s volatility. It\\u2019s acceptance is not possible among common people till the currency become stable like dollar or euros. Many governments will not allow the increase in usage of Bitcoin by increasing taxes on crypto or by directly banning it, as it will affect their local currency usage. Many countries already banned it totally like China, Russia, Turkey, Qatar, Bangladesh etc and many have restricted it\\u2019s usage by increasing taxes like India.\\n\\nGrowth of Bitcoin\\n\\nBitcoin is the highest return generating asset in the history of human kind in such short period. As you can see it was just near $0.09 in 2010 at the time of it\\u2019s launch and than the extraordinary story of growth began. During this period many investors made millions and many lost but if a person bought it in 2010 and hold it for such a long time than he must be a billionarie till now. So, you can agree or disagree with the use of Bitcoin but you can\\u2019t ignore the return which it had generated.\\n\\nMake money from bitcoin\\n\\nYou can make money from bitcoin not only from investment\\u2019s profit, but you can also earn money by Bitcoin mining. Many people around the world make their main source income from mining of bitcoin. There are many websites which allows people to mine bitcoin from their platform like Nicehash, hashing24, bemine etc. Many people have setup businesses whose core work is only mine bitcoins.

It looks to good to be true until i gave it a try and trust me it has been a smooth ride all the way. Don\\u2019t give up on cryptocurrency and join the platform. Trust me, you won\\u2019t care about the price fluctuation anymore. Thank me Later.\\n\\nNote: This is not in any case of me trying to lure you into anything for my own personal financial gain, i am just innocently sharing with you what works for me. You can also make a research on what works for you too.\\n\\nWith all that preamble over, let's dive into the steps involved in a smart bitcoin investment.\\n\\nStep 1: Choose a Crypto Exchange or Platform\\n\\nYour first step of course will be to choose where to buy your crypto.\\n\\nLike USD, bitcoin is the same no matter where you \\u201cwithdraw\\u201d it from. Therefore, your primary considerations will be safety, convenience and fees.\\n\\nWe've published a whole story on the best crypto exchanges, but to help narrow your search, here are my top three picks for beginners.\\n\\nFor Most Beginners: Coinbase\\n\\n * Pros: Extremely user-friendly; a publicly traded company; earn free crypto with Coinbase Learn.\\n * Cons: High trading fees; can't control wallet keys.\\nCoinbase is a household name for crypto buying for a reason. It's not only the first crypto exchange to go public; it's also the softest landing pad for crypto beginners.\\n\\nCoinbase knows that crypto investing can be a little intimidating, so it designed its buying process to be as streamlined as possible. You pretty much just sign up, attach a payment method and \\u2014 boom \\u2014 buy crypto like it's Amazon.\\n\\nPlus you can earn free crypto by watching short training videos on Coinbase Learn.\\n\\nCoinbase's Learn and Earn\\n\\nThe chief drawback to Coinbase is that it charges higher-than-average fees: up to $2.99 per transaction plus a spread fee of around 0.50% between purchase and sale prices.\\n\\nBut due to convenience, safety and customer service, many traders stick with Coinbase for the long haul.\\n\\nStep 2: Connect Your Bank Account to the Exchange\\n\\nStep 2 is pretty straightforward \\u2014 at some point, your chosen crypto exchange is going to ask you to connect a bank account as your primary payment method. Hand \\u2019em your bank account and routing numbers and you're good to go.\\n\\nAs simple as it is, Step 2 does raise a common question:\\n\\nCan I Buy Crypto With a Credit Card?\\n\\nIn most cases, no. In fact, Coinbase, like most crypto exchanges, won't even let you add a credit card.\\n\\nHere's why: Most banks treat crypto purchases like cash advances. Therefore, your bank will immediately charge you a cash-advance fee of 3% to 5% of the purchase amount. It also won't give you a grace period, meaning you'll accumulate high interest on your crypto purchase immediately. Heck, if the exchange isn't U.S. based, it'll even charge you a foreign transaction fee on top of everything else, just for good measure.\\n\\nBut banks don't mind wiring the money from your bank account to the exchange. The reason is simple: That's your money, not theirs.\\n\\nSo if you were hoping that your bitcoin investment would earn you some rewards points on the side, sorry to burst your bubble.\\n\\nStep 3: Place an Order\\n\\nNow that you've registered for an account and attached your bank account, it's finally time to buy some bitcoin!\\n\\nOn most exchanges, you're never more than a click or two away from buying bitcoin. Click the big Buy/Sell button and you'll be brought to a page like this one from Coinbase:\\n\\nCoinbase's Buy Window\\n\\nNext question: How much should you buy?\\n\\nWell, this article is more of a how to than a how much. But since we're here, I will say this to help you come up with an initial purchase amount:\\n\\n1. Re-familiarize yourself with the \\u201cBefore Investing\\u201d section above.\\n2. Determine your risk tolerance.\\n3. Speak to your wealth advisor (or consider getting one) to determine how much of your portfolio you should dedicate to very-high-risk investments.\\n4. Start small \\u2014 Put in a small fraction of a paycheck and watch how it performs over time.\\n5. Finally, don't worry about purchasing round numbers (like 1 BTC for $50,000) since exchanges support partial coins.\\nIf you're getting cold feet, remember that you can always earn free crypto, risk free, through Coinbase Learn or from bitcoin mining."}, {"upvote": 68, "content": "You do that from an exchange site or peer to peer.

Trading platforms allow customers to purchase cryptocurrencies in their local currency and you can usually pay using a credit card, Paypal, and bank wire depending on the exchange in question.\\n\\nExchanges will also require identification and will want to verify your identity in some fashion.

However, you might still want a separate digital wallet because the cryptocurrency will be secure if hackers ever break into Coinbase. The exchange charges a base rate of 4% before waivers, which means the actual rate paid is less. The company waives part of the transaction fee based on what payment method you use. For example, Coinbase charges a 1.49% rate on bank account and Coinbase USD wallet conversions after the waiver. The company charges 3.99% on debit card or PayPal conversions and up to 1.5% on instant card withdrawals, with a minimum fee of 55 cents. The exchange is a good choice for beginners because the interface is simple, and there are limited transaction types.\\n\\nBinance.US | Buy & Sell Crypto [ http://Binance.US ]\\n\\nBinance is harder to use than Coinbase, and there is a steep learning curve with it. Binance's platform is user-friendly and offers three levels organized by trading experience, although it is still more difficult to use than Coinbase. Binance lacks a built-in digital wallet as well. The exchange charges 3% to 4.5% for debit or credit card transactions, although ACH transfers are free. Wire transfers are $15, while purchases are 0.02% to 0.1%. Trades are charged at the same rate. There is also an instant buy and sell fee of 0.5%.\\n\\nGemini\\n\\nThis crypto exchange offers site insurance to protect users' digital assets against hacks on the exchange. Gemini [ https://www.gemini.com/ ] offers products for both beginner and advanced cryptocurrency investors. There's a simple interface for new investors, while its ActiveTrader platform is designed for advanced investors.

Coinmama [ https://www.coinmama.com/?locale=en ] offers a variety of payment options, including using Visa or Mastercard for transactions. The exchange differs from other exchanges because it doesn't facilitate crypto transactions between two other parties. Instead, it sells bitcoin from its own inventory. Additionally, the company doesn't provide a digital wallet. Coinmama requires a $50 minimum to buy cryptocurrency and a $200 minimum to sell. Trading fees amount to the market rate plus 2% to buy and the market rate plus up to 0.9% to sell. Transaction fees are up to 3.9% on purchases, plus 5% for credit and debit card transactions.\\n\\nSome traditional brokers also offer cryptocurrency trading, including:\\n\\nRobinhood\\n\\nRobinhood is an online brokerage, and it offers bitcoin transactions in a way that brokers offer stock trades. In other words, you can enter different order types for your bitcoin trades, just as you do with stocks. For example, market orders are executed immediately, although Robinhood limits orders so that bitcoin won't sell if the price falls more than 5% than what it was at the time you placed your market sell order or increases more than 1% from when you placed to buy order. This helps protect against volatility, which crypto exchanges do not. Unfortunately, you can't withdraw bitcoin from Robinhood, which you can do with exchanges, although you can sell bitcoin at Robinhood. The company doesn't charge any commission on transactions, instead making money through a pay-order-flow fee that varies according to trade. Robinhood also supports margin trading, which means you can borrow money to buy bitcoin. It charges interest on accounts that trade on margin.\\n\\neToro\\n\\neToro is also an online brokerage, so it offers charts and analysis tools similar to those it offers for stock trading on its platform. Unlike Robinhood, it's a social trading platform that lets you see what other high-profile investors are doing with their bitcoin. You can also copy what they are doing with eToro's CopyTrader. The brokerage also offers practice accounts for those who want to learn how to invest in bitcoin without actually putting any money into it at first. eToro also offers a digital wallet. The company doesn't charge any deposit or trading fees other than spreads. There is also a $5 fee for withdrawals with a minimum amount of $50. Trades on eToro are conducted in U.S. dollars, so there is a conversion fee on withdrawing or depositing in a foreign currency."}, {"upvote": 46, "content": "Ways to buy bitcoin\\n\\nBuying bitcoin with the http://Bitcoin.com Wallet.\\n\\nBuying bitcoin from the http://Bitcoin.com website.\\n\\nBuying bitcoin from a centralized cryptocurrency exchange.\\n\\nBuying bitcoin using a peer-to-peer trading platform.\\n\\nBuying bitcoin cash using our peer-to-peer trading platform."}, {"upvote": 5, "content": "The smart ones don\\u2019t."}, {"upvote": 38, "content": "I always say that if you are American the best way to buy Bitcoin is with Coinbase or Gemini but if you live outside the USA you should use OKEx: Bitcoin Exchange | BTC Exchange | Crypto Exchange | Cryptocurrency Exchange [ https://www.okex.com/?channelFlag=ACEAP1502019 ].\\n\\nOKEx has a lot of advantages for the international community who are buying Bitcoin.\\n\\n * OKEx is available in over 30 languages so there is a good chance the platform is in your native tongue.\\n * OKEx allows several different fiat currencies to be used to purchase Bitcoin.

For example, don\\u2019t store cash under your mattress else it might get stolen, or don\\u2019t trust your money with strangers.\\n\\nBitcoin also has some fairly unique risks: for one, it\\u2019s a brand new technology, and while it appears very secure and robust, there is always a chance that it might fail. That is also a reason why you should never put \\u2018all your eggs in one basket\\u2019 and never buy more Bitcoin than you can afford to lose.

I run a small mine as an educational hobby in my garage. Using equipment purchased in 2014, I am currently running at 6,106 GH/s. This means on average I mine 0.04952418 BTC per day, using 5,442 watts of power. My marginal electricity cost is USD $0.1139 per kWh, so at the current (at the moment) bitcoin price of $380.99, I am making a profit of $3.99 per day. The reason I call it an educational hobby, however, is that the total return on the project since September, 2013, is -27.2 percent if I turned everything into dollars today. I keep the bitcoin I mine in bitcoin, because only an increase in the value of bitcoin could make the project profitable overall. My expenses so far are 72% equipment and 28% electricity, but of course that puts no value on the (large) amount of time I spent working on this. I've learned an amazing amount about bitcoin in the process, so I consider it a win either way.\\n\\nNow that you can invest hugely on Power-Miner Startup Lab (www.power-miner.store) where you can get daily profit off your bitcoin investments for as long as 6 months through mining and daily trading, then life is getting better for Bitcoin investors now. Thanks to the world cryptocurrency leaders for bringing in other options of earning cryptocurrency\\n\\nUpdate December 29, 2015: Bitcoin mining difficulty has increased significantly, the worldwide network is now making 786 quadrillion mining guesses per second. I am now mining 0.03299220 BTC per day, my marginal electricity cost has risen to USD $0.1152 per kWh, and at the current bitcoin price of USD $430.73, I am currently overpaying for the bitcoins I mine to the tune of USD $0.85 per day. My mine uses USD $455.56 worth of electricity to mine one bitcoin. On the other hand, the garage keeps the rest of the house warm in winter, so it's roughly a break-even operation for the time being. The overall operation would be -16.8 percent if I turned everything into dollars today, expenses so far are 70% equipment and 30% electricity. If bitcoin prices rise to USD $518 then I'm in the black.\\n\\nUpdate January 10, 2016: Rising bitcoin mining difficulty is taking its toll. Mining 0.02967912 BTC per day, but it costs USD $15.08 in electricity per day to operate the mine, so my effective BTC cost is USD $508.10. With the current market price of BTC at USD $440, it doesn't make sense to run much longer unless bitcoin prices rise. The whole project is -14.9% if I stopped right now and turned everything back into USD. The upside is that my hobby has returned 85.1% of its costs. Adding some pictures of the effort.\\n\\nUpdate June 11, 2016: Current mining operation is running at a loss, but whole project is now 11.6% in the black. Cost of electricity now $0.12 per kWh, mining 0.016 BTC per day but at an effective cost of $997 per BTC. Will run until the halving of the block reward next month, then take everything apart. Overall expenses so far 65% equipment, 35% electricity. Looks like my hobby paid for itself if I want it to, but so far I have not sold any of the bitcoin that I mined.\\n\\nUpdate October 25, 2016: My sons and I had a blast taking everything apart and recycling all of the metal, and I guess I never need to buy another fan.

Of course a lot of people saw BTC hit ATH and probably thought it would keep going \\u201cTO THE MOON\\u201d.\\n\\nThe Result?\\n\\nA lot of people that were initially skeptical of buying BTC during the entire bull run(Perhaps due to paranoia over a past failed investment decision) and saw it hit another ATH while their friends and all of social media seemed to be profiting from the move.\\n\\nFOMO sets in, they join in to buy! A lot of un-informed traders also buy BTC at ATH due to the fear of missing out in case it \\u201cGoes to the moon\\u201d and hit $178k or $1m like some very ambitious YouTubers were calling.\\n\\nMe knowing all of that, also knowing that the general retail traders are usually wrong 90% of the time.. I have automatically conditioned myself over the years to always think the opposite of what the general public is doing, and think like the people making the markets.\\n\\nThen i asked myself,\\n\\n\\u201cIf i was a seller in control of supply in this market, knowing that a lot of people would be willing to buy all of my supplies at premium prices, what would i do?\\u201d I\\u2019d definitely sell most of the positions i accumulated at discount\\u201d\\n\\nSo i anticipated this move instead.\\n\\nThen i waited for price to show its hand, which it did by by doing this.\\n\\nFrom here..

Start earning today!\\n\\nWhat is cryptocurrency?\\n\\nCryptocurrency is digital currency that is not backed by any central bank. It's decentralized, meaning no one person controls it. It uses cryptography to secure transactions and control the creation of new units of currency. Cryptocurrencies can be used to purchase goods and services, but they are also traded on exchanges like stocks. The price of cryptocurrency varies with supply and demand. The more people who want to buy or sell at any given time, the higher its price will go. If there aren't enough buyers at a certain price level, sellers might lower their asking prices to unload coins quicker. Bitcoin was the first type of cryptocurrency created in 2009 by an unknown programmer named Satoshi Nakamoto. As opposed to traditional currencies such as the U.S. dollar or euro, bitcoin doesn\\u2019t have a centralized governing body such as a country\\u2019s central bank regulating it. Bitcoins are created as payments for validating transactions for those using other forms of cryptocurrency.\\n\\nInvesting in cryptocurrency\\n\\nThe process of investing in cryptocurrency can be overwhelming at first, but it's not too hard to get started. You'll need to start by setting up an account on Coinbase. Once you have a Coinbase account, you can transfer funds from your bank account and buy bitcoin (BTC). Next, send the bitcoin to your personal wallet (e.g. myetherwallet) and store it there until you're ready to use it for investment purposes or trade with another party.\\n\\n1. Register on Coinbase\\n\\n2. Transfer funds\\n\\n3. Buy BTC\\n\\n4. Send BTC to personal wallet\\n\\n5. Keep funds stored in personal wallet\\n\\n6. Trade BTC 7. When you want to trade bitcoin, log back into Coinbase\\n\\n8. Select Accounts and then Send\\n\\n9. Select Bitcoin\\n\\n10. Enter the recipient address\\n\\n11. Enter the amount\\n\\n12. Verify everything is correct\\n\\n13. Select Pay\\n\\n14. Review\\n\\n15. A confirmation email will be sent to both parties 16. After about one hour, the bitcoin will show as confirmed in both wallets . At this point, the sender has successfully transferred ownership of their bitcoin to the receiver. Now that you know how to purchase Bitcoin, let's talk about how to invest with them! To invest in cryptocurrencies, you'll need a digital wallet and some spare cash. I recommend buying some Ethereum and keeping it secure in your digital wallet until there are good investment opportunities (e.g., when prices are low).

The easiest way to do so is by joining an online service called CoinPot. CoinPot includes over 40 different coins, including Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), and Dogecoin (DOGE).

That means that if you mine 100 DOGE, CoinPot will credit your account with 10 DOGE. It\\u2019s as easy as that! Another option would be to invest in bitcoin mining equipment such as ASIC miners or cloud mining contracts through companies like Hashflare or Genesis Mining. These provide more than just bitcoins; many also produce other altcoins like Ethereum, Dash, Monero and Zcash. There are three ways to mine Bitcoin. First is solo mining which entails using computer resources and applying brute force to find Bitcoins on its own \\u2013 this can take a long time to generate any significant income. Second is pool mining which means working together with others in a pool where the reward can vary depending on how much work has been done by each miner but on average generates around 1 BTC per month - however there are hidden costs associated with running hardware 24/7 which may not make it profitable.\\n\\nTrading cryptocurrency for profit\\n\\nThe easiest way to trade cryptocurrency is through an online exchange, such as Coinbase. Once you have opened your account and connected it to your bank account, you can start buying and selling currencies. It\\u2019s important to note that the price of Bitcoin will fluctuate constantly, so don\\u2019t go in with all of your savings! If you want to trade cryptocurrency for profit, make sure you are constantly monitoring the market for opportunities. For example, if you notice that one currency has been dropping steadily over a few days but another has been slowly rising then this could be a good opportunity to buy into the latter currency. You may not get rich quick with this method, but if done right it can lead to some decent profits over time.\\n\\nCheck Out How To Get Rich With Bitcoin Even If You Have No Clue About Technology.

Once a transaction is confirmed on the Blockchain, there is no way to reverse it.\\n\\nBeware of \\u201cBitcoin recovery\\u201d scams\\n\\nThere are many \\u201cBitcoin recovery\\u201d services that claim to be able to return stolen Bitcoin. They will have all kinds of explanations of how they do this.\\n\\nHere is a debunking of the most common recovery methods:\\n\\nLawyers:\\n\\nWhat they promise: we will prosecute thieves and force them to return stolen Bitcoin\\n\\nWhy it won\\u2019t work:\\n\\nIn almost all cases, you won\\u2019t know the identity of the people who stole your Bitcoin. It\\u2019s nearly impossible to find out the real-world identity of the owner of a given Bitcoin address.\\n\\nEven if you have a name, email address, \\u201cregistered trading account,\\u201d website, etc, it will be very difficult to obtain the cooperation of the police in getting their real-world identity.\\n\\nThe police don\\u2019t care about \\u201csmall-scale\\u201d theft. In most cases, the thieves will be in a different country than you. Furthermore, unlike cash, there is no paper trail to follow. Bitcoin/cryptocurrency is generally considered \\u201cproperty\\u201d rather than money, and hacking isn\\u2019t given the same weight as theft of physical goods. All of this makes authorities unlikely to pursue cases.\\n\\nHe\\u2019s lying. Binance does not have bank accounts all over, and they have never returned a deposit of scammed funds.\\n\\nEven when the identity of the thieves is definitely known, the Bitcoin is rarely returned. The only cases where Bitcoin has been recovered in theft has been in a class-action lawsuit (such as with Mt Gox). Even then, it usually takes thousands of victims, at least tens of millions of dollars stolen, expensive attorneys, and many years.\\n\\nI\\u2019m not saying it\\u2019s impossible. Just don\\u2019t expect to send a random lawyer $5000-$10,000 (typical \\u201crecovery\\u201d fees) and anything useful to happen. It\\u2019s a scam.\\n\\n\\u201cEthical hackers\\u201d\\n\\nWhat they promise: we will hack the thieves and get them to return your Bitcoin.\\n\\nWhy it won\\u2019t work:\\n\\nFirst, anyone who was able to steal your money is already a sophisticated hacker. Most \\u201chackers\\u201d prey on the technologically ignorant. Anyone capable of stealing your Bitcoin probably knows the tricks of so-called \\u201cethical hackers\\u201d.\\n\\nSecond, it\\u2019s nearly impossible to find out the real-world identity from a Bitcoin address or an email address. If the U.S. government struggles to find find out who operates darknet markets, what hope has some hacker you paid $1000?\\n\\nThird, even an \\u201cethical hacker\\u201d has to break into someone else\\u2019s systems \\u2014 and probably break some laws in the process. If they could someone break into people\\u2019s computers to get their Bitcoin, why should they return it to you? Why do they need you at all? If they can hack people\\u2019s computers to steal Bitcoin, they are just as likely to steal yours.\\n\\nThere are no credible, independent reports of anyone successfully doing this. \\u201cEthical hackers\\u201d that return Bitcoin for cash upfront simply do not exist. It\\u2019s a scam.\\n\\nBlockchain hackers\\n\\nWhat they promise: we will hack Bitcoin or brute force your private key to reverse the transaction and return your Bitcoin.\\n\\nWhy it won\\u2019t work:\\n\\nThe market cap of Bitcoin is nearly $700 billion dollars. Every single Bitcoin transaction and address is public. If someone could steal or reverse a Bitcoin transaction, they wouldn\\u2019t be helping you. They would be going after the richest Bitcoin wallets worth tens of billions of dollars. [ https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin/rich-list/ ] Of course, once it got out that Bitcoin could be hacked, the exploit would either be patched, or Bitcoin would become worthless.\\n\\nNo matter how brilliant they claim to be, it\\u2019s a scam.\\n\\nChainalysis\\n\\nWhat they claim: we will trace Bitcoin transaction to the service holding them, and force them to return your money.\\n\\nWhy it won\\u2019t work:\\n\\nChainalysis is a real thing. There are companies [ https://www.chainalysis.com/ ] that keep databases of addresses used by criminals and gambling sites, and help exchanges ban those customers. Unfortunately, they can\\u2019t help you for a few reasons:\\n\\nFirst, they have expensive products for businesses and governments than the random recovery service you found online probably doesn\\u2019t have access to.\\n\\nSecond, the most they can do is trace which major exchange or business got your Bitcoin. At this point, you would need the cooperation of the exchange to tell you which customer made that deposit. That cooperation is impossible to obtain without a court order, which as previously explained is nearly impossible to obtain. Furthermore, thieves don\\u2019t use cooperative exchanges in the first place, since they require KYC.  [ https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Know_your_customer ]If they want to cash out, they are going to use some less-reputable service in a country that probably does not cooperate with your government.\\n\\nThird, once your crypto hits an exchange, it\\u2019s impossible to trace what a given customer does with it next. If someone simply deposits Bitcoin with an exchange, you will never know when they take it out or move it. This is because exchanges combine all their funds, so your stolen Bitcoin will be given to whoever requests a withdrawal first. It will not be withdrawn by the person who deposited it.\\n\\nFourth, criminals don\\u2019t keep Bitcoin at exchanges. In my experience, they will either sit on it for years or cash it out immediately. They are not stupid enough to keep it where it can be confiscated, however unlikely that is.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s a scam.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nIt is nearly impossible to return your stolen cryptocurrency.
