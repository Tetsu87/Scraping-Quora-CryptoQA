Our Dogecoin price prediction is based on extensive technical research and Dogecoin's historical performance. In this section, we shall attempt to assess Dogecoin's long-term prospects.  Dogecoin (DOGE) is now the top meme currency in terms of market cap and popularity. Dogecoin is based on the popular dog meme and is supported by Litecoin variants. The Shiba Inu dog serves as the emblem for Dogecoin. The makers of Dogecoin created this joke coin for fun, but the market took the idea seriously. Tesla CEO Elon Musk was instrumental in the rise of Dogecoin.  Dogecoin is now accepted by numerous companies, giving the token genuine worth. Dogecoin is the only meme coin that is available on nearly every marketplace. According to CoinMarketCap, Dogecoin has a total quantity of 132,670,764,300 DOGE coins. With a restricted token supply and a positive response from investors, Dogecoin appears to be a long-term winner.  DOGE's performance has been gradual for a long period after a huge rise in the beginning of 2021. Dogecoin has provided a fantastic return to its early investors. However, Dogecoin's value fell by 81% in January-May 2021, Dogecoin prices reached an all-time high (ATH) of $0.73. Since the Dogecoin prices have been declining.  Dogecoin is the market's most popular meme coin. Many platforms and analysts believe that the price of Dogecoin will continue to rise over the following five years, eventually topping $1 by the end of 2025. Dogecoin's performance has been slowing as other cryptos have been declining since December 2021. There is a good chance that the Dogecoin bull market will resume in the middle of 2022.  If present market growth continues, Dogecoin might reach a maximum price of $0.25 in 2022. With cryptos doing poorly, it will be difficult for Doge to surpass its previous high this year. However, the average price of Dogecoin in 2022 is expected to be about $0.17. In addition, if there is a negative trend, the minimum price of a Dogecoin might go as low as $0.089. A bull rally is forecast in 2022, and if it occurs, the Dogecoin price may rise much higher than our Doge price estimate.  The detail information about the dogecoin future is predicted in the following post:  https://enfoticle.com/dogecoin-price-prediction-2022-2025-2030-2040-2050/ The post has shown all the prediction for the upcoming years until 2050, which might become true it things goes only the way we predicted.  If you plan to own Dogecoin for a long time, it has a lot of potential. The year 2050 may conclude with an average price of $63.89, while Dogecoin's minimum price value may be at $55.68.  Along with Dogecoin, several other cryptocurrencies may set new all-time highs this year. The highest possible price is projected to be about $72.87. If there is a bull market in 2050, the price of Dogecoin may rise and exceed our projection."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "Dogecoin remains a significant contributor to the investment platform's transaction-based cryptocurrency revenue.  DOGE accounted for 40% of the $50.7 million in transaction-based cryptocurrency revenues in the third quarter. Overall, that's $20.3 million out of $266.8 million in transaction-based revenue from crypto, options, equities, and other products.  So, in Q3 2021, Dogecoin accounted for 8% of transaction-based revenue, compared to 32% in Q2 2021 and 7% in Q1 2021.  The unpredictability of Dogecoin's revenue generation on Robinhood is significant, so you can see why HOOD stock has struggled for most of its short life as a public company.  However, Dogecoin investors should also be concerned.

The coin's volatility is often driven by social media, where there are currently expectations that the price could climb further to reach $1.  Dogecoin price prediction: will the coin keep climbing?  Dogecoin is in an uptrend driven by celebrity endorsements and acceptance at major companies. There is resistance at $0.50 and then $1, which it could reach before the end of July. After $1, the next resistance level is $10.  Personally, I forecasts that the Dogecoin future price will move up to $2 at the end of 2022, reach over $10 by the end of 2023 and hit $15 by December 2025. Aside just buying and holding dogecoins, I also recommend that investors look into investing in companies like the Coinpaq (www.coinpaq.tech), a service company where investors can leverage substantial returns(profits) with their investments over time.  Digitalcoin is more bullish on Dogecoin's future value, predicting the price will average $0.92 in 2021, $1.12 in 2022 and $1.82 by 2025. Its longer-term forecast puts the price at an average of $2.84 by 2028.  Basically, no one can say what the price of Dogecoin or any cryptocurrency might be considering the level of volatility experienced in the crypto market. One thing I know for sure is that, a price surge is quite feasible for the price of Dogecoin.

For example, if the total number of coins is limited, miners would stop securing the network once the block rewards decline.  When Block rewards decrease, transaction fees would increase. It's what's happening in the Bitcoin blockchain. To solve this issue, Dogecoin creators made this crypto inflationary. But it created another problem.  Because of this inflationary model, Doge is not a store of value. In fact, it's the worst crypto as a store of value. Almost everyone in the crypto community, including institutional investors, is buying Bitcoin because it's deflationary.

So, why are we not critical of Dogecoin when its inflation rate is higher than the US dollar?  If you use the US dollar or your local currency to purchase Dogecoin, your investment is destroyed on two fronts:   * Your Dogecoin is getting devalued each passing minute.  * The US dollar is also getting devalued by our government.

By virtue of having a DOGE block time of 1 minute intervals, it is as responsive as a blockchain. The coin has no limit on the number of units it can produce, which means the inflation can grow without bounds.  Dogecoin's developers envisioned it as a humorous, light-hearted coin with a broader appeal than only because it was built on a popular Internet joke and it's associated imagery. Founding member Palmer's departure from the project came unexpectedly in 2015. Rather than talking about the theory of the decentralised, distributed digital currency blockchain, he said he concentrated on the practical and technical aspects of the underlying technology. In the last few days of December 2015, one Dogecoin was worth four thousandths of a penny.  Consensus and Tokenomics  Taking development cues from Tenebrix and Litecoin, Dogecoin currently employs a simplified variant of scrypt [ https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin ]. with a target time interval of one minute after every block, with no difficulty adjustment. When blocks have been mined, the number of coins received per block halves. In the beginning, 10,000 Dogecoin will be rewarded to the 600,000th block. Block rewards were envisioned with the Mersenne Twister pseudo-random number as an integral factor and the outcome of the block schedule multiplier as a Mersenne Twister pseudorandom number. Difficulty readjustment mechanism was altered from every four hours to one block to every minute, in order to better handle abrupt rises and falls in network hash rate. The infrastructure of Dogecoin has not been a major cause of concern for the coin's developers, many who are volunteers.  However, its active mining community is one of the reasons it continues to operate and trade. DOGE is merged mined with Litecoin. Essentially, practically everyone who mines Litecoin (LTC) chooses to mine Dogecoin as well, because merge mining Dogecoin increases profits. Dogecoin hash rate is roughly 150 TH/s. This is just below the Litecoin (LTC) hash rate of 170 TH/s.  Price action  Until 2017, however, Dogecoin did not go through the $0.0024 price until later that year. Due to this, consumers acquired more coins, and the value of the altcoin gained ground. At the time, the price varied considerably and peaked at $0.003 USD in the spring of 2017. I was rather surprised when DOGE reached 0.007 at the end of 2017. On an optimistic note, DOGE did not move more than 0.007 throughout the first year of the year of 2021 Until the beginning of April, it maintained a consistent pattern. Although the price rose rapidly for a few days, it then went on a roller-coaster ride with 100% increase on each of the next two to three. The previous historical price record for Dogecoin was broken and it moved progressively higher, climbing to an All-Time-High of $0.69 and staying there for several days. DOGE may rise to $1 by the end of next year It can be expected that in a 5-year time frame, DOGE will be worth around $15. In the worst-case scenario, it may hit $25 per share.  DOGE in popular culture  Elon Musk has recently been vocal about DOGE. SpaceX will probably launch the DOGE-1 Mission to the Moon in the first quarter of next year. \\\"Ideally, Doge speeds up block time 10X, increases block size 10X & drops fee 100X. Then it wins hands down,\\\" Elon Musk (a.k.a. the Dogefather) said in the tweet [ https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1393738154889338884 ] to light up the crypto world. By observing the community's reaction, many users believed Musk was trolling. This user claimed that Dogecoin's blockchain could be compromised if it produced 10MB blocks every second.  Adam Back, CEO of Bitcoin development firm Blockstream, questioned Musk's blockchain expertise in general. That's not how any of this works, Elon Musk. Would be like someone wading into SpaceX with ideas for a cuboid rocket fueled by water, Back wrote, adding, He's just trolling. And probably hitting a blunt.  Some researchers suggest that the DOGE itself is a Ponzi scheme, with over 65% of the total DOGE circulating in the top 98% of wallets. Dogecoin's money supply. Until very recently, dogecoin has mostly served as a reward system on the Internet websites Reddit and Twitter for the creation or distribution of great content. You can earn DOGE by joining a Dogecoin community, or you can obtain it from a Dogecoin faucet. A A dogecoin faucet is a website that will offer you dogecoin for free to help you get started with the currency.

The short answer: yes and no.  The long answer: it's a good question to ask as it has been surging in popularity, and frankly pumping behind the strength of social appeal, particularly with the backing of a pretty famous entrepreneur.  When wondering if something is a scam, I like to take a look at three things:  1. Its fundamentals 2. The people pushing it 3. Its growth, as well as how realistic (or ridiculous) it has been/can be Dogecoin Fundies  Dogecoin was created as a joke, basically satire on crypto speculation. But the important fundamental feature to emphasize here is that Dogecoin has an infinite supply cap as part of its blueprint, which means it's inflationary and at risk of losing value and purchasing power over time.  The Elon (and Social) Effect  At this point, I think it's safe to call Elon Musk an advocate for Dogecoin. He's bordering on evangelist, really.  But it's difficult to truly know whether Elon's advocacy for Doge is genuine belief or if he wants in on the joke. I believe it's equally possible that Elon wanted to participate in one of the crazier trends to emerge in the first half of 2021: a social media organization having massive impact on real-world financial conditions.  If Dogecoin is for the people, it would be because holders/believers/investors figured out how to organize on social platforms to blitz a brand name, drive up interest, and drive up the value of their asset. Organized social media influence has existed in other spaces\\u2014mainly, pop culture and social justice\\u2014but it has bled into finance in a big way this year.  Yes, that's pumping, and no, that's not particularly unique to Dogecoin or GME or any other late-millennial/Gen-Z bet. It's just never really been organized at this scale, on these platforms (that can sometimes be more about chaos than organization), so publicly, and behind longshot financial assets.  Remember the second thing I like to look at when I try to figure out if something is a scam: take a look at the people pushing that thing. What are their interests? Why are they so personally high on this thing?  In Dogecoin's case, it could literally be anything from investors trying to fuel their rocketship to a troll, a meme, or like the creators once envisioned, a joke. Search Dogecoin on twitter and you'll see post after post advocating the coin with screenshots of Robinhood accounts. The other half of posts on the trend are memes.  Speaking of the creators, here's Dogecoin co-creator Jackson Palmer offering his perspective on Elon Musk's involvement with his creation (this tweet has since been deleted):  https://twitter.com/CryptoCobain/status/1392999500269170689 Does the Math Make Sense? Does It Matter?  Here's the last part of my informal scam test: let's do a little bit of napkin math here. Looking at Dogecoin's market cap\\u2014the market value of a company's outstanding shares (for cryptocurrencies this would be their total supply), at its peak price just a few weeks ago, Dogecoin had a market cap of US $92 billion. For context, bitcoin recently flirted with US $1 trillion.  Sometimes, Dogecoin hype throws out numbers like 100 USD a coin. Hypothetically speaking, for Dogecoin to reach even 10-25 USD per coin, it would need to perform the staggering feat of absorbing all of the market cap in the crypto market.  If that seems possible, it's because sentiment can and is a driving force behind asset value. And though the math behind Doge doesn't align with its hype, the hype is gargantuan. It comes in waves, there are lulls, but the peaks are huge.  I'm wary of dismissing anything, and calling something a scam is a pretty big dismissal. But Doge's fundamentals\\u2014most importantly, it isn't deflationary, the standard set by Bitcoin when considering a new, decentralized currency\\u2014doesn't necessarily align with its sentiment.  Yet what Doge has achieved from a branding perspective in the last six months can't and shouldn't be ignored. Dogecoin is an asset of a new kind of crowd-sourced finance, and is, in my opinion, a more legitimate test of the financial impact of virality and the meme economy than a proper crypto, at least relative to the big boy Bitcoin.  If there's anything to take away from the rise of Dogecoin, it would be to better understand whether the terms that created its boom are a legitimate financial strategy moving forward."}, {"upvote": 20, "content": "No, I don't think so.

The only reason to hold DOGE is the hope that someone will want to buy them for a higher price. Demand can't go on increasing forever for a coin that isn't a good store of value or any use as a means of exchange (or anything else for that matter). With 5 billion new coins a year lots of new investors will be required just to keep the coin price from going down. DOGE investors will likely all wake up to these facts at the same time and their will be a rush to the exits. You don't want to be one of the people left holding bags if/when that happens.  Its also worth bearing in mind that something like 28% of all DOGE in existence are stored in just one wallet. The owner of that wallet could start selling and crash the coin overnight.

The scarcity of it and the fact that it is unaffected by inflation is what makes it actually worth something.  Thats how cryptocurrency works, but not how Dogecoin works.  There is no limit on the amount of Dogecoins that can be made, so inflation is rampant. It isn't a reliable source of wealth, so it has became a big **** you to traditional economics.

The supply is capped at 5 billion annually which helps the coin have a more stable price and actually it means that the supply is not totally infinite.  Inflation of about 4% means; the value needs to be increased a lot to reduce this figure.  Dogecoin is prone to long term holders dumping the coin at times of interest (such as very recently) and at different points in history.  As a currency it's actually FAIRLY good, but in terms if market cap, it's difficult to imagine Dogecoin reaching $1 since this would put it at a market cap greater than Bitcoins.

Before I talk about Dogecoin specifically, note that all low-risk, high-reward cryptos have\\u2026  1. Utility - Is the crypto solving a real world problem? How practical is it? 2. Robust Underlying Technology - How well does the technology fit the problem that the crypto is solving? Fancy technology doesn't equate to good. 3. Growing Developer Community - Does the crypto have a community of active developers working on the ledger? Is it growing? Developers of crypto ledgers are the people running the show. 4. Tight Total & Circulating Supply - The tighter the better because limited supply = increasing value (assuming demand doesn't decrease). 5. Polarizing Sentiment - Fundamental analysis aside, there exist useless cryptos that continue to surge in value. Usually the best performing cryptos will have a lot of haters, a lot of die-hard fans, and very few people in between. This is what gets these cryptos popular and in front of headlines. And so, sentiment can trump all of the points above. While Dogecoin has utility, its developer community has more or less been stagnant as of 4/20/21 (the last major development was in 2019).  To make matters worse, did you know that the supply of Dogecoins is unlimited?  I like to joke that holding Dogecoins is kind of like holding U.S. dollars because the two currency's supply just keeps on increasing.  In fact, ~14M Dogecoins get mined/created each day, which means there's really not much incentive to hold Dogecoins. As more Dogecoins get mined, the currency itself will keep on getting diluted, which manes it will constantly need more capital flowing into it for the price to rise.  While increasing demand for Dogecoin is possible, it's a huge speculative bet, even though wonderboy Elon is an advocate of Dogecoin\\u2026  Plus, unlike a stock in a company, it's hard to tell what price is a fair value for each Dogecoin, which is why I'm personally not investing in it.  While there might be a lot of upside for Dogecoin, if you manage your downside, the upside will take care of itself.  There is simply no fundamental reason for why Dogecoin should continue to increase in value (aside from Elon's pumping). The risk is just too high.

What is Dogecoin?  Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency which was launched in 2013.  Originally invented as a joke by software engineers Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus, the Dogecoin has the image of a Shuba Inu dog as its logo.  It has been marketed as the \\\"fun\\\" version of bitcoin.  Two weeks after its launch, the value of it jumped 300% after China banned banks from investing in cryptocurrencies, according to Investopedia.  Dogecoin then skyrocketed alongside other cryptos during the bubble that peaked in 2017, and it fell with the rest of them over 2018.Investing in cryptocurrencies can be an intriguing prospect for a portion of your portfolio, but you should make sure to diversify your investments with other holdings. Aside buying and holding cryptocurrency for potential gains which is a huge advantage of the benefits derived from cryptocurrency,as a cryptocurrency trade deciding on which crypto coin to choose from can be really difficult, I also recommend that you invest in service companies such as the Zippercoin(www.zippercoin.tech)company, a cryptocurrency investment company that gives return on investments made in days by capitalizing on the volatility of the crypto market to generate profits giving you better chance in the cryptocurrency market.  At its height, Dogecoin was trading for $0.018 per coin, according to crypto data firm CoinMarketCap.  Why is the value of it going up now?  At its height on Friday (January 29), Dogecoin was trading for $0.075 (5.5p) per coin, according to crypto data firm CoinMarketCap.  It jumped by a staggering 972% from $0.007 (less than 1p) the day before.  Later on Friday it started falling which continued into the weekend and then on Sunday it started going up again.  At the time of writing today (Monday February 1), Dogecoin is trading at $0.039 (2.8p), up by 41% over the last 24 hours but still below Friday's high.  The turbulence comes off the back of a bunch of Reddit threads calling for it to hit a value of $1 per coin.  Shares rocketed after an army of amateur traders targeted the games retailer, causing professional hedge funds who'd shorted it to lose billions.  But for the amateur traders, the surge saw them make some serious cash.  In simple terms, \\\"short selling\\\" is when professional investors borrow shares of stock to sell, and then buy them back at a lower price.  Essentially, they are betting that the stocks will drop in value so they can pocket the profit when they hand them back to the company they borrowed them from.  They rely on the company failing, which makes it a risky way of raising cash.  To prove a point, the Reddit community called WallStreetBets decided to take on the hedge fund by buying up GameStop stock as quickly as possible, driving up share prices.  But the hedge fund still needed to return the borrowed stock so it ended up buying back the shares at a hugely inflated price, costing them billions.  This made the price soar even more. The GameStop losses caused the hedge fund to go bust."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "This week was a wild one involving subreddits for eg Wallstreetbets vs hedge funds on wall street.

What made the increase in prices go up even further is Elon Musk tweeting suggestions which was interpreted by his supporters as a buy signal.

CC do NOT have any store of value except what people that are holding it believe it to have and are willing to trade other assets for it. Remember, you have to trade one form of asset (fiat currency, precious metal, electricity, commodities, time, effort, experience, etc.) to get a position in a CC. You can buy, trade, mine, win, find, accept or steal (I don't recommend or support this last one) any CC and add it to your wallet. However, what do you really have? Some 1 and 0's on a USB stick, paper, software entity, computer hard drive or cell phone.  I am NOT denigrating CC in any way.

As for Dogecoin, you have to understand that unlike other CC, Dogecoin has an UNLIMITED supply of coins which is probably why it is finding itself hard to get any traction. What would be the value of gold if there was an unlimited supply of Au? We live in a world, at least until cold fusion or quantum computing comes around, where economics is driven and will continue to be driven by simply supply and demand.  Why is sand so cheap in most parts of the world? Supply and demand Why is air (for the moment) free? Supply and demand Why is gold at $1850/oz? Supply and demand Why is BTC at $34K/coin? Supply and demand  However, what is the difference between these four commodities? 3 are physical and 1 is digital. Therefore, Dogecoin or ANY CC will only be of value as long as those that are dealing in it believe it to be of value since there is no physical underlying store of value (IMO) for any CC. If Mr. Musk or the Winklevoss twins were to add the hashtag #IhateBitcoin to their tweets tomorrow, any guesses on what BTC would be trading at by Monday AM?

First, it's important to understand that doge was a cryprocurrency created as a joke.  It's essentially a meme.  I've loved it for that reason for many years now. But, the problem now is that due to media hype, hardcore doge evangelists, other influencers, and the people on Reddit have been making statements that make it seem the the next big thing in crypto. What's worse is when big names like Elon Musk, who can move traditional markets with a tweet, have started making these claims too.  Now, let's be clear. It's obviously possible to make money with doge if you put in enough. However, up until about a two weeks ago. Most people trading doge know why it was created and understand how it fits withing the cryprocurrency ecosystem. Unfortunately, the recent interest in doge seems to mostly be from people who have no idea what it is. Many seem to think they are investing in something that could be the next BTC or ETH, yet don't realize that doge will never become like those cryprocurrencies because of the reasons that make the other worth what they are. People are seeing others make money off this pump and dump, and are trying to get in at prices I would have never imagined for doge. I'm worried that many people could get burned.  However, on the flip side, I will say that the massively increased exposure of doge in the media, the potential to make money, and the ability to buy/sell it easily on Robinhood may lead to a greater interest in cryprocurrencies in general. Thus, promoting the industry as a whole.  In sum, I just wish people knew what doge actually was before putting so much money into it. At least people understood (to a degree) what was going on with GameStop and what it is. When the asset being pumped is a mystery to many buying in, I worry.

In December when I first bought Dogecoin I thought well this is cool, not a lot of people own actual Dogecoin and I'm okay with seeing the dollar value go down over time. Then it 10xed.

So, bought back in at a significantly higher price, so about the same level I was with my initial buy.  10xed.  Now I'm FOMOing pretty hard and we'll see where it goes. I have kept buying during the recent (May 2021) dip.  Ok so here's pros and cons as I see it:  Pros:  Decentralized, valid cryptocurrency that is secure. I can send my Dogecoin to anyone anywhere in the world if they have an internet connection, just like Bitcoin.  Fast. Extremely fast. I timed it yesterday and it takes about 2 minutes for a confirmed transaction of any size.  Cheap. Extremely cheap to transact with. This above cost 0.60 to make this transaction. If it were Ethereum, at 60 cents? Forget about it you might as well not. $5 will take 5 hours with Ethereum. Bitcoin is pretty dang slow too, it would take about an hour to send a transaction for that kind of price.  Awesome vibes. I can't tell you the good vibes surrounding Dogecoin. Dogecoin is a marketing success, accidental or not. That magic pupper has some serious charisma.  Cons:  Supply. We want it to be like Bitcoin and have a limited supply, but that just isn't possible for the speed and thrift you need to meet the Pros above. As such, it is an inflationary currency which will fall slowly over time like the US Dollar. This encourages spending.  Mining. Why can't we mine Dogecoin? It seems like those who are mining it (or digging it) are making an incredible profit from it. What's the deal with that, I don't know.  Elon. Not resistant to manipulation. Before all the celebrity involvement, Dogecoin was incredibly flat as a cryptocurrency. That's actually good. And useful. Because if you have a reliably flat price, there's more incentive to use it as a hedge or short against other more volatile cryptos. Bitcoin goes parabolic, don't sell it for USD, exchange it for Dogecoin to lock in gains. Looks like we can't do that now since the price of Dogecoin has become way more volatile.

I wouldn't be surprised if you already know a lot about Dogecoin, but if you don't, here is some basic information: It's the most popular cryptocurrency based on the \\\"Doge\\\" internet meme. Just like Bitcoin, Dogecoin (DOGE) is a peer-to-peer payment system that allows people to send money online easily and quickly without involving any middleman.  The currency was created in 2013 as a \\\"joke currency\\\" and it's still being used just for fun. But as of August 2017, there is more than $500 million worth of DOGE in circulation. That makes DOGE the sixth most valuable cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash.  In this article I want to answer two important questions: Why do people choose Dogecoin over Bitcoin? And how can you make money from it?  It's no wonder that Dogecoin has a huge number of supporters all over the world. Despite being created as a joke, it has turned into a real cryptocurrency that could be used for payments and other operations. The point is that Dogecoin is one of the most successful altcoins out there.  Tipping is not just about giving someone free money for nothing. It is actually a way to support someone for his or her achievements. The more people are tipping, the more professionals we can attract in this industry, and the better this ecosystem will become.  This brings us to the main question of our article: should you invest in Dogecoin? It's up to you.

On February 20th, 2019, Dogecoin's price was $0.006677 per coin with a market cap of $185,717,829 USD.

Should Dogecoin investors worry about a bear market? In stock market terms, a bear market is defined as a 20% drop from recent highs. Bear markets are relatively common and can happen for a number of reasons. For example, DOGE a good buy now housing market crash caused a bear market in 2008 and 2009, while COVID-19 panic caused a short-lived bear market in 2020. Historically, DOGE a good buy now stock market has always recovered from a bear market. But don't count on Dogecoin necessarily recovering from its recent decline from its highs. A stock represents ownership in an actual company that generates revenue. Though some will lose money or even fail, most major corporations can survive even a prolonged downturn. The only value Dogecoin has is what its holders believe it has. Its wild price run-ups have been driven almost entirely by social media, particularly Tesla CEO Elon Musk's tweets. As of mid-2021, Dogecoin has extremely little utility. Very few merchants accept it. One reason Bitcoin appeals to investors is that DOGE a good buy now supply is limited to 21 million coins, whereas there's no limit to how much Dogecoin can be mined. A Dogecoin bear market could happen for DOGE a good buy now same reasons as a stock market crash, i.e., investors panic over a threat to DOGE a good buy now economy, like DOGE a good buy now coronavirus. But since Dogecoin's value is based on hype, practically anything could cause it to crash. Last week, DOGE a good buy now price of Dogecoin plummeted by more than a third after Musk called it a \\\"hustle\\\" while hosting SNL, then rose again after Musk tweeted about improving its transaction efficiency. How to buy Dogecoin safely in a bear market There's nothing wrong with betting a few bucks on your Fantasy Football league or at a slot machine. The same applies to risking a small of cash on Dogecoin. But it's essential that you stick to DOGE a good buy now following rules if you're determined to invest. Only invest what you can afford to lose The biggest rule of Dogecoin is that you should only buy it if you'd be OK with losing 100% of your investment. You may think you'll be able to cash out when DOGE a good buy now bubble starts to burst. But that's what everyone else plans to do, too. When panic sets in, it's very likely that you'll have to unload your coins for way less than you paid. Keep it separate from your investing budget A good rule of thumb is to invest about 15% to 20% of your pre-tax income. But don't consider buying Dogecoin if you'd be using part of your investing budget -- or if you'd be cashing out of other investments to do so. That 15% to 20% is meant to build enough retirement savings to sustain you for at least a couple decades in your later years -- and Dogecoin is still way too fickle to count as a reliable investment. If you're going to buy Dogecoin, it should come out of your budget for discretionary expenses, like dining out, vacations, and entertainment. Don't take on debt for Dogecoin Remember how DOGE a good buy now first rule of Dogecoin is to only invest what you can afford to lose? Well, if you take on debt to buy more Dogecoin, you may lose your principal investment and then some. Some platforms allow you to use margin to invest in Dogecoin. Here's how it works: If you wanted to invest $5,000, you could put down $2,500 cash and then use another $2,500 of borrowed money from your broker. If your coins double in value, you'd essentially triple your returns. The value of your investment would pop to $10,000. You'd pay back $2,500 to your broker, and then you'd have earned $5,000 on a $2,500 investment. But margin is dangerous, especially for volatile investments, because it amplifies your losses. In DOGE a good buy now example above, it would only take a 50% loss to wipe out your entire investment. If DOGE a good buy now value of your $5,000 investment tanked to $2,500, you'd lose $1,250 of your own money, but you'd still have to pay DOGE a good buy now full $2,500 you borrowed on margin from your broker. Investing through credit card cash advances or personal loans will also exacerbate losses because of DOGE a good buy now interest you'll pay. The jaw-dropping returns Dogecoin has generated this year can understandably lead to some fear of missing out. But don't let that cloud your judgement. Recognize Dogecoin for what it is, which is entertainment. It's not part of a solid investment plan. This article represents DOGE a good buy now opinion of DOGE a good buy now writer, who may disagree with DOGE a good buy now official recommendation position of a Motley Fool premium advisory service. We're motley! Questioning an investing thesis -- even one of our own -- helps us all think critically about investing and make decisions that help us become smarter, happier, and richer. ogecoin that started out as a fun or experimental coin has gained a lot of ground in DOGE a good buy now last few months. Initially, it was made as a joke by Billy Markus and Jack Palmer and never really expected it to take off DOGE a good buy now way it has. The currency has gained attention, ever since Elon Musk has been tweeting about it. Many personalities have also shared their views on DOGE a good buy now trend and dogecoin is hence making a lot of headlines. Now, DOGE a good buy now question comes how right it is for individuals to invest in this new buzz? To understand this, one needs to first take certain points into consideration, including- legitimacy, history of DOGE a good buy now project, market valuation, etc. According to Kumar Gaurav, founder and CEO- Cashaa, dogecoin has been in DOGE a good buy now market for over 7 years now, hence, in terms of its legitimacy, there aren't any questions. \\\"Secondly, it is said to have a defined purpose of creating a payment system that is free from traditional banking fees. So, if an investor puts money in DOGE a good buy now coin, he or she is basically participating in a constructive project, which forms for a good investment,\\\" he states. However, Gaurav adds that this is only his personal opinion and shouldn't be taken as any financial advice. The real reason for DOGE a good buy now growth of Dogecoin, as per Gaurav, is its low value, which is also helpful to teach new investors about crypto and basic principles of demand and supply in DOGE a good buy now market. \\\"The industry is in its initial stages and DOGE a good buy now value of DOGE a good buy now coin will grow given DOGE a good buy now fact that a huge number of people are joining DOGE a good buy now market every day and they pick something at a low price, to begin with. Dogecoin is at a low price right now and also considerably popular. Hence, it is a good bet, but as an investor, one needs to know when to exit from it, he affirms. Ashish Singhal, CEO and co-founder, CoinSwitch Kuber calls this totally a subjective decision. \\\"Investments in dogecoin is like any other form of cryptocurrency and should be only be done up to an amount that one is fine with losing,\\\" he suggests. Comparing it to bitcoin, Sathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin tells that while DOGE a good buy now main reason for DOGE a good buy now invention of bitcoin is fast and free payments on DOGE a good buy now internet, DOGE a good buy now increase in DOGE a good buy now price of bitcoin and very high transaction fees that needs to be paid to get DOGE a good buy now transaction in DOGE a good buy now blockchain is one of DOGE a good buy now main reason for many to think that dogecoin is a better alternative. With its transaction confirmation times being less than few minutes, and every coin to be worth no more than a few rupees, Vishwanath believes it is positing itself to be DOGE a good buy now fast free transfer use-case saviour while bitcoin is establishing itself as a digital gold which is meant to be like a reserve currency on DOGE a good buy now internet. The investment into this, he however warns, has appeared to be risker than investment into bitcoin based on its previous trends but DOGE a good buy now acceptance of DOGE a good buy now use case by DOGE a good buy now general public has DOGE a good buy now potential to make this coin as well a good investment.

Had you seen DOGE a good buy now revolution coming at DOGE a good buy now very beginning of DOGE a good buy now year and invested $1,000, you would now have over $130,000. In DOGE a good buy now past month alone, DOGE a good buy now cryptocurrency has risen from slightly less than $0.06 per token to a recent high near $0.70. That's a gain of more than 1,000%. Is there something to this surge? Is Dogecoin a good investment yet? What is Dogecoin? Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that really was started as a joke by two software engineers at DOGE a good buy now end of 2013. It's often referred to as a meme cryptocurrency because it was actually inspired by a meme that was popular in 2010 of a Shiba Inu, a breed of Japanese hunting dog. From a more technical perspective, Dogecoin is an \\\"open source peer-to-peer digital currency,\\\" according to its website. Like most digital currencies, this means Dogecoin tokens can be sent instantaneously to anyone on DOGE a good buy now internet without a bank having to facilitate DOGE a good buy now transaction, because it's part of a decentralized network. People can also use Dogecoin to send cash gifts. The reason why Dogecoin is often referred to as a joke even now is that there is nothing special or unique that sets it apart from Bitcoin, DOGE a good buy now first cryptocurrency, which pioneered blockchain as a technology and movement. Also, while DOGE a good buy now number of Bitcoin tokens will be capped at 21 million, Dogecoin has 129.5 billion tokens in circulation and counting, so there's no real supply-and-demand dynamic to its price. Other tokens do offer differentiation from Bitcoin. For instance, Etherum has its own programming language, which allows coders to build applications with it that can run around DOGE a good buy now clock and without a third party. Ethereum is DOGE a good buy now technology being used to power most non-fungible tokens such as digital trading card moments and digital art. So Dogecoin is not rising in price because of any technical differentiators behind it or DOGE a good buy now potential for uses that are unique from other cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin largely has DOGE a good buy now internet to thank for its meteoric rise. Is Dogecoin a good investment? In recent months, Tesla founder Elon Musk has been making jokes about DOGE a good buy now currency to his large social media following. In one post, Musk called himself DOGE a good buy now \\\"Dogefather.\\\"One analyst thinks that Musk's upcoming debut on Saturday Night Live has also excited Dogecoin followers, with DOGE a good buy now thought that it could spark another run. Billionaire investor Mark Cuban also appears to enjoy Dogecoin, saying it's \\\"just fun\\\" and adding that DOGE a good buy now \\\"joke is now legit.\\\" The NBA team that Cuban owns, DOGE a good buy now Dallas Mavericks, also accepts Dogecoin for payment at its merchandise store. In fact, more than 1,300 merchants now accept Dogecoin for paymentThis kind of promotion from celebrities with large social media followings has given DOGE a good buy now cryptocurrency lots of publicity across social media as well as coverage by all of DOGE a good buy now big financial media outlets. Additionally, more and more exchanges are now selling Dogecoin. Now, with all of that said, could Dogecoin ever be a legitimate investment? I don't know if it will ever warrant this kind of a run, or DOGE a good buy now $70 billion total market value it had when it recently neared $0.70 per token. But I wouldn't say it's impossible, either. Since Dogecoin's popularity took off, DOGE a good buy now asset's lead maintainer, Ross Nicoll, has said he will make changes to DOGE a good buy now technology to improve it, Coindesk recently reported. Mike Bucella, a general partner at BlockTower Capital, recently told CNBC said that DOGE a good buy now path toward legitimacy is not impossible. \\\"If there becomes enough of a community around an asset, and that community decides to effectively create long-term value through some form of declining supply cap over time, that could actually equate to a valuable currency,\\\" he said. Final takeaway I actually invested in a little bit of Dogecoin before this big run, but it truthfully had nothing to do with investment quality. In fact, I knew very little about DOGE a good buy now token at DOGE a good buy now time. I simply thought it would be something fun to watch during DOGE a good buy now work day and get a laugh out of. There have been a lot of instances this year where stocks have exploded with very little behind them in DOGE a good buy now way of fundamentals -- GameStop and AMC certainly come to mind. Given what we know about Dogecoin's technology and supply, I really don't see it as a good investment right now, and I am not sure it will ever really be able to offer any unique characteristics as a cryptocurrency. Could it eventually acquire enough of a following to make it more valuable? Perhaps. But more than likely this is a huge bubble building, so you will want to be extra careful if you are considering investing -- or, really, be prepared to lose everything you put in.Dogecoin (DOGE) is a popular cryptocurrency regarded as a meme currency by most investors. The coin has pumped several times in DOGE a good buy now past, and many crypto investors trade Dogecoin against Bitcoin in hopes to accumulate more Bitcoin over DOGE a good buy now long term.

Although Dogecoin doesn't have a clear competitive or technical advantage over other cryptocurrencies on DOGE a good buy now market, DOGE a good buy now coin currently holds a market capitalization of over $70 billion dollars. This is in part due to Elon Musk's vocal support for Dogecoin, noting on his Twitter account that The most entertaining outcome is DOGE a good buy now most likely.

Musk has tweeted about Dogecoin several times, pumping DOGE a good buy now cryptocurrency's price to new all-time highs. On March 12th, Musk encouraged Coinbase to add Dogecoin to its platform, and on April 1st Musk tweeted that he will be sending a literal Dogecoin to DOGE a good buy now literal moon.

While Dogecoin accomplishes many of DOGE a good buy now same functions of other virtual and fiat currencies, tasks like facilitating commerce, storing value and acting as a unit of account, it doesn't do anything unique to explain its meteoric rise.

To grasp this particular, one needs to to begin with take specific details to consideration, including- legitimacy, DOGE a good buy now historical past of DOGE a good buy now task, market valuation, etc. Based on CEO- Cashaa, founder, and Kumar Gaurav, dogecoin continues to be at DOGE a good buy now market for more than 7 years today, thus, of terms of its legitimacy, there aren't any sort of questions. \\\"Secondly, it is thought to have an identified aim of producing a transaction process that is free from conventional banking charges. Hence, in case an investor applies cash within DOGE a good buy now coin, he or she is simply participating inside a constructive project, what forms for a decent investment,\\\" he states. Nevertheless, Gaurav gives that this's solely DOGE a good buy now private viewpoint of his as well as should not be considered as any kind of financial advice.

Ashish Singhal, co-founder and CEO, CoinSwitch Kuber labels as this totally a very subjective decision. \\\"Investments in dogecoin is much like every other kind of cryptocurrency and must be only be done as much as an amount of money that some may be adequate with losing,\\\" he suggests. Looking at it to bitcoin, Sathvik Vishwanath, co founder and CEO of Unocoin shows that while DOGE a good buy now main reason for DOGE a good buy now innovation of bitcoin is free and fast payments on DOGE a good buy now word wide web, DOGE a good buy now increase in DOGE a good buy now cost of bitcoin as well as very tall transaction charges that should receive to purchase DOGE a good buy now transaction inside DOGE a good buy now blockchain is one of DOGE a good buy now primary reason for a lot of to believe that dogecoin is a much better solution.

Had you noticed DOGE a good buy now revolution coming at DOGE a good buy now very start of DOGE a good buy now year plus invested $1,000, you'd now have over $130,000. Previously month on your own, DOGE a good buy now cryptocurrency has risen from slightly less than $0.06 per token to a recently available high near $0.70. That's a gain of more than 1,000 %. Could there be a thing to this specific rise? Is Dogecoin a good investment just yet? What is Dogecoin? Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that truly was initiated as a ruse by two software engineers in DOGE a good buy now end of 2013. It is usually referred to as a meme cryptocurrency since it was essentially inspired by a meme that had been well-liked in 2010 of a Shiba Inu, a breed of Japanese backpacking dog. From a more technical viewpoint, Dogecoin is an \\\"open resource peer-to-peer electronic currency,\\\" based on DOGE a good buy now internet site of its. Like DOGE a good buy now majority of electronic currencies, meaning Dogecoin tokens can be delivered instantly to any individual on DOGE a good buy now net without having a savings account having to facilitate DOGE a good buy now transaction, because it is an element associated with a decentralized system. Men and women also can utilize Dogecoin to transmit cash presents. The reason just why Dogecoin is often known as a joke even now is DOGE a good buy now fact that there's absolutely nothing special or perhaps unique that sets it outside of Bitcoin, DOGE a good buy now first cryptocurrency, which pioneered blockchain as a technological innovation and also drive. Additionally, while how many Bitcoin tokens will probably be capped for 21 zillion, Dogecoin has 129.5 billion tokens in circulation and counting, consequently there is absolutely no real supply-and-demand dynamic to its price. Offer differentiation by Bitcoin is done by other tokens. For instance, Etherum has DOGE a good buy now own programming vocabulary of its, that enables coders to create apps with it that can operate on DOGE a good buy now clock as well as with no a third party. Ethereum certainly is DOGE a good buy now technological innovation being employed to operate DOGE a good buy now majority of non fungible tokens particularly electronic trading flash card occasions and/or digital art. Therefore Dogecoin isn't rising doing selling price because of just about any specialized differentiators behind it or DOGE a good buy now chance for purposes that are distinctive coming from other cryptocurrencies.

Billionaire investor Mark Cuban also seems to enjoy Dogecoin, saying it's \\\"just fun\\\" and also including DOGE a good buy now \\\"joke is now legit.\\\" The NBA group which Cuban owns, DOGE a good buy now Dallas Mavericks, additionally accepts Dogecoin for charge at its products store. In reality, more than 1,300 merchants now acknowledge Dogecoin for paymentThis promotion type from celebrities with large social networking followings has given DOGE a good buy now cryptocurrency lots of publicity across social networking along with coverage by all DOGE a good buy now major financial media outlets. Moreover, an increasing number of switches are currently retailing Dogecoin. Right now, with most of with that being said, could Dogecoin ever be described as a genuine commitment? I don't realize if it will ever warrant DOGE a good buy now type of a run, or maybe DOGE a good buy now $70 billion complete industry worth it'd in DOGE a good buy now event it recently neared $0.70 per token. But I wouldn't say it's out of DOGE a good buy now question, too.

Mike Bucella, an overall partner at BlockTower Capital, not too long ago told CNBC said DOGE a good buy now road toward validity is not impossible. \\\"If generally there will become plenty of a neighborhood around a resource, which group makes a decision to properly generate long-range quality through some kind of declining supply cap over period, that may truly equate to a very important currency,\\\" he mentioned. Final takeaway I really obtained a small bit of Dogecoin prior to this particular serious operate, but it truthfully had nothing at all to accomplish with investment quality. In fact, I knew very little about DOGE a good buy now token at DOGE a good buy now time. I simply view it would be something enjoyable to watch in DOGE a good buy now course of DOGE a good buy now workday and also obtain a laugh out of. You can find a great deal of occasions this year where stocks have skyrocketed with almost no backing them inside DOGE a good buy now technique for basics -- GameStop and AMC undoubtedly come to worry about. Provided what we realize about Dogecoin's source and technological know-how, I truly do not look at it as an excellent investment decision right now, plus I'm not certain it will ever really be able to offer any unique characteristics as a cryptocurrency. Could possibly it eventually develop an adequate amounts of a following to really make it much more valuable? Possibly. But more than likely this's an enormous bubble building, thus you will want to be more careful if you are considering investing -- or perhaps, really, be well prepared to lose anything you add in.Dogecoin (DOGE) is a common cryptocurrency regarded as a \\\"meme currency\\\" by almost all investors.

His recent tweets have helped DOGE a good buy now cryptocurrency to reach a new high. Interestingly, recently Musk tweeted, The Dogefather SNL May 8. This simply means that Musk will appear on Saturday Night Live (SNL), on May 8th. It is highly anticipated that Musk might talk about Dogecoin during DOGE a good buy now show. If he does that, DOGE a good buy now value of DOGE a good buy now cryptocurrency will new high. So, if you are planning to buy Dogecoin, it is important to pay closer attention to SNL. Furthermore, he has also revealed that Dogecoin could be DOGE a good buy now future of cryptocurrency.  Why Did Dogecoin Creator Sell All His Coins Back in 2015?  Recently Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus revealed that he sold his entire cryptocurrency holdings back in 2015. The reason behind selling DOGE a good buy now entire hold was just to purchase a Honda Civic. Further, Markus revealed that he never purchased DOGE a good buy now car and spend all DOGE a good buy now money to pay his outstanding bills.  I've always said was I sold everything for about as much as it would cost to buy a used Honda Civic. This was all my crypto too, I had Litecoin and Bitcoin and DOGE and a bunch of other ones, India Today quoted Markus as saying.  Elon Musk Ask Twitter If Tesla Should Accept Dogecoin or Not  Elon Musk asked his followers on Twitter whether Tesla should accept Dogecoin as a method of payment. Interestingly, an overwhelming of 3,922,516 people registered their opinion out of which 78.2 per cent of users said that Tesla should accept Dogecoin as a method of payment. 21.8 per cent were against this idea.  The crazy crypto world is becoming even crazier.  ICOs are on DOGE a good buy now verge of bubbling up, and insane amounts of money are flowing into almost anything and everything.  Doesn't it remind you of DOGE a good buy now pre-dot-com bubble, when every company's shares went skyrocketing in price? And we all remember how that one ended\\u2026  But even though DOGE a good buy now majority of dot-com companies crashed hard, some giants, like Amazon and eBay, were clear victors.  Winston Churchill once said:  The further you look into DOGE a good buy now past, DOGE a good buy now further you can see into DOGE a good buy now future.  It would appear that DOGE a good buy now same thing is happening now with all of these well-funded ICOs.  Most ICOs make dubious claims as to what their tech can (or will be able to) do, while many of them claim that they are what Bitcoin should have been. And most of them will fail.  Now before you go thinking that I am against ICOs or Bitcoin alternatives (altcoins), I definitely am not.  In fact, I am positive that some of DOGE a good buy now cryptocurrencies which will soon rise to power are going to be bigger than Amazon and eBay.  But putting aside ICOs for a minute, let's talk about an altcoin that has been around for a while \\u2013 Dogecoin.  So let's get started\\u2026  What is Dogecoin?  Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin which was created out of an internet meme.  Yeah, it's quite wired, at least it was to me when I first got to know about Dogecoin. It's also quite funny, like, why would someone create a cryptocurrency out of a dog meme?  Jackson Palmer introduced Dogecoin to DOGE a good buy now world in December 2013. Since then, Dogecoin has seen both bullish and bearish markets and has simultaneously earned a reputation as a tipping currency \\u2013 meaning you can tip someone instantly using Dogecoins instead of valueless upvotes, likes, and re-tweets.  Dogecoin is famously known as DOGE a good buy now joke currency.  Palmer did indeed found DOGE a good buy now cryptocurrency as a joke, but he did so under DOGE a good buy now motivation of many people who re-tweeted Jackson's idea several times.  Dogecoin's Community  Dogecoin has been around since 2013 and has a pretty well-developed community.  So let's analyze Dogecoin's BitcoinTalk, Reddit, GitHub, and Twitter communities to get a grasp on how much is left in this project.  Bitcoin Talk Forum \\u2013 Dogecoin started off with an announcement on DOGE a good buy now BitcoinTalk forum. It is no longer an official channel of communication, but you will find DOGE a good buy now community is still very active there. You can always find some Dogecoin believers/non-believers discussing this crypto's future.  Moreover, apart from bearish and bullish statements of Reddit users about Dogecoin, you will also find links such as this, this, and this which say that Dogecoin is actually being used in commerce and fundraising.  GitHub \\u2013 GitHub, which holds DOGE a good buy now source code of this open-source cryptocurrency, has not seen any update since October 2015. Also, DOGE a good buy now contribution of members of this open-source development community has not been significant."}, {"upvote": 2, "content": "Considering the fact that we are still miles away from seeing the peak of the current bull cycle, it is actually the right time to invest in any cryptocurrency with strong fundamentals.  Having said that, I think it is the right time to invest in Dogecoin.  Let me give you one solid reason.  The Dogecoin team re-established the Dogecoin Foundation on August 16, 2021. It was initially established in 2014, but fizzled out over time due to various reasons.  However, after a six-year hiatus, it is back with three objectives:   * To develop and advocate Dogecoin  * To defend Dogecoin trademark  * To provide a roadmap and governance for the future of Dogecoin What makes Dogecoin Foundation so special is two specific members who have committed to act as advisors.  One of them is Ethereum's founder - Vitalik Buterin !  The other one is Jared Birchall. I know that no one knows his name. But what if I told you that he is the legal and financial advisor to one of the world's richest persons?  Yes, our very own Elon Musk, the godfather of DOGE.  Let me show you a screenshot of the Dogecoin Foundation advisors.  These four advisors will be meeting the other five members of the foundation once a month to discuss the Dogecoin project.  Since, this foundation was re-established just 10 days back, it is natural to not see any hype as of now.  But once they make new announcements, I'm pretty positive that people will flock to grab a bag of Dogecoin.  So, if you have a chance to buy Dogecoin before the general public does, I would call that the right time to invest in Dogecoin.  ***If you like my answer, please upvote and share***"}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "It is not as good as it was a few weeks ago but nobody could have predicted that.  Dogecoin is in the middle of the adoption/acceptance process which will take time so the price can be very volatile for anyone who can't handle volatility."}, {"upvote": 80, "content": "Before investing in Doge, people should understand that Doge is an inflationary coin, meaning it has an endless supply that keeps growing more and more rapidly as time goes.

Firstly, If you are new to Cryptocurrency and you are looking for the best place to invest, I will recommend CryptoFXnetwork Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www . cryptofxnetwork . com) as it is relatively new (launched at mid-summer 2018) but has become the largest cryptocurrency Investment Platform there is right now (total volume over 4 billion dollars) where you start getting returns of your invested cryptocurrency after 10 days. Supports variety of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and other Altcoin. I find that it has a really nice UI and support.  NOTE: I recommend the consultation of a financial professional who would have a perfect knowledge of the financial and patrimonial situation of the recipient of this message and would be able to verify that the financial products mentioned are adapted to the said situation and the financial objectives pursued. This above mentioned is based on my own experience dealing with CryptoFXnetwork.  However, nobody really expected Doge to even reach $0.10 and now it's close to reaching a $1 in value. Crypto markets can be very unpredictable. One can buy Doge if you like but it would be advisable to wait till the prices drop a little. However, this is not financial advice, and people should do their own research before getting into the crypto, as the crypto markets can be highly volatile."}, {"upvote": 56, "content": "Last when we reviewed Dogecoin (DOGE) and did its price analysis and prediction then Dogecoin (DOGE) was performing well and was showing bullish trend as well but the coin has not been able to keep up its bullish movement has shown a down fall.

Hurtling round at tremendous speeds: the #98 Moonrocket, a high-performance racing car. No different from the other cars on the track, except for one crucial detail.  On the bonnet of the car: a dog. A Shiba Inu, more commonly known as a \\\"Shibe,\\\" the dog made famous in the Doge meme that was popular in 2013.  Emblazoned on top: the word \\\"DOGECOIN\\\" in all caps. Below: \\\"digital currency\\\".  Palmer describes the situation using words like \\\"crazy,\\\" \\\"surreal\\\" and \\\"nuts.\\\" He remembers this moment as a \\\"reality check.\\\" Dogecoin was a tweet, then it was a cryptocurrency worth money in the real world. Six months later, he watched as a joke that he'd made in passing somehow manifested itself into something tangible. A Dogecar in full flight.  It reminded Palmer how insane the world could be.  This is the story of Dogecoin, the joke that became too real for its own good.  The next big thing  Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency, a form of digital money that, much like bitcoin, enables peer-to-peer transactions across a decentralized network. One important difference: bitcoin is the original blockchain proof-of-concept. Bitcoin is ground-breaking. Bitcoin is (some believe) world-changing tech with the potential to transform how money works in the 21st century.  Dogecoin is a digital coin with a picture of dog on it.  \\\"It is a puzzle to me why Dogecoin is so highly valued,\\\" says Adrian Lee, a senior finance lecturer at the University of Technology in Sydney.  At one point Dogecoin was worth $2 billion. It's difficult to make sense of that.  \\\"Dogecoin is an easily replicable coin,\\\" Lee said. \\\"I don't know how it distinguishes itself from Bitcoin. I really think it has to do with being established early.  \\\"And also the dog.\\\"  If you've spent any time on the internet during the last decade, you've probably heard of the Doge meme.

Yeah, it's quite wired, at least it was to me when I first got to know about Dogecoin. It's also quite funny, like, why would someone create a cryptocurrency out of a dog meme?  Jackson Palmer introduced Dogecoin to the world in December 2013. Since then, Dogecoin has seen both bullish and bearish markets and has simultaneously earned a reputation as a tipping currency \\u2013 meaning you can tip someone instantly using Dogecoins instead of valueless upvotes, likes, and re-tweets.  Dogecoin is famously known as the joke currency.  Palmer did indeed found the cryptocurrency as a joke, but he did so under the motivation of many people who re-tweeted Jackson's idea several times.  Will Dogecoin Get as Big As Bitcoin?  I DOUBT!  I personally do not suggest investing in Dogecoin for the following reasons:   * The continued inflation is not good from an investment standpoint. There is a high chance that you will not get good returns on your investment.  * The father of the project has left the cryptocurrency world for an undetermined period of time. This is not a bad thing in itself (the father of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, has been MIA for almost all of Bitcoin's life), but Dogecoin has become directionless since his departure.  * The development community hasn't done anything (except become philanthropists) for the past 2 years.

One Doge is one Doge, now and forever. It has many of the virtues of Bitcoin. It's un-censorable, it's decentralized and not beholden to any government or company. You can make secure transactions with Dogecoin anywhere in the world.  But let's talk about block time. Every ten minutes, a new Bitcoin block is mined and a new 6.5 bitcoins are produced. 6.5 new bitcoins, 6 times per hour, 24 hours per day, there are 936 new bitcoins every day. And that's it! Clearly with demand increasing and supply staying the same, and the rate of inflation halving every 4 years, the price will continue to rise until something else happens.  Dogecoin is the opposite. It has a block time of 1 minute, and a block reward of 10,000 Dogecoins per block. 600,000 new Dogecoins every hour, 14.4 million new Dogecoins every day, and 100 billion already existing Doge.  So I think that no matter how high Doge pumps, it's not a hoarder's coin. Unless you have a plan like printing paper Doge and selling them as novelties, or just enjoying the ride along with chief pumping officer Elon Musk, it's likely that in the future the Doge will decline in value.  Mining Doge, however, may be a better prospect especially during insane pumps like this.

Dogecoin is a collectable, not an actual cryptocurrency. But Dogecoin isn't like baseball cards either. Let me explain.  #1 The Fungibility Problem  Dogecoin was built on a cryptocurrency framework as a joke. That means that each coin is interchangeable. The fancy word for that interchangeability is fungibility.  Money is fungible, family members are not.  And that's why Dogecoin, as a joke coin, really isn't a good collectable either. No coin is unique.  #2 Not One Or The Other  Since there isn't a cap on how many Dogecoins can be made either [ https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/ ], there is absolutely no reason why your holding won't be watered down through the production of more coins.  Typically, inflation is desirable in a currency for market stability. But Dogecoin isn't a good coin either. It can't handle anywhere near the minimum 15,000 transactions a second that a viable coin should be able to handle.  Concluding Thoughts  I don't really care about intrinsic value and I trade bubbles. The problem with Dogecoin to me seems that it's really only got emotional hype pumping it up. It's not unique, so it can't be a good collectable. And it's inflationary, so it doesn't have the advantages of Bitcoin's limited supply. And it doesn't have the technology to handle lots of transactions, so it won't work as a global means of exchange.  So while it's possible that Dogecoin's market cap could exceed Bitcoin's, I wouldn't count on it.

It is possible. Here's the basic math (and remember market cap = total number of coins * price per coin). Its current market cap (at $.21 a coin) is $28 billion. Now, assuming that the supply of coins remains fixed, then a $10 price tag would put the Doge total market cap at about $1.33 trillion. Bitcoin did better than that earlier this year.  So, it is possible, the question is will it?  I see two main problems with that scenario. One of them concerns the coin itself, the other is about adoption rates.  #1 The Coin Problem  The coin itself has an unconstrained market cap at present. This means that unlike Bitcoin there could be an infinite number of DOGE. (Incidentally, that's why I prefer to use CoinGecko [ https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin ], because they always list the total supply so you can calculate fully diluted market cap).  Doge is, in some ways, competing with Bitcoin. On this topic, namely supply constraint, Bitcoin is a clear winner.  When Elon said he preferred Doge to Bitcoin, his reason was that Doge has a dog on it while Bitcoin doesn't. Also, he seems to have changed his preferences (maybe?)  https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1437179881260032016 In any case, Doge will have to upgrade its coin structure to be competitive as a deflationary store of value like Bitcoin.  #2 The Adoption Problem  DOGE got to its present position because of its meme status (pumped in part by Elon). If it's going to remain in a top position, it'll need better reasons for adoption.  Enter Vitalik Buterin, the primary developer of Ethereum.  He has taken over the project of getting DOGE up to usable status with the goal of making it an environmentally friendly or Green alternative to Bitcoin. He's going to do that by switching the coin's consensus algorithm to proof of stake.  https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1433236426921971714 Notice that he additionally does not want a supply cap for DOGE, but instead would prefer that the issuance to go to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that would have a charitable purpose.  He might introduce a sort of burn rate, as has been introduced with Ethereum, to cap a wild supply growth problem and thereby keep the dilution mess under control.  Concluding Thoughts  To get to $10 DOGE needs Vitalik's help. It also needs new meme boosters. If those things happen, then $10 is possible.  From present values:   * Doge at $1 = 5x  * Doge at $10 = 50x I don't think that $1 is unreasonable in the near future (if this run continues into 2022). That's a little better possible return than what I'd expect from Bitcoin (though Bitcoin's returns are more likely).  Happy Trading!!

Some of these will no doubt go Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin distance while Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin majority fall by Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin wayside. One such asset making headlines is Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin comically named Dogecoin. What is Dogecoin? Dogecoin features Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin face of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin Japanese Shiba Inu dog which originated as a meme of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin dog with internal dialogue printed in rainbow comic sans font and broken English. The meme took off in 2010 and was voted in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin top 10 memes of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin year in 2013. That same year Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin Dogecoin (Cryptocurrency code: DOGE, symbol: \\u00d0) cryptocurrency was born. It was co-founded by IBM software engineer Billy Markus and Adobe software engineer Jackson Palmer. It's a decentralized peer-to-peer digital currency. They reportedly created it to make a payment system that was instant, fun, and free from fees. So, they took Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin original Doge meme as its logo and namesake, taking Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin mickey out of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. While it's been around for years, it's been developing notoriety in recent weeks. The GameStop mania had a part to play in this price surge but Elon Musk took it to a whole other level. The world's richest man and real-life answer to Tony Stark (Iron Man) has taken a shine to Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin strange coin. Thanks to his random tweets featuring Dogecoin, its value has exploded in 2021. The Elon Influence Why he's doing this has many speculating: is he going to resign from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), is he on a self-destruct collision course, is he invested in Doge, is he taunting Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is this his way of helping Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin underdog come out on top? It's since come to light Tesla's invested $1.5bn in bitcoin, so it turns out his interest in crypto is genuine, even if with Dogecoin he's simply having fun. There's no doubt he's a strange character and it's unlikely any of us will fathom how his genius mind works. But all speculation aside, Musk himself said in a Clubhouse discussion last week, Occasionally I make jokes about Dogecoin but they are really just meant to be jokes,. Joke or not, his tweets move markets. The value of Dogecoin rocketed 800% in 24 hours, spurred on by a Reddit board pushing for Dogecoin to become Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin crypto version of GameStop. And further boosted by Musk tweeting a parody Vogue magazine cover featuring a dog and Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin title \\u2018Dogue'.And it wasn't just Dogecoin he caused a price surge in. Linking to a r/wallstreetbets post, he also tweeted \\u2018Gamestonk!!' in reference to Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin GameStop (NYSE:GME) buying frenzy. He also professed his love for Signal, Etsy and Shopify, contributing to share price rises in all of them. The Signal he was referring to is Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin messaging app, which is not publicly traded, but nevertheless, so many Musk followers jumped into buying shares in a pharma company called Signal Advance (OTC:SIGL), that it led to a 5,675% surge in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin otherwise illiquid stock. Back in 2018 Musk was investigated by Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin SEC after making speculative tweets about taking Tesla private. His punishment was to resign as chair of Tesla for three years (he could remain as chief executive), pay a $20m fine and stop tweeting about Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin company. Despite this, it doesn't seem to have scared him off. What Drives People to Invest Real Money in a Joke Currency When Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin GameStop battle between short sellers and Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin Reddit army gathered momentum, it sent shockwaves through Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin markets. The hedge funds were haemorrhaging money, and what started as highly entertaining quickly took on a serious tone. Then Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin digital trading apps like Robinhood and its peers began restricting trades on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin stocks that were getting too much attention. This caused an outcry because people could sell, but not buy, so Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin prices of these equities inevitably dropped. It was a sad day for many, as fortunes were lost in minutes. Cryptocurrency is much less regulated than equities so although Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin price volatility is insane, some people actually feel safer putting their money in a joke coin than in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin public markets. Internet subcommunities in places like Reddit and Discord go a long way to pumping these crypto coins and then when celebrities jump in it adds fuel to Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin fire. Musk wasn't Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin only big player to join Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin Doge Army, rapper Snoop Dog and Kiss frontman Gene Simmons jumped in too.Other than being good for a laugh, one thing Dogecoin has going for it is its super-fast block time of one minute, whereas Bitcoin has a block time of ten minutes. This means Dogecoin transactions are timed quicker and being less popular than Bitcoin, it's also cheaper to use. However, Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin big reason it can't ever beat Bitcoin is because of its infinite supply. Bitcoin is a deflationary currency that can only ever have a maximum supply of 21 million bitcoins. But Dogecoin is an inflationary currency, which means more are being produced constantly and therefore it's not rare. So, while Musk might cheer for an entertaining universe where Doge is Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin currency, it's not likely to happen here.Which Cryptocurrencies Are Legit? So, what are Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin top cryptocurrencies? The top twelve cryptocurrencies by market cap are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Cardano, XRP, Polkadot, Binance Coin, Litecoin, Chainlink, Dogecoin, Stellar and Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin needs no introduction. It's Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin mother of them all and is expected to be financially regulated in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin real world to some extent soon. Ethereum is a close contender to Bitcoin. It utilises Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin blockchain to make accountancy and business practices more transparent. Many Fortune 500 companies are now using Ethereum to enhance their workflow. Ethereum has been making all-time highs recently, with its price exceeding $1600 this month. Tether Tether is what's known as a stable coin, it's tied to Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin United States Dollar, which should supposedly save it from Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin insane volatility commonplace in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin crypto markets. Tether is a centralized coin, it's not transparent and it's not scarce. It's appeal to investors is its stability. The Tether market cap is currently around $29bn. Its popularity was soaring but people are becoming suspicious of it's true purpose with speculation that it may be a way for large institutions to game Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin Bitcoin price. It's even under investigation by Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin New York attorney general's office to find out if it has simply been created to artificially inflate Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin value of Bitcoin. There's a lot of suspicion mounting around Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin coin, but if Tether collapses, it's likely to bring Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin value of its cryptocurrency peers down with it. Cardano, XRP, Polkadot & Stellar Ethereum's number one rival Cardano is another cryptocurrency rocketing in value. Fans say Ethereum's fees are too high and Cardano will beat it. Cardano's internal cryptocurrency is called Ada. XRP, otherwise known as Ripple, was once flying high but has recently been destroyed by regulatory tussle. Like Doge it enjoyed a momentary spike in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin GameStop frenzy but that's since died down. Meanwhile, Polkadot hopes to be Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin blockchain that can connect all other blockchains. Stellar is an open network for storing and moving money. It's designed so all Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin world's financial systems can work together on a single network. Bitcoin Cash Bitcoin Cash is a fork of Bitcoin. That means it's a spin-off of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin original coin. Otherwise known as an altcoin. In November 2018, Bitcoin Cash split into two cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV to further confuse matters. It's essentially Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin same thing as Bitcoin, but Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin point of Bitcoin Cash was to increase Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin size of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin blocks to process more transactions and improve scalability. At Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin time there were concerns Bitcoin Cash would become more valuable than Bitcoin, but it didn't happen. It's currently worth around $450, whereas one Bitcoin is worth over $39k. Litecoin Litecoin is very similar to Bitcoin, but it uses a different algorithm called Scrypt, whereas Bitcoin uses a traditional algorithm called SHA-256. This gives it Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin advantage of faster transactions. Litecoin has a limit of 84 million coins, so it's not as rare as Bitcoin and therefore can't ever be as valuable. Chainlink Blockchains are transparent and are becoming popular with real-world businesses. They can't be edited, and everyone can see them, so they provide a new level of trust. A part of this includes smart contracts that automatically execute on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin blockchain as conditions are met. For instance, in shipping, there are many steps along Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin route where paperwork has to be signed and verified through different jurisdictions. Smart contracts on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin blockchain can simplify this process and increase trust between parties. It's Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin main reason for Ehtereum's popularity. Connecting offline information to blockchain smart contracts in a universal language is limiting. Chainlink intends to solve this problem using oracles, which is software that acts as an intermediary. It's complicated but Chainlink attempts to simplify Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin process using reputation contracts and Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin transparency of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin blockchain. Aside from Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin array of cryptocurrencies that hope to go mainstream, there are literally hundreds of altcoins making their way in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin world. Some being promoted on Twitter today include Syntropy (NOIA), OriginTrail (TRAC), KardiaChain (KAI), and Klever (KLV). Syntropy hopes to transform Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin public internet into a secure environment with encryption and speed built in. OriginTrail wants to make supply chains work seamlessly. KardiaChain is using Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin blockchain to provide infrastructure solutions for enterprises and governments in Vietnam and South East Asia. Klever is a decentralized p2p digital crypto wallet available in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin app store. Avoid The Pump And Dump It's too easy to get caught up in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin excitement and energy of a community group, particularly when Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin promise of great riches appears to be in reach. But unfortunately, it's a dog eat dog world and many fall victim to Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin pump and dump before they've even processed what's happened. This is when a coin or stock is hyped online and talked up so much that you simply can't bear to miss out, but once Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin price goes high enough, those doing Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin persuading sell and it promptly falls leaving those getting in late left holding Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin bag. Back in 2017, when crypto hype was at an all-time high, it left many investors nursing massive losses. There was an onslaught of initial coin offerings (ICO's) that got people super excited and then left them high and dry when they went bust. Fundraising in ICO's exceeded $5 billion in 2017! Then there's Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin notorious story of Cryptocurrency queen Dr Ruja Ignatova. She persuaded people to invest billions in her Bitcoin rival OneCoin and then disappeared with Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin money. The story turned dark very quickly, and many ordinary people lost fortunes. While it's always going to be tempting to buy something very cheap, on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin chance it will turn into a 100-bagger, that's a sure-fire way to lose your shirt. To sensibly invest in cryptocurrency, it seems sticking with Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin more widely recognised, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, is Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin safest route to success. Before you leave! Having a look at Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin numbers in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin DeFi world which go up to billions, it's definitely something worth taking a closer look at. It's an interesting time to be alive and witness all these changes taking place right under our eyes. So let's continue Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin work towards Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin goals of crypto usability and adoption. Before you leave, however, we'd like to remind you to listen to Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin DTD video, too. It covers many more DeFi related topics such as Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin flaws in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin use of token assets, peer-to-peer protocols, token markets, minting schedules etc. A lot of interesting and useful information if you're just as excited about DeFi as we are!Just over ten years ago. If you wanted to send money to someone on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin other side of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin world, you would have sent it via a traditional bank transfer. For those of you that made such transactions, you will remember all too well how they took five business days or more to be received. And to top it off, you were hit by a transaction fee of around 5%, which could become very costly if you were sending a lot of money. When Bitcoin hit Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin scene in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin early 2010's it revolutionised everything. It was now possible to make a transaction to anyone, anywhere in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin world, within a maximum of 30-40 minutes and for a fee of around 1%. It changed everything, literally. Over Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin past decade, our thirst for speed in every aspect of our lives has increased exponentially. Yet Bitcoin and other blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have gone Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin other way and are actually getting slower and more expensive. How has this happened, and are there any solutions? In this week's article, we will go through some of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin most pressing issues facing blockchain cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, and how Dagcoin solves these\\u2026 Why are Blockchain-based Cryptocurrencies Getting Slower? It is fair to say that in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin past year, Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin interest in cryptocurrencies has gone through Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin roof. With Bitcoin rising from its lows of around $4000 at Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin beginning of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin pandemic, to just under $60,000 (at Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin time of writing). But with this increasing popularity comes a big problem for blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. They are painfully slow at processing transactions. To put this into perspective, VISA process over 1700 transactions per second, whereas Bitcoin can handle just 4.5. Ethereum doesn't fair much better at around 8. All of this means that Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin more transactions that are placed on these blockchains, Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin slower they will become. This is why Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin average time for an Ethereum transaction has risen from 15-30 seconds on its release in 2015 to more than 5 minutes today. With Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin growing popularity of Tether, DApps, smart contracts and online gaming, and other processes on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin Ethereum blockchain playing a big role in that slowdown. In Ethereum's case, this is why there is growing pressure to make fundamental changes to Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin currency to make it quicker. With it possible that Ethereum may drop Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin mining form of payment confirmation altogether for something quicker. It is this increasing slowdown that some fear may curb Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin rising price of Ethereum, although it is believed this will have less of an effect on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin price of Bitcoin. However, where Bitcoin is encountering more serious issues is in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin soaring fees attached to transactions, with Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin average transaction fee rising from around 50 US cents in April last year to more than $20 today.  The Banks are Catching Up  Another big issue for blockchain-based cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum is Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin fact that Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin banks haven't just sat back and watched over Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin past decade, they have been working hard to cut transaction times and costs for their customers.  Within Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin European Union, for example, SEPA (Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin Single Euro Payments Area) was established in 2014, with Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin aim to lower costs and Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin time to complete a transaction within Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin block from three business days to less than one. Fast-forward to today, and not only are almost all SEPA payments received within 24 hours, but many are also being received as quickly as within 30 seconds. Making Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin traditional banking system in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin EU often faster than a blockchain transaction.  We spoke earlier about how Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin average fee of a Bitcoin transaction is on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin rise (Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin same can be said for Ethereum, too) and now rests at more than $20. The opposite is true for Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin banks. In SEPA, an international transfer now costs Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin same as a domestic one (which is usually free). However, some banks may charge a small fee to make a transaction.  All of this means that Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin conventional banking system (at least in developed parts of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin world) is fast catching up or has superseded blockchain cryptocurrencies in terms of both speed and cost. Another reason why there is growing pressure to reform Ethereum to cut Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin costs and time associated with mining.  Dagcoin - A Faster and Cheaper Solution  What slows down blockchain-based cryptocurrencies Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin most and drives up fees is Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin payment confirmation process (mining). Not to mention Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin huge amounts of energy this process takes up. Recent estimates show that Bitcoin mining uses more electricity than Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin whole of Argentina \\u2013 a country with nearly 50 million people.  This is why DAG-chain based currencies such as Dagcoin payments are processed through a centralised network, which removes Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin need for confirmation and mining entirely. This means that Dagcoin payments are processed within 10-30 seconds. Making it possible to make a payment in a store with Dagcoin as quickly and easily as using a debit or credit card, something not possible with a blockchain cryptocurrency.  Tesla's relationship with cryptocurrencies is a stop start rollercoaster. In February, Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin electric powered car company announced it'd purchased US$1.5 billion (\\u00a31.1 billion) of bitcoin and planned to recognize Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin cryptocurrency within succeeding as a way of fee from its clients. The Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin asking price for Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin largest cryptocurrency surged that day right from just about US$39,000 to US$46,000, on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin way of its to an all time high of virtually US$65,000 in April - and a cardboard profit of well over US$1 billion for Tesla. Fast-forward a couple of brief weeks and also Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin situation has improved entirely. To start with arrived Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin news inside late April that Tesla had marketed ten % of its bitcoin holdings, reportedly to exhibit Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin electronic currency's liquidity. And much more notably, Musk has now announced on Twitter which Tesla has suspended purchases using bitcoin amid problems concerning Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin \\\"rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels\\\" utilized in mining Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin cryptocurrency. This has prompted a massive sell off in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin crypto markets, with bitcoin plunging from approximately US$55,000 on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin mid US1dolar1 45,000s, prior to recouping to around US$50,000 at Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin moment. Either way, it is difficult to believe that Tesla and Musk were not conscious of these troubles at Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin start of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin year. And Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin reality that Tesla however intends in order to keep bitcoin on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin stability sheet of its can make Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin announcement all Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin more complicated - both as it seems inconsistent with Musk's fears about carbon dioxide pollutants, and because Tesla's expense could be damaged by way of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin falling price of bitcoin. While it happens, Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin corporation's share selling price has long been fairly constant since Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin story broke. Would be Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin bull perform ending? A increasing tide lifts all boats however, Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin exact opposite may additionally be true. The concern for cryptocurrency investors is whether Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin downward change of cost marks Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin start of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin end for Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin present bitcoin bull operate, with seen Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin price rise roughly fivefold since October 2020. Prices in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin entire crypto market have previously tanked since Musk's announcement. Conversely, can this be just another of many historic bumps within Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin street simply because new currency on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin clog up aspires to become among Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin biggest inside Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin globe? Found in terms of its whole aggregate niche worth, bitcoin is actually only outside Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin planet's leading 10 currencies.Above all, bitcoin has 2 huge selling points: it's hardwired to just actually quantity to 21 thousand coins (with more than 18 million previously mined), and also it is not dominated by any kind of single organisation but is decentralised amongst thousands of big enthusiasts. Within a point in time when (centralised) nations are debasing Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin currencies of theirs by creating a lot more cash through quantitative easing, and keeping appeal fees so small it's difficult for investors to make money, a currency with a limited supply is likely to stay fairly beautiful. This is exactly why so many people and corporates are actually dipping their toenails inside Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin choppy crypto waters in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin latest months. Musk and Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin moon Crypto investors are able to console themselves that Tesla is not retailing Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin bitcoin holdings of its. When it comes to Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin moment at least, crypto switches aren't going to have to be processing long sell orders from Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin earth's primary car business. A different item to be aware in Musk's expression is he said that Tesla was potentially interested in accepting payments within cryptocurrencies with under one % of bitcoin's electricity impact. Musk has in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin past stated his apparent affinity for Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin original ruse coin turned top ten cryptocurrency, dogecoin, declaring himself \\\"Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin Dogefather\\\" - and generating resource to Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin currency in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin latest design of his on Saturday Night live.so - Domain Name For Sale | DAN.COM [ http://Live.So ] it is possible that Tesla may pivot to dogecoin as a treasury asset and also purposeful currency to boost its existing bitcoin holdings. In fact, earlier this particular week, Musk ran a poll on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin Twitter bank account of his, asking, \\\"Do you prefer Tesla to admit doge?\\\" The vast answer from his people was \\\"yes\\\". Regardless if Musk provides what they already want or maybe backs various other cryptocurrency like ethereum or ripple, most eyes will definitely be on him to find out what goes on following. Regarding bitcoin, analysts will probably be scouring Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin earnings statements of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin major companies to determine whether any sort of have relocated Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin cryptocurrency in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin treasuries of theirs. This particular part of financial earth is not short of drama, and there is sure to become more right nearby.

For what going for a futuristic notion around twelve years ago has rapidly are available very far. Bitcoin and Ethereum own Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin lion's share, but there are many more coins making waves in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin crypto markets. Some of these will undoubtedly go Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin distance while Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin majority autumn by Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin wayside. One such advantage making statements would be Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin comically named Dogecoin. What is Dogecoin? Dogecoin features Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin face of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin Japanese Shiba Inu dog that originated as a meme belonging to Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin dog with internal dialogue imprinted in rainbow comic sans font along with broken English. The meme procured above in 2010 and also was voted within Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin leading 10 memes of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin entire year within 2013. Which exact same year Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin Dogecoin (Cryptocurrency code: DOGE, symbol: \\u00d0) cryptocurrency came into this world. It's co founded by IBM software engineer Billy Markus in addition to Adobe software engineer Jackson Palmer. It is a decentralized peer-to-peer digital currency. They reportedly produced it to make a payment device that had been instant, fun, and free at fees. So, they had taken Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin initial \\\"Doge\\\" meme as its logo and namesake, taking Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin mickey out of cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. While it's been around for years, it's been creating notoriety inside recent lots of time. The GameStop mania had a role to relax within this particular price level surge but Elon Musk took it to a whole additional fitness level. Our planet's richest male and real-life answer to Tony Stark (Iron Man) has brought a shine on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin strange coin. Because of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin random tweets of his featuring Dogecoin, its great has exploded in 2021. The Elon Influence Why he is doing this has several speculating: is he planning to resign from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), is he on a self destruct collision course, is he invested in Doge, is he taunting Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin US Securities and also Exchange Commission (SEC), is this Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin way of his of helping Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin underdog come out on top? It has since come to mild Tesla's expended $1.5bn in bitcoin, therefore it turns out his interest in crypto is legitimate, even though with Dogecoin he's just having fun. There is no doubt he's an odd persona also it's not likely any sort of individuals will fathom just how Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin genius mind of his functions. although just speculation separate, Musk himself stated in a Clubhouse dialogue previous week, \\\"Occasionally I generate jokes regarding Dogecoin but they're really only designed to be jokes,\\\". Ruse or not, Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin tweets of his proceed areas. The value of Dogecoin rocketed 800 % in 24 hours, spurred on by a Reddit board clicking for Dogecoin for being Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin crypto version of GameStop. Not to mention even further boosted by Musk tweeting a parody Vogue magazine protection that starred a dog and Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin title' Dogue'.And it wasn't only Dogecoin he caused a price surge within. Linking out to a r/wallstreetbets content, he also tweeted' Gamestonk!!' within resource to Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin GameStop (NYSE:GME) buying frenzy. He also professed his like for Signal, Shopify along with Etsy, leading to talk about price rises in most of them.

What Drives Customers to Invest Money which is real within a ruse Currency When Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin GameStop battle between quick sellers as well as Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin Reddit army gathered momentum, it sent shockwaves through Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin markets. The hedge money have been haemorrhaging money, and what launched as highly enjoyable rapidly took over a serious tone. Then Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin electronic trading apps as Robinhood and its colleagues began reducing trades on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin stocks which were becoming far too much care. This caused an outcry due to Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin fact folks can easily sell, but not buy, so Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin rates of these equities inevitably dropped. It had become an unfortunate day for a lot of, as fortunes have been lost in minutes.

It is actually under investigation by Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin new York lawyer general's office to find out in case it has just been created to artificially inflate Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin importance of Bitcoin. There is a great deal of suspicion mounting all around Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin coin, however, if Tether collapses, it's very likely to get Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin importance of its cryptocurrency peers down with it. Cardano, XRP, Polkadot & Stellar Ethereum's quickest opponent Cardano is another cryptocurrency rocketing within value. Followers say Ethereum's fees are exorbitant & Cardano will overcome it. Cardano's inner cryptocurrency is called Ada. XRP, normally called Ripple, was once flying high but has recently been damaged by regulatory tussle.

For example, in shipping and delivery, you will find a lot of steps around Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin route wherein documents must be signed and also validated by different jurisdictions. Smart contracts on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin blockchain is able to shorten this process and also increase loyalty between get-togethers. It's Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin primary reason behind Ehtereum's popularity. Connecting real world information to blockchain smart contracts inside a universal vocabulary is restricting. Chainlink intends to fix Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin issue utilizing oracles, that is software which functions as being an intermediary. It's difficult but Chainlink attempts to shorten Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin task making use of reputation contracts and Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin transparency on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin blockchain. Besides Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin array of cryptocurrencies that will aspire to go mainstream, you'll find unquestionably a huge selection of altcoins generating their strategy within Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin world.

Stay away from The Pump And Dump It's way too uncomplicated to get swept up in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin excitement in addition to being energy of a local community team, mainly when Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin promise of great riches seems to be in grasp. But sad to say, it is a dog consume many fall and dog arena prey for Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin pump and also dump before they have even prepared what is taken place. This's when a coin or perhaps inventory is hyped on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin web and spoken up a lot you just cannot bear missing away, but as soon as Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin price becomes high enough, those carrying out Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin persuading sell and it at a faster rate declines making all those getting in late left holding Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin popcorn bag.

The story made dark very quickly, and many regular individuals dropped fortunes. While it's constantly gon na be seductive to purchase a little something really cheap, on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin possibility it will turn right into a 100 bagger, that's a sure-fire method to relinquish your shirt. To prudently spend money on cryptocurrency, it appears to be sticking with Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin greater extensively recognised, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, stands out as Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin most appropriate path to good results. When you provide! Making a look in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin quantities wearing Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin DeFi earth which will go as many as massive amounts, it is definitely something well worth having a better overall look at. It's a fascinating time to become in existence and enjoy all Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin changes occurring properly under Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin eyes of ours. Why don't we continue Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin work towards Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin targets of crypto enhancing as well as adoption. Before you leave, nevertheless, we'd like to remind you to focus on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin DTD online video, as well. It discusses many more money DeFi associated subject matter like Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin weaknesses inside Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin usage of token property, token markets, peer-to-peer protocols, minting schedules etc. A good deal of useful and interesting information if you're just as enthusiastic about DeFi as we are!Just more than 10 years ago. If you wanted to send money to somebody on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin opposite side on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin planet, you would receive it using Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin average bank transfer. For those who are that produced these transactions, you will remember too properly how they snapped 5 company days or higher to be gotten. And to be able to finish it off, you were bite by a transaction fee of approximately 5 %, that could end up very pricy in case you were driving an a considerable amount of cash. When Bitcoin arrive at Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin world in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin early 2010's it revolutionised all. It was presently achievable to make a transaction to any person, anyplace in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin planet, within an optimum of 30 40 mins as well as for a fee of about 1 %. Everything was revised by it, basically. Over Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin older ten years, our greed for pace within each and every element of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin lives of ours has risen exponentially. However Bitcoin as well as other blockchain based cryptocurrencies went another manner and also are actually prompting more slowly plus more expensive. How has this particular taken place, and are presently there any kind of remedies? With this week's report, we are going to go by way of several of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin most pressing difficulties facing blockchain cryptocurrencies including Ethereum and Bitcoin, and how Dagcoin solves these\\u2026 Why are Blockchain-based Cryptocurrencies Getting Slower? It's fair to state that inside history 12 months, Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin interest in cryptocurrencies went throughout Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin top. With Bitcoin rising through its lows of approximately $4000 with Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin beginning of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin pandemic, to just under $60,000 (at Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin time of writing). But with this particular growing popularity comes a big dilemma for blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. They're painfully nonchalant at processing transactions. To put this particular directly into standpoint, VISA process over 1700 transactions per second, whereas Bitcoin is able to handle precisely 4.5. Ethereum doesn't reasonable much better at around 8. All of this means that Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin more transactions which are positioned on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin blockchains, Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin reduced they will become. This's exactly why Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin normal time frame for an Ethereum transaction has risen from 15 30 minutes on its release in deep 2015 to a lot more than 5 minutes now. With all Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin increasing interest in Tether, DApps, sensible online and contracts gaming, along with other functions over Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin Ethereum blockchain participating in a huge job within that particular slowdown. Inside Ethereum's instance, this is why there's harvesting strain making fundamental change on to Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin currency to enable it to be faster. With it likely that Ethereum may well shed Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin mining form of payment confirmation entirely for something faster. It is this particular escalating slowdown which quite a few concern might curb Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin climbing price of Ethereum, nevertheless, it's believed this will have significantly less of an impact on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin cost of Bitcoin. Nevertheless, in which Bitcoin is encountering more dangerous concerns is in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin soaring charges linked to transactions, with Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin regular transaction expense climbing right from around fifty US cents in April previous 12 months to greater than twenty dolars today.  Tesla's rapport with cryptocurrencies is actually a stop-start rollercoaster. In February, Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin electric powered car manufacturer announced it had invested in US$1.5 billion (\\u00a31.1 billion) of bitcoin and planned to acknowledge Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin cryptocurrency in later as a means of payment right from Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin clients of its. The price of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin largest cryptocurrency surged which morning from just about US$39,000 to US$46,000, on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin way of its to an all time high of just about US$65,000 in April - and a cardboard make money of well over US$1 billion for Tesla. Fast-forward a few short weeks and Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin circumstance has changed completely. To begin with came Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin news in late April that Tesla had sold 10 % of its bitcoin holdings, reportedly to demonstrate Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin electronic currency's liquidity. And much more importantly, Musk has now announced on Twitter which Tesla has suspended buys making use of bitcoin amid concerns about Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin \\\"rapidly improving use of fossil fuels\\\" used in mining Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin cryptocurrency. This has encouraged a massive sell-off in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin crypto marketplaces, with bitcoin plunging out of around US$55,000 on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin mid-US1dolar1 45,000s, prior to retrieving to more or less US$50,000 at Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin moment. Either way, it's tough to think that Tesla and Musk weren't alert to these troubles at Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin commencement of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin year. Plus Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin fact that Tesla nevertheless intends in order to keep bitcoin on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin stability sheet of its makes Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin announcement even more confusing - each since it appears to be inconsistent with Musk's concerns regarding carbon emissions, and because Tesla's investment is usually harmed by way of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin falling expense of bitcoin. While it happens, Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin business's share price has been pretty steady since Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin story broke. Stands out as Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin bull perform ending? A increasing tide lifts all boats however, Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin opposite can additionally be true.

Costs within Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin big crypto market already have tanked since Musk's announcement. Alternatively, is this simply an additional of numerous historic lumps within Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin road simply because brand-new currency on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin block aspires to be among Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin largest in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin world? Found in regards to its overall aggregate niche value, bitcoin is actually only outside Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin planet's top 10 currencies.Above almost all, bitcoin has 2 major marketing points: it's hardwired to simply previously amount to 21 million coins (with over eighteen zillion already mined), and it's not dominated by just about any single organisation but is decentralised among countless large owners. At a point in time when (centralised) nations are debasing their currencies by producing a lot more cash through quantitative easing, and also maintaining interest rates extremely small it is tough for investors to earn money, a currency with a limited source is likely to be incredibly attractive. This's exactly why so many corporates and folks happen to be dipping their toes within Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin choppy crypto waters in recent several weeks. Musk and also Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin moon Crypto investors are able to console themselves that Tesla is not retailing Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin bitcoin holdings of its. For Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin moment at Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin very least, crypto exchanges will not have to be processing large sell orders from Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin earth's biggest car business. A other item to take note in Musk's expression is that he said Tesla was also potentially enthusiastic about taking payments within cryptocurrencies with only one % of bitcoin's energy footprint.

The Tether industry cap is now approximately $29bn. Its attraction was soaring though individuals are starting to be distrustful of it is correct goal with speculation which it might be a means for huge institutions to game Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin Bitcoin price. It is even under searching by Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin new York lawyer general's office area to figure out if it's just been developed to artificially inflate Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin importance of Bitcoin.

Before you leave! Having a peek in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin quantities using Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin DeFi earth which will go up to enormous amounts, it's definitely a thing well worth having a deeper look at. It is an intriguing time to be alive along with enjoy almost all these modifications going on right beneath Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin eyes of ours. Why don't we continue Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin work towards Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin targets of crypto usability as well as adoption. Before you leave, nonetheless, we'd love to remind you to pay attention to Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin DTD online video, as well.

In Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin event you want to send out cash to someone on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin reverse side around Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin world, you would receive it using a regular bank transfer. For those who are that generated these transactions, you will remember much too properly how they took 5 small business days or weeks or more to get gotten. And also to finish it off, you are knock by a transaction fee of around 5 %, that could end up extremely expensive if you had been driving a great deal of money. When Bitcoin arrive at Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin arena within Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin original 2010's it revolutionised everything. It has been currently achievable to create a transaction to any individual, somewhere inside Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin world, inside a maximum of 30 40 mins as well as for a payment of approximately one %. It altered every little thing, basically. Over Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin previous decade, Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin thirst of ours for speed in just about every area of our lives has risen exponentially. Yet Bitcoin along with other blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have gone another way and are in fact encouraging more slowly plus more costly. Just how has this taken place, and are presently there any kind of remedies? Through this week's post, we are going to go by means of some of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin most pressing difficulties facing blockchain cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, and just how Dagcoin resolves these\\u2026 Why are Blockchain based Cryptocurrencies Getting Slower? It's fair to state that inside Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin past 12 months, Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin fascination in cryptocurrencies has gone through Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin roof top. With Bitcoin increasing from its lows of about $4000 at Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin start of pandemic, to slightly below $60,000 (at time of writing). However with this specific growing popularity comes a huge problem for blockchain based cryptocurrencies. They're painfully nonchalant at processing transactions. To put this into viewpoint, VISA process more than 1700 transactions a second, whereas Bitcoin is able to deal with precisely 4.5. Ethereum does not reasonable more effective about 8. This implies that Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin greater number of transactions which are placed on these blockchains, Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin reduced they'll become. This's Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin reason Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin average period for an Ethereum transaction has risen from 15-30 minutes on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin generate of its deeply in 2015 to much more than five minutes right now. With all Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin increasing public attention towards Tether, DApps, smart contracts and web gaming, and other processes over Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin Ethereum blockchain participating in a huge role inside that slowdown. In Ethereum's situation, this's why there's harvesting pressure for making essential echange on to Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin currency to make it faster. With it feasible that Ethereum might lose Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin mining form of charge confirmation altogether for a specific thing faster. It's this particular growing slowdown that a few fear might control Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin rising price of Ethereum, nevertheless, it's thought this will have much less of an impact on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin cost of Bitcoin.

Either way, it's difficult to believe that Musk and Tesla weren't aware of these troubles in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin commencement of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin entire year. Plus Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin point that Tesla however intends to make bitcoin on its stability sheet can make Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin announcement all Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin more perplexing - each because it seems inconsistent with Musk's worries regarding carbon emissions, also, since Tesla's investment could be harmed by way of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin dropping price of bitcoin.

It is an intriguing time frame to become alive as well as enjoy just about all Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin modifications occurring correctly underneath Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin eyes of ours. Let's keep on doing Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin job towards Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin targets of crypto enhancing and adoption. Before you leave, nonetheless, we'd love to remind you to pay attention to Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin DTD video clip, as well.

Ethereum does not reasonable a lot better around eight. All this implies that Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin more transactions which are placed on these blockchains, Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin slower they will be. This's Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin reason Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin typical time for an Ethereum transaction has risen by using 15-30 secs on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin release of its in deep 2015 to a lot more than five minutes right now. Considering Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin increasing interest in Tether, DApps, sensible internet and contracts gaming, along with other processes over Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin Ethereum blockchain playing a big role inside that kind of slowdown. Inside Ethereum's situation, this is Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin reason there is cultivating strain for making fundamental improvements on to Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin currency to allow it to be quicker. With it possible that Ethereum might drop Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin mining form of charge confirmation completely for something faster. It is this particular increasing slowdown that a few concern may suppress Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin climbing cost of Ethereum, even thought it's considered this will have much less of an impact on Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin price tag on Bitcoin. Nevertheless, in which Bitcoin is encountering more severe difficulties is in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin soaring charges attached to transactions, with Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin typical transaction expense rising right from around 50 US cents in April previous year to more than $20 nowadays.  Without Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin need to pay miners for payment confirmations, this also makes Dagcoin a much cheaper alternative as well. In fact, it doesn't matter if you are sending 20 or 20,000 dags, Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin transaction fee will still be around 0.0005 dags. To put that into perspective, based on Dagcoin's current price of 73 euro cents, this is less than one cent per transaction.  Whereas blockchain-based currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are hardwired to continue getting slower over time. DAG-chain technology means that payments will only get faster and faster, Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin more people use them. And, with no miners, they use a fraction of Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin electricity \\u2013 helping to combat climate change too.  Conclusion  Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have a big problem, they are getting slower and more expensive over time. To put this into perspective, VISA process 1700 transaction per second. Bitcoin can handle 4.5 and Ethereum around 8 in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin same timeframe. All of this means that Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin more people use these currencies, Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin slower they will become. This is why Ethereum transactions have gone from 15-30 second when it was released in 2015 to more than 5 minutes on average today. And with it only set to get slower over time, many in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin Ethereum community are even pressuring for mining based payment confirmations to be dropped altogether.  This has been made worse by Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin banks, which have got much faster and cheaper in Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin past decade. In Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin EU's SEPA region, for instance, international payments can be received as quickly as 30 seconds and for Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin same fees as a domestic payment (often free).  Dagcoin solves both of these issues because not only do transactions take just 10-30 seconds to be processed. The bigger Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin community gets, and Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin more people make transactions, Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin faster it will get. Add Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin fact that a Dagcoin transaction costs less than 1 euro cent no matter how much you spend, and you have a cryptocurrency that is a cheaper and quicker alternative to both blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and Elon Musk interested in Dogecoin traditional banking system.

It's already been at $0.74, and today hovers around $0.40. 10x from here is $4.00, 100x from here is $40.00. So I think $100 is completely plausible.

You can add up all the oil reserves, for example, and that value is going to be more than the value of all the oil companies. But it's useless when its sitting in the ground, not all oil is for sale at the same time, so the price isn't at all as supply dependent as company stocks.

It is a fully digital currency with a Shiba Inu logo and a Japanese name, \\\"Doge.\\\" Dogecoin is known for its ease of use and low transaction costs, at around 1 DOGE each transaction. In addition, because Dogecoins are inflationary, the amount of Doges rewarded per block decreases by five every week (about 7% p.a.). As a result, more Dogs are produced as more individuals adopt Dogecoin and mine it. Doge does appear to have some potential since it's backed by a passionate community and one of the most recognized dog breeds on the planet; however, there are many hurdles such as no significant innovation nor development happening recently, as well as giant whales holding Bitcoin and other crypto are reluctant to invest in Doge currently.  Dogecoin is currently sitting in the 31st position on Coinmarketcap, and Dogecoin's market capitalization has been hovering around $643 million for some time now. Doge is not a deflationary currency, one of the major things that put off many investors from Doge.  Doge has an enormous potential to grow and reach $100 in the future since Dogecoins are generated at a breakneck pace. Dogecoin is still struggling with substantial transaction volumes through its network. Furthermore, due to its super-fast confirmation times and low transaction fees, Doge can be used as a price-stable cryptocurrency for microtransactions. I believe Doge has the potential to hit $100 if it continues to outperform other crypto coins.  Dogecoin skyrocketed from around 10 Doge per dollar to over 1 Doge per dollar in January 2014, prompting some media outlets to call Doge \\\"the next big cryptocurrency.\\\" Since its inception, Dogecoin has been used as a tipping currency. Recently, another price surge occurred, pushing the value of Dogecoin from around 100 Doge/USD to 300\\u2013500Doge/USD at the time of writing this article; many people are wondering whether or not it will reach $100.  Dogecoin's primary use is as a currency on websites that accept Dogecoin for tipping. However, Dogecoin has been used as a currency of choice by many new cryptocurrency users, and Doge continues to grow in popularity. Dogecoin is also easier to mine than Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, drawing more new blood into the Doge mining community.  Dogecoin will most certainly reach $1 and perhaps even $10 in a decade or two. However, to attain a market capitalization of $100 billion, Doge must first hit $18 trillion. Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that uses an internet meme as its mascot, Doge. Dogecoin was introduced on December 8th, 2013. It took off in January 2014 when it reached a market capitalization of $60 million in January before crashing down to a low of around 1 Doge per USD. Dogecoin was designed by Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon, and Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia. Dogecoin has become a popular tipping service on Reddit and Twitter, where users give each other Dogecoins for producing or sharing good material. Due to its quick confirmation time and comparatively lower transaction costs compared to Bitcoin, Dogecoin is the preferred method of tipping.  In September 2014, Doge experienced one of the largest bubbles observed so far among cryptocurrencies.  It would be tough for Dogecoin to hit $100 because there isn't enough money in the world. Every $1 that the Dogecoin price rises requires an extra $180 billion by 2030. To do so, you'll need $18 trillion in investments in Dogecoin by 2030. However, Dogecoin could hit $100 if Doge starts to be used globally for purchasing goods and services outside of tipping. Doge needs to be seen as a real, viable currency going places, not necessarily a joke. Unfortunately, Dogecoin has been thought of as a joke even by some members of the Doge community, which causes big investors to not invest in Doge despite its awesome utility compared to other cryptocurrencies.  It may be possible for the dogecoin price to hit 100$, but only time will tell what developments the Doge team will make from this time to reach up to 100$. Though Doge was indeed started as a meme, still Doge has some great features like low transaction fees and fast confirmation times which other cryptocurrencies still lack.  A big factor in determining if Dogecoin's $100 goal is feasible is basic supply-and-demand principles. Because DOGE mining is so difficult, it's very tough for one DOGE to attain a price of $100. That said, $1 per DOGE seems entirely plausible, and $10 per DOGE isn't entirely beyond the realm of possibility."}, {"upvote": 9, "content": "Short and sweet\\u2026  Dogecoin's expected sale prices.  $4+ April 2021  $5 - $8 December 2021  $8+ 2022  $21 2025  $42 2030  Unless adopted as a uniform world (or moon ha ha) currency, thereby requiring the higher possible cap that is discussed as unlikely in other answers, Dogecoin is expected to level out in the 40 to 50 dollar range in less than 10 years.  So to answer your real question. Yes, buying Dogecoin at any price below $10 would still a very good investment on your part. Also with an expected return of over 5000% or more (based on current prices and past performance) in just a few years then even a few dollars can go a long way."}, {"upvote": 8, "content": "It would be nearly impossible for Dogecoin to reach $100, because there isn't quite enough money in the whole world.

Global GDP is estimated to be about $87 trillion. The GDP of China is around $15 trillion, while the GDP of the U.S. is about $21 trillion.  In other words, a $100 DOGE price would require a market capitalization of more than the annual gross-domestic product of the entire nation of China by the year 2030. It doesn't take a market genius to determine that this simply isn't going to happen.  Even if that much money wanted to find a home in DOGE, it's unclear whether or not crypto exchanges would be able to handle that kind of volume.  There's one more factor to consider. The total holdings of all the DOGE that has been mined, as of 2021, are centralized into the hands of just a few crypto wallets.  One wallet holds more than 25% of all the DOGE in existence, while the top 20 wallets hold over 50% of all DOGE."}, {"upvote": 8, "content": "It has the potential to pass 100 USD whether it will or not remains to be seen.

If the price of dogecoin reached $100, then the entire supply of dogecoin (its market capitalization) would be worth $11,891,919,329,400, or nearly US$12 trillion.  Apple and Amazon's market caps have been somewhat higher than $1 trillion. I have a very hard time believing that the market cap of a coin that started as a joke [1] can become worth around 12 times what Apple or Amazon have been at their peaks.  Dogecoin is worth US$0.002847 as of my typing this (less than a penny), and the value would have to go up 35,124.69X to get to US$100.  The potential for the price of dogecoin to go up by 35,124.69X seems very, very low.  Of course, any kind of market cap is possible if you can somehow get enough money behind it.

I'll explain in two points.  #1 Riding The Bubble  My whole strategy in the cryptocurrency space is to ride the bubbles. For my (free) subscribers at The Art of The Bubble [ https://theartofthebubble.substack.com/p/how-to-trade-a-bubble-bounce-explained ], I outlined when and why I first bought into Ethereum in 2020. Including all my late buys, I'm still up more than 15x on $ETH.  There is a strategy that I pursue that is both counterintuitive and dead simple. It is this: bubbles go up the most at the end, so you make more money by holding through the top and riding it down a bit, than by getting out early.  Here's an image of the cannabis stock $CGC in its bubble.  Here's an image of the tech bubble (trading the $TQQQ).  Here's an image of Bitcoin in 2017.  In every case, riding up over the top and getting burned is the way to go. The reason is that bubbles are inherently irrational, so you just can't predict how high they'll go.  For Bitcoin, it was doing 100% every few weeks at the end (assuming you invested in May of 2017). So, it's obviously better to lose 36% from a 12x run than it is to keep 100% from a 2x run.  There's an art to this, but that is the general idea. $ETH goes up more than Bitcoin in a cryptobubble, so I bought $ETH early.  I didn't buy $DOGE for that reason. I'm treating it instead as a bounce.  #2 Playing The Bounce  I've also explained how to play a bounce in my newsletter [ https://theartofthebubble.substack.com/p/how-to-trade-a-bubble-bounce-explained ]. I look for the following:  1. The general macro-economic environment is good, 2. The general trend of the industry (cryptos generally) are still going up, 3. The specific coin is way down from a recent high. For the general trend, point 2., I've been using $BTC. If it's above the simple moving average of the last 160 days, then I tend to think the industry is good.  Here's an image with the simple moving average (SMA) of the 50-day trend line in red and the 160-day trend line in black.  So, the general trend is ok. If it drops below 160, I'll lose confidence in the longevity of this bull run.  With $DOGE, after Elon Musk's SNL skit, and then his recent Tweet about the environment, it fell quite a bit.  Since $DOGE is fairly environmentally sustainable, I bought it. In fact, I bought a basket of green coins, including $DOGE, $ADA, and $DOT.  It's up over 40% since my buy, and I'll probably sell soon. This is a bounce trade, not a long hold. I only look for 25% - 50% returns on a bounce trade. That's pretty good money for a 3-day trade.  But What If I'm Late To A Bubble?  This is one of the top 2 questions I get. I wrote a whole article about this one too [ https://theartofthebubble.substack.com/p/am-i-too-late-for-this-bubble-a-3 ]. Here's the deal: you are going to want to structure trades so that they are rationally positive.  For example, suppose that the pay rate on a bet was a possible 30% up and 30% down. That's a 1 to 1 reward to risk ratio. You'll have to get better than 50% of those right to win money consistently  Suppose you are betting $100 on each such trade. This is what you might get.  1. Win: $100 2. Win: $100 3. Lose: $100 4. Lose: $100 See, after 50% wins and losses with a 1 to 1 pay-out, you end up even.  So, you need to set up your trades so that they have either (a) better than a 50% chance of winning, or (b) better than a 1 to 1 payout.  When I set up my bounce trades, my low-end estimate gain is 25% and I will sell if I lose more than 8%. That's better than a 3 to 1 payout.  For my bubble trades, the payout is often 7 to 1. Since they are longer holds, I need to know about the macroeconomy. That increases my probability of winning beyond 50% to about 71% (on a 22-year backtest).  You might not be in a position to know about macro-economic structures. Even if you are, like me, you'll still be wrong. So, the main thing to focus on is the payout to increase your odds.  So, that is why I like both $ETH and $DOGE \\u2026 and how I trade them. There might be other reasons to buy them, and you might not be in a position that these sorts of trades make sense.  From here, $ETH might do a little over 2x and $DOGE a little over 3x. It's an off-hand guess, but I think Elon's work with $DOGE might make it something more than a meme coin. $ETH has a major update coming in July.  Happy Trading!!

Trade Dogecoin  3 Reasons To Trade in Dogecoin   * Inflationary cash  * Vibrant people group  * 1 DOGE = 1 DOGE. 1. Inflationary Currency Unlike Bitcoin, Litecoin, and numerous other cryptographic forms of money, Dogecoin is inflationary cash. It might appear to be strange to consider expansion something to be thankful for as it makes singular DOGE worth not exactly if there was a shortage. Nonetheless, it is a component that may guarantee Dogecoin's endurance. Here's the reason.  With most monetary standards, an enormous number of coins can be lost or harmed because of clients losing equipment, failing to remember wallet passwords, and so on This is particularly valid for cryptographic money like Dogecoin, where clients routinely spend their coins.  An inflationary coin can help guarantee a consistent stockpile and that mining will likewise be in any event semi-beneficial.  2. Vibrant Community Dogecoin without a doubt has perhaps the best network out there. They are congenial, inviting, and supportive. They fund-raise for a noble cause.  They're attempting to put an actual Dogecoin on the moon. They routinely send Dogecoin as tips to different clients as compensation for engaging or useful substance.

Basically, they are stating that they need to utilize the coin as value-based cash, instead of a theoretical resource.

Doing essentially what Bitcoin and Litecoin do. Hash transaction blocks in there own methods. There are very few coins that are inherently different from Bitcoin.  One of the reasons I think Doge caught on is because you can dig it straight from your computer wallet.  Making it easier to spread to the community and for some reason has gathered mass adoption in the cryptocurrency community, mainly in china. Which could be detrimental to dogecoin if they interfere.  It's honestly just giving early adopters a way to distribute the wealth of Bitcoin.  It's in very high supply right now.  Halving is set for mid feb so well see what happens.  Once you switch over to Bitcoin and start trading altcoins you stop thinking in dollars. You start thinking in terms of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin seems to be the savings side of how people retain their value since it's the most trusted.  Bitcoin is not a bad idea it's just not optimized.

Are you looking for quick profit by buying & selling or holding your investment long term or a combination of these?

If you bought a Bitcoin in 2015 at $1000 today in 20212 days ago you could have sold it for over $63K USD but today it is about $54K.

Here is the biggest pitfall in my opinion with the crypto marketplace.  If you ask 10 people for advice you probably will get different advice from each person.

In fact, I believe Dogecoin could reach one dollar per coin. Powered by meme virality, unique branding, and its eventual utility as a currency, Dogecoin is a perfect storm that is poised to soar. Let me explain.  These days, there are a lot of legitimate offers online that gives great advantage to cryptocurrency investors where they get good returns of their invested cryptocurrency on platforms like CryptoFXnetwork Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www . cryptofxnetwork . com). These are opportunities that need to be really utilized to its maximum.  On the date of publication, Steph Brooks did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.  Steph Brooks, CFA, is a registered investment advisor on a mission to bring simplicity to the world of investing.  1. Dogecoin is a Meme. That gives it power.  Memes are ideas, they are decentralized inside-jokes. Their hive mind virality spreads like wildfire in the cultural zeitgeist. Like a virus, memes mutate and adapt, blending with other memes to appropriate trends. Their parabolic growth is expedited due to the inter-connectedness of our social media world.  Like the GameStop phenomenon, Dogecoin is fueled by memes, fervor, and a decentralized community of retail investors. The GameStop short squeeze was propelled by viral memes in the WallStreetBets Reddit community. Memes like we like the stock! and diamond hands lit a fire under the movement, with jokes about tendies, stonks, and degenerate trading fueling the blaze. Doge is a meme, and as we've seen, memes take on a life of their own. They are not to be underestimated.  Words like much, wow, and many are popular in Doge memes like this one.  Most memes usually peak and die out, but some stick around. And here's the thing with Doge: it's Lindy. It's been around for an unusually long time. That gives it a higher probability of surviving even longer.  As the meme expands and its utility as a cryptocurrency is actualized, Dogecoin will grow in popularity and value. Although currently floating around four cents, it could eventually reach a dollar. Dogecoin to a dollar has become a part of the meme. #DogecoinToADollar, which has recently been trending on twitter, may be a prophesy of what's to come.  2. Dogecoin has strong and unique branding  Branding is important. It influences our purchasing decisions and our sentiment towards products, services, and ideas. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies, so branding matters for public adoption. Bitcoin is at the forefront of the cryptocurrency revolution because of its strong and unique branding.  For Bitcoin to act as its intended purpose as the reserve currency of the world, it cannot be beholden to any state, country, or individual. Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, fortified the integrity of the Bitcoin system by remaining anonymous and never cashing out his early coffers. This, along with its originality and resilience, gives Bitcoin a strong brand foundation.  Similar to Bitcoin, Dogecoin also has strong and unique branding. Dogecoin is symbolized by the Shiba Inu dog meme. Its logo is a cute dog. Other cryptocurrencies don't have a logo as memorable or funny. It's ironic for something so silly like a dog-meme to be associated with such a serious financial asset. It makes a mockery of traditional cryptocurrency networks. Plus, who doesn't love dogs?  Dogecoin's logo is symbolized by its official mascot, a Shiba Inu dog  Propelling the Dogecoin zeal is Elon Musk, who regularly tweets about the coin and previously touted himself as the former CEO of Dogecoin. Decentralized ideas are often helmed by an unofficial but bonafide leader. Satoshi Nakamoto for Bitcoin, u/DeepFuckingValue for GameStop, and now Elon Musk for Dogecoin.  With influential individuals like Elon Musk leading the Dogecoin choir, the cryptocurrency stands to gain from its growing brand popularity as hoards of young people share #DogecoinArmy, #DogecoinToTheMoon, and #DogeToADollar, spreading the meme mania on Reddit, TikTok, and Twitter.  Elon Musk shared this Doge meme on January 28th, 2021 on his Twitter, causing Dogecoin to surge 300%  3. Dogecoin is an anti-establishment movement. This fuels growth.  The GameStop short squeeze has shown us that people are fed up with the financial establishment. Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is a movement away from centralization, and Dogecoin has a role to play in this revolution. Uniting behind a cause like Dogecoin allows regular folks to have a say in what they perceive as valuable. The future is digital and decentralized, and Dogecoin is contributing to this anti-establishment narrative."}, {"upvote": 188, "content": "Since I've been following the blossoming crypto economy for some time now, I won't say that Dogecoin reaching $1,000 is impossible, but I will say that it's highly unlikely.  With a circulating supply of 129 Billion DOGE at present, a price of $1,000 per unit would give Dogecoin a market cap of 129 TRILLION USD.  All money in circulation on planet earth is thought to be around 37 trillion USD in total, so that means Dogecoin would have 4X the value of all money in circulation on planet earth.  Since all money, including assets in the forms of investments, derivatives, and cryptocurrencies is said to exceed $1.2 quadrillion USD, Dogecoin's marketcap would account for approximately 10% of this total value.  Not impossible\\u2026..but not very likely either.  This is not financial advice. It is an opinion born of my own experience and the use of a calculator.  If you found my answer helpful or entertaining, please upvote it. \\ud83d\\ude4f"}, {"upvote": 80, "content": "No. Not any time soon. I'll explain in a point and try to get at the motivation for this question in another.  #1 Why Doge Won't Go to $20  Right now, $DOGE is trading at around $.6 a coin. If you take that and multiply it by the total number of coins in existence, you get to its market capitalization, which is $79 billion (roughly).  If $DOGE were to go to $20, then its market cap would be $2.6 trillion. That's 2.6x Bitcoin's market cap.  That would make it more valuable than the most valuable company in the world, Saudi Aramco (at $2.5 trillion) and Apple (at $2.4 trillion).  Just no. Not going to happen. Certainly not in the next 12 months and not likely in the next 5 years.  #2 The Motivation For This Question  The motivation for this question is simple: if $DOGE were to go to $20, then it would do a little better than 33x.  So, I assume the questioner wants to know whether $DOGE can do at least 30x. The answer is no.  You are too late to this pump. Get over it and choose another one.  There are so many other cryptos out there that could do this\\u2014but you have to go outside the top 10 coins. You'll have to look at those in the 110 - 75 range (ranked by market cap).  My two favorite at or outside the top 100, because they are related to broader ecosystems are:  1. Voyager Token ($VGX) [ https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/voyager-token/ ], which is used for the Voyager Exchange. This exchange is available in the US and actually doesn't rip people off for their trades like Coinbase. It also lets you get interest 10% on your tokens right there (v. Coinbase's top yield of 2%). 2. Flow ($FLOW) [ https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/flow/ ], which is a layer 1 scalable blockchain by the developers of CryptoKitties and TopShot. Will it really beat $ETH? That's unlikely, but it could find a niche space and pump 10x. Ok, so there you go. The above statements are not recommendations for any of these, since the whole space is crazy right now. I just wanted to give you a sense of what it takes to pump even 10x.  The top 100 coins all have a market cap above $1 billion right now! So, those large gains are harder to find.

At press time, the Dogecoin price was up over 20% on Indian crypto exchanges, trading at Rs 16.2325.  Amid a slumping market for cryptocurrency tokens since the start of the New Year, Dogecoin (DOGE) has dropped to $0.1411 (approx. Rs 10.46) on 10th January 2022 according to CoinMarketCap data. Since then, DOGE has been recovering, according to CoinMarketCap data.  Earlier in December 2021, Musk had said such use of dogecoin would be allowed on a test basis, sending the token up more than 20%. Tesla chief's tweets on Dogecoin, where he had referred to the token as \\\"people's crypto,\\\" had caused its price to jump around 4,000 percent in 2021.  To Dogecoin's credit, its market capitalization has sustained the Crypto Games Conference for a couple of years, and its ability to hold such a high value despite months of major price drops makes it one of the top 15 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, despite having only a handful of use cases.  While this development is impressive and may point to Dogecoin having one of the most enthusiastic communities in the cryptocurrency market, it may prove to be a liability in the long term. A community's strength can play a significant role in how well a cryptocurrency performs and how fast it's adopted.  Although Dogecoin was initially met with a positive reception by the cryptocurrency community, it is currently only listed on a few exchanges, which inflate its price and provide limited liquidity. Dogecoin's price has not risen significantly since its inception and is unlikely to do so in the future, as there are other cryptocurrencies that offer greater potential for growth.

On Thursday, Elon Musk own Dogecoin SpaceX and Tesla CEO took to Twitter to share a video in which a TMZ reporter asks him whether he really thinks Dogecoin \\\"could really be Elon Musk own Dogecoin next currency for Elon Musk own Dogecoin world.\\\" In response, Musk flips Elon Musk own Dogecoin question back on Elon Musk own Dogecoin reporter, asking him what he wants. When Elon Musk own Dogecoin reporter says he has high hopes for Dogecoin, Musk then says, \\\"I think it should be Elon Musk own Dogecoin will of Elon Musk own Dogecoin people, Elon Musk own Dogecoin know?\\\" The TMZ reporter presses on with more questions about Dogecoin, asking whether there is a problem with Elon Musk own Dogecoin digital token since there is no limit on its number. Musk responds by saying that there is an issue, and he cautions eager investors to not put \\\"their life savings in cryptocurrency.\\\" I think that's unwise,\\\" he says. \\\"But if Elon Musk own Dogecoin want to ... speculate ... there's a good chance that crypto is Elon Musk own Dogecoin future currency of Elon Musk own Dogecoin Earth.\\\" The question will then become which cryptocurrency will take over, Musk says, while emphasizing that nobody should \\\"go too far on Elon Musk own Dogecoin crypto speculation front.\\\" Later in Elon Musk own Dogecoin interview, he acknowledges there could be an \\\"ironic outcome\\\" in which Dogecoin \\u2014 a cryptocurrency that was initially invented as a joke \\u2014 could become Elon Musk own Dogecoin currency of Elon Musk own Dogecoin future. Perhaps Elon Musk own Dogecoin most interesting part of Elon Musk own Dogecoin interview, however, is toward Elon Musk own Dogecoin end, when a reporter points out that Dogecoin spiked days after Musk tweeted about it. The reporter asks whether Elon Musk own Dogecoin billionaire will tweet about Elon Musk own Dogecoin cryptocurrency again, but Musk shoots Elon Musk own Dogecoin idea down. \\\"Listen, don't take too much risk on crypto,\\\" he says before driving off. Last year, Musk sparked a wave of interest in Dogecoin after he sent a series of tweets about it as joke. The cryptocurrency has since seen a dramatic spike \\u2014 it shot up nearly 40% this past week in Elon Musk own Dogecoin lead-up to Musk's appearance on Saturday Night Live. Still, other investors, like Musk, have issued warnings about Dogecoin, arguing that intense interest could lead to a bubble in Elon Musk own Dogecoin cryptocurrency market. \\\"Dogecoin's rise is a classic example of greater fool theory at play,\\\" David Kimberley, an analyst at U.K. investing app Freetrade, told CNBC recently. \\\"When everyone is [buying Dogecoin], Elon Musk own Dogecoin bubble eventually has to burst and Elon Musk own Dogecoin're going to be left short-changed if Elon Musk own Dogecoin don't get out in time. And it's almost impossible to say when that's going to happen.\\\"Dogecoin is Elon Musk own Dogecoin new Gamestop. At about $0.65 per coin as I type these words, Elon Musk own Dogecoin cryptocurrency that started as a joke is up 5% in Elon Musk own Dogecoin last day and over 13,000% YTD. Part of its rise has been fueled by Elon Musk. A Musk tweet about Dogecoin sends Elon Musk own Dogecoin price up faster than a SpaceX rocket. And with Musk scheduled to host Saturday Night Live this evening, Elon Musk own Dogecoin Dogecoin bulls are hoping that a mention of Elon Musk own Dogecoin cryptocurrency tonight could send Elon Musk own Dogecoin price of Elon Musk own Dogecoin coin even higher. Yet even Musk has urged caution. In a recent tweet, he said that while Dogecoin could be Elon Musk own Dogecoin future of currency, we should invest with caution.Dogecoin is unlimited Much has been said about Elon Musk own Dogecoin 21 million limit on Elon Musk own Dogecoin number of Bitcoin that can be mind. Many justify Elon Musk own Dogecoin current price of Bitcoin based on this cap, comparing it to Elon Musk own Dogecoin seemingly unlimited printing of Elon Musk own Dogecoin U.S. dollar. The argument reminds me of a similar view of real estate back in 2007\\u2014Elon Musk own Dogecoin ain't making more land. We know how that turned out. Even so, Dogecoin is not subject to such limits. In fact, there are already more than 129 billion Dogecoin in existence. The number will only get higher. 2. Dogecoin is useless I'm not making a value judgment here. In theory it could be used as a currency. But it's not. Yes, there are a few things Elon Musk own Dogecoin can buy with a Dogecoin. The Oakland A's made news be selling tickets in exchange for Dogecoin. But that was a marketing stunt. Of course, most cryptocurrencies are useless for anything other than hoping somebody will buy your crypto at some point in Elon Musk own Dogecoin future for more than Elon Musk own Dogecoin paid for it. At least Ethereum has smart contracts and Bitcoin benefits from being first. Dogecoin just sits there. 3. Selling Dogecoin could be tricky In theory, Elon Musk own Dogecoin should be able to buy and sell crypto with a click of a mouse or press of a button. In theory. In reality, it's not always so easy. Whenever volume spikes, Robinhood's platform seems to fold like a lawn chair. It happened with Gamestop, and this past week it happened again when Elon Musk own Dogecoin price of Dogecoin exploded. With Elon Musk own Dogecoin current interest in Dogecoin at an all time high, and Elon Musk headed to 30 Rockefeller Plaza for SNL, one has to wonder just how quickly Elon Musk own Dogecoin can unload Dogecoin. 4. A Dogecoin whale could be lurking Back in February, Elon Musk own Dogecoin WSJ reported that a Dogecoin whale owned about 28% of Elon Musk own Dogecoin cryptocurrency. In today's dollars that amounts to about $25 billion. Given a market cap of less than four times that amount, Elon Musk own Dogecoin whale could easily move Elon Musk own Dogecoin market lower if they decided to sell large blocks of Elon Musk own Dogecoin coin. Some have argued that Elon Musk own Dogecoin stake is held on Robinhood's platform. If that's true, it's worth re-reading #3 above. 5. You can't Invest in Dogecoin Finally, keep in mind that buying Dogecoin is not Elon Musk own Dogecoin same thing as investing in Dogecoin. You can't invest in Dogecoin any more than Elon Musk own Dogecoin can invest in a lottery ticket or a spin of Elon Musk own Dogecoin roulette wheel in Vegas. You can certainly buy Dogecoin and hope and pray that Elon Musk own Dogecoin price goes up. Many have done just that, and some will profit. But Dogecoin is not an investment. There is no reasonable basis to believe that a purchase of Dogecoin will result in more capital after factoring in fees and inflation. And that's what investing is. Investing, when done right, is boring. If Elon Musk own Dogecoin'd like to be bored to wealth, check out Elon Musk own Dogecoin 3-fund portfolio.

We'll guess at why he's doing it in a minute. Let's first focus on what he's doing and what it means for Bitcoin. The current drama started on January 29, 2021. It was on that day that Elon Musk added Elon Musk own Dogecoin hashtag #Bitcoin to his Twitter bio. Bitcoin skyrocketed from $32,000 to $38,000 on Elon Musk own Dogecoin news. So much for fundamentals. Two days later in a Clubhouse chat he described Bitcoin as a good thing: I do at this point think bitcoin is a good thing, and I am a supporter of bitcoin. Then in February Tesla disclosed in an SEC filing that Elon Musk own Dogecoin electric carmaker had purchased $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. It also announced that it would begin accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment. During much of this time, however, Musk's tweets focused far more attention on Dogecoin, not Bitcoin. As just one of many examples:Perhaps we should have seen Elon Musk own Dogecoin writing on Elon Musk own Dogecoin moon at this point. In Elon Musk own Dogecoin months that followed, Bitcoin rose to a high of over $63,000. Still a volatile asset, it dropped back into a range in Elon Musk own Dogecoin mid-50s until this tweet heard round Elon Musk own Dogecoin world:In a subsequent tweet, Musk clarified his position on crypto: To be clear, I strongly believe in crypto, but it can't drive a massive increase in fossil fuel use, especially coal.  In retrospect, it does seem curious that a car company dedicated to clean energy would stand behind a digital asset Elon Musk own Dogecoin mining of which consumes more electricity than Argentina. There are of course valid arguments about its carbon footprint. And many compare Bitcoin's energy consumption to everything from gold mining to powering Christmas lights.  Yet it can't be denied that a significant amount of Bitcoin mining is powered by coal. As reported by Fortune, a flood shut down a coal mine in China and halted one-third of Bitcoin's global computing power. Musk took note:It may be a bit premature to conclude that a cryptocurrency not old enough to drive will displace a commodity dating back over 5,000 years. And given that Bitcoin can't function as a currency in any practical sense, one has to wonder just how useful it is or ever will be.  And all of that brings us back to Elon Musk. He now seems to be long on Dogecoin and short on Bitcoin. Why Elon Musk own Dogecoin change of heart on Bitcoin?  One answer may be that Tesla's Board of Directors influenced his thinking. The problem here, however, is that they would no doubt have been notified about Elon Musk own Dogecoin company's decision to buy $1.5 billion of Elon Musk own Dogecoin token earlier this year. Why didn't they object then?  Perhaps Occam's razor provides Elon Musk own Dogecoin best answer. Musk came to appreciate that Bitcoin consumes an enormous amount of energy, much of it from coal. At Elon Musk own Dogecoin same time, Bitcoin's blockchain is incredibly inefficient, rendering Elon Musk own Dogecoin token all but useless as a practical currency. The result is a cryptocurrency that is both bad for Elon Musk own Dogecoin environment and virtually useless in any practical applications.  In contrast, other tokens are for more efficient in both energy consumption and transaction processing. And advances in blockchain technology can drive even more efficiencies as we will see, for example, with Ethereum 2.  If this explains his reversal on Bitcoin, it still doesn't answer why he only now came to these conclusions that have been obvious for some time. It also doesn't answer whether his next Tweet will yet again reverse his stance on Bitcoin.  So what does this mean for Elon Musk own Dogecoin future of Bitcoin. Everything and nothing at all. Musk has certainly shined a light on Elon Musk own Dogecoin shortcomings of Bitcoin. In that sense, he's done us all a good service. History won't be kind to Bitcoin.  In Elon Musk own Dogecoin long term, however, he may have little influence over Elon Musk own Dogecoin token. If Elon Musk own Dogecoin current market has taught us anything, it's that news ages fast. Remember Gamestop?  Keeping track of investments isn't getting any easier.

On Thursday, Elon Musk own Dogecoin SpaceX and also Tesla CEO got to Twitter to talk about a video inside which a TMZ reporter asks him whether or not he actually thinks Dogecoin \\\"could actually function as following currency of Elon Musk own Dogecoin world.\\\" In response, Musk turns Elon Musk own Dogecoin issue returned along Elon Musk own Dogecoin reporter, asking him what he wants. If Elon Musk own Dogecoin reporter states he has excessive hopes for Dogecoin, Musk then simply says, \\\"I believe that it needs to become Elon Musk own Dogecoin will of Elon Musk own Dogecoin people, Elon Musk own Dogecoin know?\\\" The TMZ reporter presses on with increased questions about Dogecoin, asking whether or not there's a problem with Elon Musk own Dogecoin digital token since there is absolutely no limit on Elon Musk own Dogecoin number of its. Musk does respond by stating that there's an issue, and also he cautions enthusiastic investors to not have \\\"their living savings in cryptocurrency.\\\" It is my opinion that's unwise,\\\" he says. \\\"But in case Elon Musk own Dogecoin wish to... speculate... there is a high probability which crypto is Elon Musk own Dogecoin future currency around Elon Musk own Dogecoin Earth.\\\" The issue will then end up what cryptocurrency usually takes over, Musk claims, while emphasizing that nobody must \\\"go too far on Elon Musk own Dogecoin crypto speculation front.\\\" Later inside Elon Musk own Dogecoin employment interview, he recognizes presently there could be an \\\"ironic outcome\\\" whereby Dogecoin - a cryptocurrency that has been in Elon Musk own Dogecoin beginning developed as a joke - might become Elon Musk own Dogecoin currency belonging to Elon Musk own Dogecoin future. Perhaps Elon Musk own Dogecoin most intriguing part of Elon Musk own Dogecoin interview, nonetheless, is to Elon Musk own Dogecoin conclusion, if a reporter explains which Dogecoin spiked days or weeks after Musk tweeted over it. The reporter asks whether Elon Musk own Dogecoin billionaire is going to tweet approximately Elon Musk own Dogecoin cryptocurrency again, but Musk shoots Elon Musk own Dogecoin idea down. \\\"Listen, don't take an excess amount of danger on crypto,\\\" he states before traveling raised a few inches off. Lastly year, Musk sparked a trend of interest in Dogecoin after he sent many tweets about it as laugh. The cryptocurrency has since seen a significant spike - it shot up about 40 % this kind of prior week in Elon Musk own Dogecoin lead up to Musk's appearance on Saturday Night Live. Still, some other investors, like Musk, have released warnings about Dogecoin, arguing that intensive interest might cause a bubble in Elon Musk own Dogecoin cryptocurrency market. \\\"Dogecoin's rise is a standard instance of higher fool principle at play,\\\" David Kimberley, an analyst at U.K. committing app Freetrade, told CNBC recently. \\\"When everybody is [buying Dogecoin], Elon Musk own Dogecoin bubble gradually must burst plus Elon Musk own Dogecoin're likely to be still available short changed when Elon Musk own Dogecoin do not get out in time. And it's nearly impossible to state when that's likely to happen.\\\"Dogecoin will be Elon Musk own Dogecoin latest Gamestop. At aproximatelly $0.65 per coin as I kind these phrases, Elon Musk own Dogecoin cryptocurrency which launched as a laugh is up five % within Elon Musk own Dogecoin previous working day and more than 13,000 % YTD. Component of its rise is fueled by Elon Musk. A Musk tweet about Dogecoin sends Elon Musk own Dogecoin price up a lot faster than a SpaceX rocket. With Musk scheduled to host Saturday Night Live this nighttime, Elon Musk own Dogecoin Dogecoin bulls are with Elon Musk own Dogecoin hope that a mention on Elon Musk own Dogecoin cryptocurrency tonight might transmit Elon Musk own Dogecoin price on Elon Musk own Dogecoin coin even higher. Still possibly even Musk has urged caution. Using a recent tweet, he declared while Dogecoin could be Elon Musk own Dogecoin long term future of currency, we've got to devlote with caution.Dogecoin is unrestricted Much appears to have been reported about Elon Musk own Dogecoin 21 million maximum on Elon Musk own Dogecoin volume of Bitcoin that may be mind. Many justify today's cost of Bitcoin based on this cap, comparing it with Elon Musk own Dogecoin seemingly limitless printing on Elon Musk own Dogecoin U.S. dollar. The argument reminds me of a similar view of real estate in 2007 - Elon Musk own Dogecoin ain't making a lot more land. We all know exactly how that ended up. Still, Dogecoin is not subject to this sort of limitations. In fact, right now there happen to be more than 129 billion Dogecoin in existence. The amount will only get higher. 2. Dogecoin is ineffective I am not making a value judgment in this article. In theory it could be utilized as being a currency. But it's not. Sure, there are a few factors Elon Musk own Dogecoin can purchase with a Dogecoin. The Oakland A's manufactured news be selling tickets in return for Dogecoin. But everything above was a marketing stunt. Of course, Elon Musk own Dogecoin majority of cryptocurrencies are useless for whatever other than wishing someone will purchase your crypto eventually inside Elon Musk own Dogecoin future for much more than Elon Musk own Dogecoin paid out because of it. At a minimum Ethereum has shrewd contracts as well as Bitcoin benefits out of simply being initially. Dogecoin just is situated there. three. Selling Dogecoin might be confusing In theory, Elon Musk own Dogecoin will be able to buy and market crypto using a press of a mouse or press of a button. Theoretically. In truth, it's not necessarily really easy. Anytime amount surges, Robinhood's platform seems to fold as a lawn chair. It happened with Gamestop, and this also earlier week it happened again as soon as Elon Musk own Dogecoin selling price of Dogecoin skyrocketed. together with Elon Musk own Dogecoin present interest in Dogecoin in a just about all point in time extremely high, and Elon Musk headed to thirty Rockefeller Plaza for SNL, an individual must wonder precisely how quickly Elon Musk own Dogecoin are able to unload Dogecoin. 4. A Dogecoin whale may very well be lurking Back in February, Elon Musk own Dogecoin WSJ found that a Dogecoin whale owned and operated about 28 % of all Elon Musk own Dogecoin money taken in and most of Elon Musk own Dogecoin cryptocurrency. In today's dollars which amounts to about $25 billion. Presented a market cap of less than 4 occasions that quantity, Elon Musk own Dogecoin whale might effortlessly shift Elon Musk own Dogecoin market lower in case they decided to sell large blocks belonging to Elon Musk own Dogecoin coin. A few people have argued Elon Musk own Dogecoin stake is kept on Robinhood's wedge. If that's correct, it's worthy of re-reading #3 above. five. You cannot Purchase Dogecoin Finally, retain in your thoughts which purchasing Dogecoin isn't Elon Musk own Dogecoin same thing as investing in Dogecoin. You cannot spend money on Dogecoin any kind of much more than Elon Musk own Dogecoin can devlote in a lottery ticket or maybe a spin on Elon Musk own Dogecoin roulette steering wheel in Vegas. You are able to definitely get Dogecoin and pray and hope which Elon Musk own Dogecoin cost moves upwards. Many have caused that, and quite a few will profit. But Dogecoin is not really an investment.

On January 29, 2021 was started by Elon Musk own Dogecoin current drama. It was on that morning that Elon Musk put in Elon Musk own Dogecoin hashtag #Bitcoin to Elon Musk own Dogecoin Twitter bio of his. Bitcoin skyrocketed from $32,000 to $38,000 within Elon Musk own Dogecoin media. A lot for fundamentals.

Then in February Tesla disclosed inside an SEC submitting that Elon Musk own Dogecoin electrical carmaker had obtained $1.5 billion found Bitcoin. In addition, it announced that it would start processing Bitcoin as a kind of charge. Throughout much of this moment, nonetheless, Musk's tweets concentrated far more awareness on Dogecoin, not Bitcoin. As merely one of several examples:Perhaps we should have seen Elon Musk own Dogecoin writing on Elon Musk own Dogecoin moon in this point. In Elon Musk own Dogecoin months which put into practice, Bitcoin rose to an impressive of more than $63,000. Still a volatile resource, it dropped back to a selection in Elon Musk own Dogecoin mid 50s until this tweet heard round Elon Musk own Dogecoin world:In a subsequent tweet, Musk clarified his role on crypto: For being apparent, I strongly believe in crypto, though it cannot operate a massive rise in fossil fuel consumption, especially coal.  On Thursday, Elon Musk own Dogecoin SpaceX and Tesla CEO took to Twitter to share a video clip within what a TMZ reporter asks him if he really believes Dogecoin \\\"could actually function as Elon Musk own Dogecoin next currency of Elon Musk own Dogecoin world.\\\" In response, Musk turns Elon Musk own Dogecoin problem returned over Elon Musk own Dogecoin reporter, asking him what he desires.

It does allow Elon Musk own Dogecoin to track Elon Musk own Dogecoin value of a variety of assets, such as domain names. It connects to major cryptocurrency exchanges, and provides a feature to keep track of insurance policies.  Unlike Personal Capital, however, it does not provide any meaningful data on asset allocation. It also doesn't come with a retirement planner or fee analyzer. Still, it is very easy to use with a clean interface. I'm hopeful that they will continue to add features to Elon Musk own Dogecoin tool over time.  Google Sheets  Finally, Google Sheets makes it easy to track a portfolio. With Google finance functions Elon Musk own Dogecoin can pull in information on stocks, ETFs and mutual funds. For example, it's easy to pull in fund names, expense ratios, current price and performance. Here's a free spreadsheet one can use to track their investments.  I use Elon Musk own Dogecoin spreadsheet primarily for rebalancing purposes. It's easy to see which asset classes are significantly above or below Elon Musk own Dogecoin target allocation. It even indicates exactly how much needs to be moved to or from each asset class to rebalance back to Elon Musk own Dogecoin target allocation.  Before picking an app or website to track your stocks and other investments, it's important to understand what Elon Musk own Dogecoin are trying to accomplish. As an initial matter, decide whether Elon Musk own Dogecoin want to connect your brokerage accounts with Elon Musk own Dogecoin app. From there, consider whether Elon Musk own Dogecoin just want to track balances and performance, or if Elon Musk own Dogecoin want additional features such as asset allocation tools, retirement planning and fee analysis. From here Elon Musk own Dogecoin should be able to to find an investment tool to meet your needs.  The Internal Revenue Service has announced new, higher contribution limits for health savings accounts for 2022. Are Elon Musk own Dogecoin maxing out these benefits?  At Elon Musk own Dogecoin end of January, Americans held $82.2 billion in 30 million health savings accounts, according to HSA advisory firm Devenir. That's a year-over-year increase of 25% for HSA assets and a 6% increase for Elon Musk own Dogecoin number of accounts. HSA investment assets soared to an estimated $23.8 billion at Elon Musk own Dogecoin end of December, up 52% year-over-year. On average, investment account holders had a $17,926 total balance (cash deposits and investments combined). That's 6.5 times Elon Musk own Dogecoin average account balance of $2,737 for account holders who hold cash deposits only. Just 6% of account holders are investing a portion of their HSA dollars\\u2014according to Devenir's 2020 year-end HSA report\\u2014representing a missed opportunity for big, long-term savings.  HSAs are Elon Musk own Dogecoin best way to save courtesy of Uncle Sam, with triple tax benefits. You put money in on a taxfree basis (usually through salary deferrals), it builds up tax free (Elon Musk own Dogecoin can invest it), and it comes out taxfree to cover out-of-pocket healthcare expenses. It's a great deal whether Elon Musk own Dogecoin use Elon Musk own Dogecoin money in Elon Musk own Dogecoin account for current out-of-pocket healthcare expenses, or invest it with Elon Musk own Dogecoin intention of using it to help cover your healthcare costs in retirement.  IRS Revenue Procedure 2021-25 has Elon Musk own Dogecoin official numbers for 2022: You can contribute $3,650 for individual coverage, up from $3,600 for 2021, or $7,300 for family coverage, up from $7,200 for 2021 into an HSA. If Elon Musk own Dogecoin're 55-plus, Elon Musk own Dogecoin can sock away an additional $1,000 a year. That catch-up amount isn't subject to inflation adjustments.  You can contribute to an HSA if Elon Musk own Dogecoin're in a qualifying high-deductible health plan. For 2022, that means a plan with a minimum annual deductible of $1,400 for individual coverage or $2,800 for family coverage. Out-of-pocket maximums are $7,050 for individual coverage and $14,100 for family coverage for 2022.  How much should Elon Musk own Dogecoin contribute? At a minimum, Elon Musk own Dogecoin should contribute enough to cover your deductible. Got an unexpected doctor's bill? You can put money into your HSA, take it right out, and Elon Musk own Dogecoin government just paid 25% of Elon Musk own Dogecoin bill. (The higher your tax bracket, Elon Musk own Dogecoin bigger your savings.) Thanks to a Covid-19-tax relief provision, Elon Musk own Dogecoin can use money Elon Musk own Dogecoin stash in an HSA for over-Elon Musk own Dogecoin-counter medications like Tylenol or Flonase as well as menstrual products like tampons and pads.  Are Elon Musk own Dogecoin investing your HSA dollars? The real juice to an HSA is use it as a retirement savings kitty. You can invest and let your money grow for decades tax-free, so long as Elon Musk own Dogecoin, or a surviving spouse, eventually use it for medical expenses. An HSA can even serve as a backup rainy-day fund; if Elon Musk own Dogecoin suddenly need cash, Elon Musk own Dogecoin can take money out tax-free to reimburse yourself for any prior years' medical expenses paid from outside Elon Musk own Dogecoin account. Plus, once Elon Musk own Dogecoin turn 65, Elon Musk own Dogecoin can withdraw money for non-medical uses, paying Elon Musk own Dogecoin same tax as Elon Musk own Dogecoin would on withdrawals from a pretax 401(k).  In Elon Musk own Dogecoin meantime, Elon Musk own Dogecoin can still top off health savings account contributions for tax year 2020 through Elon Musk own Dogecoin Covid-19-related extended tax day deadline of May 17, 2021. Also, check that your 2021 contributions are on track.  Most HSAs are offered as an employee benefit. So when workplace open enrollment comes around, that time Elon Musk own Dogecoin're picking your health care benefits for 2022, pay special attention to your HSA choices. Some employers even pitch in and contribute to your account (Elon Musk own Dogecoin average employer contribution was $870 for those making contributions, Devenir found, worth mentioning to your HR department). If Elon Musk own Dogecoin're self-employed, Elon Musk own Dogecoin can set up an account at Fidelity or Lively, which both offer fee-free HSAs for individuals. If Elon Musk own Dogecoin're stuck in a dud HSA with high fees or if Elon Musk own Dogecoin've left a job that offered an HSA, note that Elon Musk own Dogecoin can move your old HSA to a new provider.  Don't confuse HSAs with healthcare FSAs (sometimes confusingly called health spending accounts). FSAs have lower contribution limits and are riskier because typically Elon Musk own Dogecoin have to spend Elon Musk own Dogecoin money down in one year or Elon Musk own Dogecoin forfeit it, although some FSAs have a $550 carryover provision. Congress loosened Elon Musk own Dogecoin carryover rules for FSAs because of Elon Musk own Dogecoin coronavirus pandemic. By contrast, Elon Musk own Dogecoin money Elon Musk own Dogecoin put in an HSA is yours to keep forever: Elon Musk own Dogecoin can spend it when Elon Musk own Dogecoin want. If Elon Musk own Dogecoin have an HSA-eligible health plan, Elon Musk own Dogecoin can't also put away money in a regular FSA but Elon Musk own Dogecoin can put money in a limited FSA for dental and vision care expenses only."}, {"upvote": 2, "content": "The ownership of DOGE is wide open [ https://www.google.com/search?q=doge+whitepaper&rlz=1C1GCEB_enUS815US815&oq=doge+whitepaper&aqs=chrome..69i57.2287j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 ] and not at all in dispute.

I think its primary use (right now) is as a store of value\\u2014and it may beat Bitcoin at that. Let's look at both points.  #1 As A Form of Payment  Though Doge was made as a joke, it runs on fundamentally the same technology as Bitcoin (at least until Bitcoin's Taproot upgrade in Nov. of 2021 [ https://www.coindesk.com/locked-in-bitcoin-taproot-upgrade-gets-activation-mandate ]).  That means it can be used as a form of payment where it is accepted. It's also more eco-friendly than Bitcoin.  Here are just five companies of more than 48 that accept it right now [ https://www.ibtimes.com/these-48-companies-accept-dogecoin-payment-3161086 ].  1 Dallas Mavericks  I hope you don't need an explanation about the Dallas Mavs. The point is that you can buy their season tickets and merchandise with DOGE.  https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1368276718860046339?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1368276718860046339%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsweek.com%2Fwhich-companies-are-accepting-dogecoin-payment-dallas-mavericks-airbaltic-post-oak-motor-cars-1584787 2 Post Oak Motor Cars  This is a high-end car shop, known for selling Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and the like.  3 The Kessler Collection  This is a luxury hotel chain in the US that will accept DOGE for payment. They partnered with BitPay.  4 AirBaltic  Yes, the airline company focused on the Baltic region allows you to purchase tickets with DOGE  5 EasyDNS  This is the Canadian internet service provider. It also accepts Bitcoin and Ethereum, so that you can pay for your internet surfing in cryptos.  That's just really a small sample. But it does give you an idea of the growing number of companies that accept DOGE.  Still, I don't think this is DOGE's main purpose right now. That is point two.  #2 As A Store of Value  Bitcoin is best known as a store of value. Here's its chart over the last six months.  That is a fantastic 111% return in 6 months.  Here is Doge's chart.  That is a 10,000% return or the fabled 100x! Needless to say, DOGE is clobbering Bitcoin.  What you are witnessing is a re-valuation of Doge's position in the cryptocurrency world. Currently, it is the top meme coin, but I think that it'll end up taking a top spot as a store of value coin.  Where could it go from here?   * Well, if it did 5x, it would be at 66% of Ethereum's current value.  * If it did 7.14x, it would meet Ethereum's current value.  * To do 10x, it would have to meet about what Ethereum was at in early May. All of those seem reasonable targets if this bull-run continues up.  Happy Trading!!

It can get stable income every day. Do you want to know more about it? gentlemen"}, {"upvote": 2, "content": "The main problem with Dogecoin is that the currency is uncapped.  You see, to make profit, you are betting on price fluctuations. [math]Price= Market Capital/Circulating Supply[/math]  In Layman's terms, the price of the currency is how much money there is total in it, divided by how many of it exist. When demand for a currency goes up \\u25b2, more people add money into it (market capital increases) but the circulating supply doesn't grow by the same rate because of limitations, so the price increases. This is why some cryptocurrencies increase in value over time.  Different cryptocurrencies have different limitations. To understand that, we need to understand how cryptocurrencies are created in the first place. For Bitcoin for example, new Bitcoins are created when mining. When a miner witnesses and verifies a transaction, he receives a reward for his work and the circulating supply increases. However, this issue was forethought, as that Bitcoin supply does not increase too fast so a number of limitations were put in place: Bitcoin mining rewards halves over time, this is known as Bitcoin halving.  In another example, Ethereum employs a different strategy known as token burning. Where a number of tokens are burnt to decrease circulating supply to keep prices relatively stable.  Most currencies have different mechanisms that support the purpose they are used for. This makes them feasible to be for the purpose they were created for. As has Bitcoin been on the Silk Road for buying different items. Or as different currencies can be used on the crypto-commerce platforms like exeno or solana pay that allow you to buy things with crypto in real time, the former being specialized and newer and the latter being supported by major financial influencers like Chamath Palihapitiya.  This is where the issues with Dogecoin come into question. You see Dogecoin in its inception was only created as a \\u2018memecoin' or a drawn-out joke. I'm sorry to say this, but the developers behind DOGE did not think this far ahead and assume it would reach where it has gotten, and a number of issues have halted its performance.  The fact that Dogecoin is uncapped is issue. The more Doge you buy, the more there will be, and the supply is only limited by how fast people can mine it. In this lag time, and this latency period, demand beats supply and price increases. Though this never last long-term and prices drop quickly soon after.  This is what happened with people who held dogecoin at 0.1, watched it go up to 0.7, then drop back down. The longer you hold it, the sooner the supply will catch up to you. Before this issue is fixed, holding DOGEcoin is outside the question.  From my own bias I would say: Don't hold it for more than 2\\u20133 months tops, even if you have to sell at a loss. If you can turn a profit from it, be satisfied with whatever you can get.  The fact that it has 0 use case and runs only on hype does not help its case.

Now it is, at times, over 400 minutes, and only below 50 minutes at certain times of the day.

Worse still, the network is on the brink of technical collapse. The mechanisms that should have prevented this outcome have broken down, and as a result there's no longer much reason to think Bitcoin can actually be better than the existing financial system.

I'm going to hazard a guess that the answer is no.  Bitcoin has literally been technologically surpassed by other currencies that use components of Bitcoin that work, and improve upon them. Dogecoin is one, Dash is another, Ripple another, Ethereum another, Litecoin another.

Two guys, Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus who loved the famous \\\"Doge\\\" internet meme wanted to make it famous. So they created a copy of an existing coin called Litecoin and tweaked it to give a dog based fun vibe outlook 2. This process of making a copy of an existing coin and tweaking it to create a new product is called a fork in crypto. This fork called Dogecoin was never meant to be taken seriously or have a huge market cap. It was created by crypto enthusiasts just to have fun. 3. Dogecoin was used for something called tipping mainly on Reddit. Since it had a super low cost, Redditors started micro-tipping each other as a token of appreciation for their effort and Dogecoin coin became famous on Reddit 4. After the whole scene of Redditors pumping Gamestop, in the last quarter of 2020 Dogecoin again gained alot of traction especially due to the Meme Crypto Lord Elon Musk started posting tweets on Dogecoin. He was then followed by the likes of other Internet personalities like Snoop Dog posting about this meme currency 5. And then this meme crypto coin blew out of proportion and entered the top 10 cryptos by market share making a lot of early memers holding the coin alot of money and attracted masses to invest into crypto. This coin went from tipping Redditors to donations for good causes strengthening the Fun vibe narrative of Dogecoin 6. The coin itself is doing nothing extra-ordinary in terms of technological breakthroughs but has a huge support base pushing for the success of a meme driven, fun vibe, good cause coin that is held in majority by top 10 wallets making it a risky investment What is Shiba Inu Token?  1. With the massive success of a dog based meme coin, in came Shiba Inu token which claimed itself to be a DogeKiller. Let's see what this Doge Killer had up its sleeve 2. While doing our research we realised that most people look for Shiba Inu \\\"coin\\\", which is misleading as it is a token. Let us explain you what the difference is 3. So I assume looking at our previous two videos you already know what a blockchain is. Bitcoin is a blockchain, Ethereum is a blockchain, Our India's own Polygon is a blockchain and even Dogecoin has its own blockchain. Each blockchain has a coin from where Ether, Matic, Dogecoin come. 4. On some of these blockchains, there exist tokens that act like a coin but are not a coin as they do not help the blockchain but just use its power, features and security. Shiba Inu is a token on the Ethereum blockchain created by an anonymous person going by the name \\\"Ryoshi\\\" and calling itself the \\\"Dogecoin killer\\\" 5. Let's understand why Shiba Inu claims it to be a Dogecoin killer? As Dogecoin was a fork of Litecoin and started as a meme, it did not have the ability to use smart contracts while the Shiba Inu token being on Ethereum can leverage smart contracts to create it's utility like allowing you to lend it out to others, swap it for other tokens, create dApps and more. Shiba Inu is able to do few extra things that Dogecoin is not able to, thus claiming itself to be the Dogecoin killer. 6. Shiba Inu tried various marketing hacks to gain traction like sending half of the Tokens to Vitalik who from our previous video you may recollect is the creator of Ethereum. He donated 10% of these tokens to charity and burnt 90% of them. They got onboard famous tiktok creators to make people buy the tokens and raise it's popularity and rewarded Shiba Inu holder who deposited their tokens in bank-like pools called liquidity pools - comment down below if you want us to explain what are liquidity pools and how you can make money with them 7. This caught on and the price exponentially rose in the last 5 months taking another meme cryptocurrency into top 15 coins by market cap. Key takeaway  1. Both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu token have kept their prices super low in fractions of a penny. This gave a lot of new investors a feel like they are getting in early and if these coins ever reach the price of a bitcoin they'll make a fortune which is absolutely FALSE 2. Lets understand how price is actually determined, it is market cap divided by circulating supply. Today in December 2021, the market cap of Shiba Inu is 26 Billion and a price of $0.000045. To reach a price of $1 it would need a market cap of 575 Trillion dollars which is more than 145 times the GDP of India. 3. Similarly, for Dogecoin to reach $100, it would need a market cap of 15 Trillion dollars which is given the supply remains constant. This just explains how the true nature of a coin's growth is Market cap and not it's price 4. Hence be mindful while investing, make sure to judge the market cap and not the coin price.

Dogecoin (DOGE) is a decentralised, peer-to-peer, open-source cryptocurrency derived from the Litecoin blockchain. Like most cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin is based on blockchain technology and functions on cryptographic principles using a proof-of-work algorithm. When a new block is formed in the chain, two cryptographic keys are created: a public and a private key. The public key allows users to view information about the block, while the private key provides access to the owner of the formed block.  Dogecoin is also a mineable digital currency. If you're looking for the best cryptocurrency to mine in 2020, please read our blog.  Dogecoin's block production rate is 6 minutes. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, that's pretty fast, making Dogecoin a great tool for payments and money transfers.  Dogecoin's pros and cons  Among its pros, Dogecoin is a much better means of payment than, for example, Bitcoin, even though Bitcoin's main purpose is to be a payment method. Dogecoin is also a great way to make payments online. Other advantages that set Dogecoin apart from other cryptocurrencies include the following:   * Dogecoin perfectly fits investors who don't have enough capital to invest in more expensive cryptocurrencies. It allows newcomers to get to know the cryptocurrency market and gain necessary experience.  * Dogecoin allows fast, cheap transactions.  * It has a very active community. The cryptocurrency originally conceived as a joke has functioned since 2013 and is gradually gaining popularity. It sees stable, albeit slow, growth, and even counts Elon Musk among its fans.  * Dogecoin ranks among top 50 cryptocurrencies in market capitalisation, which suggests its high stability and trust.  * There are no problems with scaling, unlike most other cryptocurrencies.  * DOGE's transaction speed is very high and has extremely low commission rates.  * Many exchanges and online platforms support Dogecoin.

The cryptocurrency does not boast many unique qualities, elements or technological solutions, and its last update took place back in 2015. Despite that, this cryptocurrency performs well and has a very welcoming and vibrant community, with Elon Musk as a top supporter. Given that the cryptocurrency market constantly sees an influx of new participants, newcomers' interest in Dogecoin is unlikely to wane. Let's look to the future and analyse the probable scenarios of Dogecoin's mid-term and long-term price prediction from cryptocurrency experts for 2020, 2021, 2025 and 2030.  Trading Beasts Dogecoin (DOGE) price prediction for 2020, 2021, 2023, 2025, 2030  Per Trading Beasts' DOGE price prediction, Dogecoin's price will rise in the coming years. They predict that its price may grow to $0.005 by January 2021. Trading Beasts predicts that Dogecoin's price in 2021 may trade within the $0.004\\u20130.0063 range. For 2022, they expect the trading range to expand to $0.0043\\u20130.007. By 2023, Dogecoin should grow further and establish $0.005 as the lowest possible price and $0.008 as the highest."}, {"upvote": 2, "content": "Depends.

Thank me later.  The next big thing  Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency [ https://www.cnet.com/news/blockchain-explained-builds-trust-when-you-need-it-most/ ], a form of digital money that, much like bitcoin [ https://www.cnet.com/tags/bitcoin/ ], enables peer-to-peer transactions across a decentralized network. One important difference: bitcoin is the original blockchain proof-of-concept. Bitcoin is ground-breaking. Bitcoin is (some believe) world-changing tech with the potential to transform how money works in the 21st century.  Dogecoin is a digital coin with a picture of dog on it.  \\\"It is a puzzle to me why Dogecoin is so highly valued,\\\" says Adrian Lee, a senior finance lecturer at the University of Technology in Sydney.  At one point Dogecoin was worth $2 billion. It's difficult to make sense of that.  \\\"Dogecoin is an easily replicable coin,\\\" Lee said. \\\"I don't know how it distinguishes itself from Bitcoin. I really think it has to do with being established early.  \\\"And also the dog.\\\"  If you've spent any time on the internet during the last decade, you've probably heard of the Doge meme [ http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doge ]. The iconic Shibe, his inner monologue expressed in comic sans with broken modifiers: \\\"so scare,\\\" \\\"much noble,\\\" \\\"wow.\\\"  At the peak of the meme's popularity near the tail end of 2013, Palmer, an Australian marketer for one of the world's largest tech companies, made a joke combining two of the internet's most talked-about topics: cryptocurrency and Doge. It was a joke taking aim at the bizarre world of crypto and bitcoin's multiple derivatives.  \\\"Investing in Dogecoin,\\\" Palmer tweeted, \\\"pretty sure it's the next big thing.\\\"  The tweet got a lot of attention.  For laughs, Palmer decided to keep the joke going. He bought the Dogecoin [ http://Dogecoin.com ] domain and uploaded a photoshopped Shibe on a coin.  He left a note on the site: If you want to make Dogecoin a reality, get in touch.  Animal Crossing, featuring the in-game currency \\\"Bells\\\".Nintendo  The bell tolls  On the other side of the world, Billy Markus, a video game-obsessed software engineer at IBM [ https://www.cnet.com/tags/ibm/ ], saw Palmer's note. He'd just finished \\\"Bells\\\", a project he was working on in his spare time.  Bells was a cryptocurrency named after money used in the Nintendo [ https://www.cnet.com/tags/nintendo/ ] game Animal Crossing. It was 2013, the original crypto gold rush. Markus saw that bitcoin's code was open-source. He decided to take a weekend and do something weird. He tried to create his own cryptocurrency for \\\"sillies,\\\" as he put it.  Bells was weird as hell. The major difference between Bells and regular cryptocurrencies was the rewards: they were completely random. If you mined bitcoin, using a decently powerful home computer, the rewards were consistent.  CNET DAILY NEWS  Stay in the know. Get the latest tech stories from CNET News every weekday.  SIGN ME UP!

You may unsubscribe at any time.  If you mined Bells, there was no telling whether the reward would be one Bell or 500 Bells.  And that's because Bells wasn't meant to be serious, it was a digital currency based on a video game about animals who live in a village and go fishing together.  The cryptocurrency community didn't really get the joke.  \\\"People were just trashing it,\\\" laughs Markus, who quickly discovered there was very little crossover between crypto-obsessives and gamers.  \\\"I was like alright, I retire,\\\" says Markus. \\\"I don't need to do this anymore.\\\"  But then Markus read Palmer's message on Dogecoin [ http://Dogecoin.com ]. That was the moment Billy Markus decided to come out of crypto retirement.  Ctrl+F bitcoin  When Palmer didn't immediately respond to Markus' offer to help build Dogecoin, he started working on it anyway.  \\\"Dogecoin,\\\" says Markus, \\\"from 'that seems like it's funny' to actually doing it, took about three hours. It's almost trivial to create a new cryptocurrency.\\\"  It was a find-and-replace job.  Ctrl+F 'Bitcoin,' replace with 'Dogecoin.'  Markus freely admits to finding large chunks of bitcoin's source code completely incomprehensible, but knew enough to change a few core elements for Dogecoin. For example, Markus created 100 billion dogecoins (as opposed to bitcoin's 21 million) and made them easier to mine. (Dogecoin is already close to being mined out, while bitcoin's final coin will be mined in 2140.)  He changed the font (to comic sans of course) and changed every mention of the word 'mine' to 'dig' (because dogs don't mine, they dig...).  And then, during his lunch break, Markus set Dogecoin live.  Moving at light speed  Premining: the act of gathering cryptocurrency before launching your coin into the public domain. Almost everyone serious about launching a cryptocurrency does this.  But Markus and Palmer didn't premine any Dogecoin. Because they weren't serious about launching a cryptocurrency.  \\\"We thought it was this big joke that would die off,\\\" laughs Palmer.  And according to Markus, Palmer wasn't even sure how to mine a cryptocurrency.  Markus had a relatively powerful gaming [ https://www.cnet.com/games/ ] PC, with two graphics cards, so he was officially the first person to mine Dogecoin. But given the the nature of mining (which gets increasingly difficult as the currency is mined) Billy's computer was no longer powerful enough to mine Dogecoin after about five minutes. Markus split what he'd mined 50-50 with Palmer and that was that. Both got about $5,000 of Dogecoin.  And that's all the Dogecoin either man would ever own.  In online crypto circles, Dogecoin became popular very quickly. Forum threads moved rapidly. The name Dogecoin echoed throughout dark corners of the internet.  But Reddit [ https://www.cnet.com/tags/reddit/ ] was almost certainly the main driver in Dogecoin's rapid rise to crypto stardom. The Dogecoin subreddit exploded almost immediately, and with that explosion came the infrastructure any cryptocurrency needs if it is to become successful: mining pools, services.  \\\"It was moving at light speed,\\\" explains Markus. \\\"Within minutes we were like, 'Wow, this is way out of our control.\\\"  But it was the Reddit \\\"tipping bot\\\" that drove Dogecoin into the stratosphere.  If a user posted something to the effect of, \\\"hey 'dogebot' tip this person five dogecoin,\\\" that Reddit user would automatically receive five Dogecoin. People were sending Dogecoin back and forth in a feel-good exercise that cost very little money in real-world terms.  \\\"I liked it,\\\" says Markus. \\\"At the time, Dogecoin wasn't worth anything, but getting five Dogecoin felt better than getting two cents.\\\"  Reddit users were sharing Dogecoin back and forth constantly, which expanded the user base of Dogecoin and, as a result, increased its value as a cryptocurrency.  \\\"Pretty much everyone who used Reddit had Dogecoin,\\\" says Palmer. \\\"I think that was key to its success.\\\"  The 2014 Jamaican bobsled team, holding Dogecoin t-shirts.Crowdtilt  A force for good  January 2014. Jackson Palmer is already three drinks deep at a trivia night at his local pub in Sydney. His phone starts buzzing. It doesn't stop buzzing.  Earlier that night, Palmer and the Dogecoin community had brainstormed a ridiculous (but completely brilliant) idea.  For the first time in a decade, Jamaica's bobsled team had qualified for the Winter Olympics, but it didn't have enough money to attend. As huge fans of the comedy \\\"Cool Runnings [ http://www.metacritic.com/movie/cool-runnings ],\\\" Palmer and the Dogecoin crew decided to do something about it.  They chucked up a Dogecoin address onto the subreddit and asked for donations. Hours later they'd raised $25,000.  That's when Palmer's phone started vibrating off the hook.  \\\"I was like, 'Quick we need to get back to our computers,'\\\" laughs Palmer.  So Palmer and friends stumbled home from the pub, picked up a six-pack of beer for good measure and set about figuring out how to send 26 million Dogecoins to the Jamaican bobsled team.  It was a gesture that symbolized the early spirit of Dogecoin.  In Markus' words, they were allergic to the word \\\"invest.\\\" Both Palmer and Markus donated all their Dogecoin to these massive charity initiatives. They helped build water wells in Kenya and raised money to help train assistance dogs for autistic children.  \\\"We wanted to create something that was a force for good,\\\" explains Palmer.  But as the community grew, the initial spirit in which Dogecoin was launched was difficult to preserve. People started to care about the price of Dogecoin. They were literally and figuratively invested in it.  And that terrified Markus.  \\\"I don't mind if someone spends ten bucks and gets some Dogecoin,\\\" says Markus. \\\"It's like buying a movie ticket or something, that's fun.  \\\"But when someone puts $20,000 in? That makes me really, really uncomfortable.\\\"  Markus began clashing with members of the community. For him, Dogecoin was still crypto \\\"for sillies,\\\" but here it was ballooning into a currency people were trading for real money. In his view Dogecoin was a silly thing that should remain silly. Many in the community disagreed.  Eventually he decided enough was enough.  \\\"I was like, \\\"Okay, this is dumb. I don't want to be the leader of a cult.\\\"\\\"  Markus decided to bail on Dogecoin.  Moolah  It was Moolah that pushed Dogecoin to the brink.  Palmer describes it as \\\"PayPal for cryptocurrency.\\\" From the very beginning, Palmer was cynical.  Run by a British man calling himself Alex Green, Moolah was a cryptocurrency exchange designed to help people buy and sell Dogecoin. They infiltrated the Dogecoin community with startling efficiency.  Alex Green began by doling out Dogecoin in exchange for upvotes on the Dogecoin subreddit. He also donated generously to charitable causes the community were involved in, like $2,500 to a cancer charity, or $3,000 to help get the Dogecoin Nascar vehicle on the track.  The community loved it. Soon Moolah began hiring people from the Dogecoin community for key positions in the company.  \\\"Alex Green started building his business on top of Dogecoin,\\\" says Palmer.  Markus, watching from afar, wasn't a fan.  Despite removing himself from the day-to-day workings of Dogecoin, Markus attended a Dogecoin convention, organized in part by Palmer. He wanted to catch up with some of the old gang. By chance, he ran into representatives from Moolah, who were at the bar guzzling Cristal at $200 a bottle. They poured a glass for Markus.  \\\"I was really uncomfortable,\\\" remembers Markus. \\\"I said, 'whatever's going on here I just don't want any part of it.'\\\"  \\\"I just passed the glass to someone else.\\\"  Many key figures in the Dogecoin community shared Markus' suspicions, particularly Palmer, who was wary of Moolah from the beginning. But when concerns were raised they were mostly shouted down by a community that enjoyed the free currency being sent their way.  Later Moolah began soliciting the Dogecoin community for investment dollars and plenty donated Dogecoin to the cause. Why not? Moolah had been generous in the past. It made sense to repay the favor.  Moolah received over $300,000 from the Dogecoin community, across three separate rounds of investment.  And then it all came crashing down.  Months later, October 2014, Moolah went completely bankrupt. The Dogecoin community would end up losing every single cent they'd invested.  The situation got worse. An ex-girlfriend of Green got in contact with Palmer and other members of the Dogecoin community. She revealed that Green was actually Ryan Kennedy, who was notorious in the UK anime community for running companies terrifyingly similar to Moolah.  Suddenly the UK police were involved. After a three-year investigation, Kennedy faces multiple charges of fraud and money laundering. At a preliminary hearing in Bristol Crown Court  [ https://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/news/bath-news/former-bath-resident-ryan-kennedy-465560 ]on September 2017 he denied all charges. A request for comment was sent to Kennedy's Defence Lawyer, but we've yet to receive a response.  But Kennedy had to answer to more serious, disturbing crimes. In May 2016, he was tried and convicted on three counts of rape with three separate women [ http://blog.cps.gov.uk/2016/05/ryan-kennedy-convicted-of-three-counts-of-rape-against-three-women.html ]. According to press reports he smiled as he was being led from court [ http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3724522/Vicious-sex-fiend-emotionally-controlled-three-women-raped-jailed-11-years.html ].  \\\"Ryan Kennedy convinced his victims they had no choice but to do as they were told,\\\" said senior prosecutor Ben Samples. \\\"He was emotionally, sexually and physically abusive, putting his needs above all else.\\\"  Ryan Kennedy is currently serving an 11-year sentence in a UK prison.  Remember this moment  In the months after Moolah's bankruptcy, Palmer struggled. He distanced himself from Dogecoin. From the community. From cryptocurrency as a whole.  \\\"The energy I was putting into it wasn't helping me from a mental health perspective,\\\" he explains.  The famous Dogecoin. Much cryptocurrency.Dogecoin  Like Markus, Palmer decided to bail on Dogecoin.  Palmer has re-emerged on the cryptocurrency scene. He now runs his own YouTube channel [ https://www.youtube.com/JacksonPalmer ]. He has no interest in launching another cryptocurrency and has little to do with Dogecoin. He calls himself a crypto skeptic. \\\"Cryptocurrency is a solution in search of a problem,\\\" he says.  What problem did Dogecoin solve?  \\\"I don't think it solves anything,\\\" he says. \\\"If anything, it exists as an educational tool. It's a reminder that we can't take this stuff seriously.  \\\"I hope people see Dogecoin and say, I'm not going to put all my money into this. Because right now there's a dog on a coin and it's worth half a billion dollars.\\\"  Outside of the occasional donation, neither Palmer or Markus owns any significant amount of Dogecoin.  Back in January 2014, Markus posted a message on the Dogecoin subreddit; an ode to the community and what it had achieved. One year later, in the wake of the Moolah disaster, it had been reposted. An attempt to recapture the spirit in which Dogecoin had been founded.  It was a timely reminder of what had been lost.  \\\"I have no way of knowing how transient this all may be,\\\" Markus wrote of Dogecoin, two months after creating it.  He wrote about how proud he was -- of the community, of the money they'd raised for various good causes. He thanked everyone for the incredible amount of work they'd put in.  \\\"I would like everyone to remember this moment,\\\" he said. \\\"My hope is that Dogecoin will always be remembered fondly.\\\""}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "Your favorite digital coin is now.

Steps in Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency Dogefather So, what happened between 2014 and 2021? Well, Doge got a father. Shri Shri Elon Musk, who now refers himself as Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency Dogefather. Dogecoin was always loved by Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency internet.

The entire internet janta started talking about it. Remember, they anyway loved it. Other celebs like Snoop Dogg also endorsed Dogecoin and now one Dogecoin is worth $0.5. So, what is Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency problem? The problem is that unlike Bitcoin, there is no regulation on Dogecoin. You will be surprised to know that there are only 21 million Bitcoin in Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency world. This number will not change at any point. On Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency other hand, 15 million Dogecoins are being minted, every day. The crypto enthusiasts call it Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency decentralisation of cryptocurrency. So, by Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency simple demand supply logic, Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency value might start dropping after a point because there will be just too many Dogecoins in Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency world and not enough demand.

If you don't, some of your friends might invest, and then you may regret about passing on Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency opportunity. It's not easy to control yourself in these exciting times, but that's exactly what you need to do. Investing in Dogecoin and other meme currencies is like taking a punt at this point. It's good if you want to experiment and put in some money but, don't go too far with this joke. And, please do not invest your savings into it.

To be clear, I think that's unwise. Cryptocurrency is promising, but please invest with caution.

So, if you want to invest in Dogecoin, do some research, talk to crypto experts and do not just believe every piece of information that is thrown at you. How do I identify meme cryptocurrencies? The first identifier is Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency name. Most of these cryptocurrencies are named after an internet meme or joke. That should be enough for you to stay away from them. For example, Shiba Inu coin or SHIB token is a meme currency of an already existing meme currency. There are many others like MonaCoin, MemeCoin, SafeMoon etc that have become popular on Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency internet but are not as reliable as Bitcoin or Ethereum. Gosh..

Bitcoin is a well-thought cryptocurrency that has lasted for 12 years. Millions of dollars are spent on its ecosystem every year. Dogecoin was a basic copy-paste job. Its source code was literally lifted from another cryptocurrency. And, let me remind you again, it hasn't got a software update in years. People lose their mind when their phone doesn't get a software update. We are talking about currency here. So, infrastructure around a cryptocurrency is Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency second way to identify if it is a meme currency or not. Most of these meme cryptocurrencies don't seem to have a long-term future. After a while, it will be about who sells it first and who is left holding on. Again, that should not stop you from investing. Put in some money, see where it goes but please do not use your life savings.June 22, 2014. Jackson Palmer, a self-identified \\\"average geek,\\\" is high in Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency stands at a Nascar race at Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency Sonoma Raceway in California.

Palmer describes Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency situation using words like \\\"crazy,\\\" \\\"surreal\\\" and \\\"nuts.\\\" He remembers this moment as a \\\"reality check.\\\" Dogecoin was a tweet, then it was a cryptocurrency worth money in Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency real world. Six months later, he watched as a joke that he'd made in passing somehow manifested itself into something tangible. A Dogecar in full flight.The next big thing Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency, a form of digital money that, much like bitcoin, enables peer-to-peer transactions across a decentralized network. One important difference: bitcoin is Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency original blockchain proof-of-concept. Bitcoin is ground-breaking. Bitcoin is (some believe) world-changing tech with Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency potential to transform how money works in Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency 21st century. Dogecoin is a digital coin with a picture of dog on it. \\\"It is a puzzle to me why Dogecoin is so highly valued,\\\" says Adrian Lee, a senior finance lecturer at Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency University of Technology in Sydney. BLOCKCHAIN DECODED Blockchain explained: It builds trust when you need it most What is bitcoin? Here's everything you need to know Bitcoin: Big in investing, but still lousy for buying a sandwich YouTube star wants a cryptocurrency payday for you every day Dogecoin is currently worth $80 billion. It's difficult to make sense of that. \\\"Dogecoin is an easily replicable coin,\\\" Lee said. \\\"I don't know how it distinguishes itself from Bitcoin. I really think it has to do with being established early. \\\"And also Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency dog.\\\" If you've spent any time on Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency internet during Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency last decade, you've probably heard of Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency Doge meme. The iconic Shibe, his inner monologue expressed in comic sans with broken modifiers: \\\"so scare,\\\" \\\"much noble,\\\" \\\"wow.\\\"At Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency peak of Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency meme's popularity near Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency tail end of 2013, Palmer, an Australian marketer for one of Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency world's largest tech companies, made a joke combining two of Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency internet's most talked-about topics: cryptocurrency and Doge. It was a joke taking aim at Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency bizarre world of crypto and bitcoin's multiple derivatives. \\\"Investing in Dogecoin,\\\" Palmer tweeted, \\\"pretty sure it's Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency next big thing.\\\" The tweet got a lot of attention. For laughs, Palmer decided to keep Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency joke going. He bought Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency Dogecoin [ http://Dogecoin.com ] domain and uploaded a photoshopped Shibe on a coin. He left a note on Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency site: If you want to make Dogecoin a reality, get in touch.The bell tolls On Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency other side of Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency world, Billy Markus, a video game-obsessed software engineer at IBM, saw Palmer's note. He'd just finished \\\"Bells\\\", a project he was working on in his spare time. Bells was a cryptocurrency named after money used in Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency Nintendo game Animal Crossing. It was 2013, Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency original crypto gold rush. Markus saw that bitcoin's code was open-source. He decided to take a weekend and do something weird. He tried to create his own cryptocurrency for \\\"sillies,\\\" as he put it. Bells was weird as hell. The major difference between Bells and regular cryptocurrencies was Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency rewards: they were completely random. If you mined bitcoin, using a decently powerful home computer, Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency rewards were consistent. CNET DAILY NEWS Stay in Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency know. Get Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency latest tech stories from CNET News every weekday. If you mined Bells, there was no telling whether Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency reward would be one Bell or 500 Bells. And that's because Bells wasn't meant to be serious, it was a digital currency based on a video game about animals who live in a village and go fishing together. The cryptocurrency community didn't really get Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency joke. \\\"People were just trashing it,\\\" laughs Markus, who quickly discovered there was very little crossover between crypto-obsessives and gamers. \\\"I was like alright, I retire,\\\" says Markus. \\\"I don't need to do this anymore.\\\" But then Markus read Palmer's message on Dogecoin [ http://Dogecoin.com ]. That was Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency moment Billy Markus decided to come out of crypto retirement.Ctrl+F bitcoin When Palmer didn't immediately respond to Markus' offer to help build Dogecoin, he started working on it anyway. \\\"Dogecoin,\\\" says Markus, \\\"from 'that seems like it's funny' to actually doing it, took about three hours. It's almost trivial to create a new cryptocurrency.\\\" It was a find-and-replace job. Ctrl+F 'Bitcoin,' replace with 'Dogecoin.' Markus freely admits to finding large chunks of bitcoin's source code completely incomprehensible, but knew enough to change a few core elements for Dogecoin. For example, Markus created 100 billion dogecoins (as opposed to bitcoin's 21 million) and made them easier to mine. (Dogecoin is already close to being mined out, while bitcoin's final coin will be mined in 2140.) He changed Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency font (to comic sans of course) and changed every mention of Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency word 'mine' to 'dig' (because dogs don't mine, they dig...). And then, during his lunch break, Markus set Dogecoin live. Moving at light speed Premining: Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency act of gathering cryptocurrency before launching your coin into Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency public domain. Almost everyone serious about launching a cryptocurrency does this. But Markus and Palmer didn't premine any Dogecoin. Because they weren't serious about launching a cryptocurrency. \\\"We thought it was this big joke that would die off,\\\" laughs Palmer. And according to Markus, Palmer wasn't even sure how to mine a cryptocurrency. Markus had a relatively powerful gaming PC, with two graphics cards, so he was officially Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency first person to mine Dogecoin. But given Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency nature of mining (which gets increasingly difficult as Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency currency is mined) Billy's computer was no longer powerful enough to mine Dogecoin after about five minutes. Markus split what he'd mined 50-50 with Palmer and that was that. Both got about $5,000 of Dogecoin. And that's all Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency Dogecoin either man would ever own. In online crypto circles, Dogecoin became popular very quickly. Forum threads moved rapidly. The name Dogecoin echoed throughout dark corners of Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency internet. But Reddit was almost certainly Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency main driver in Dogecoin's rapid rise to crypto stardom. The Dogecoin subreddit exploded almost immediately, and with that explosion came Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency infrastructure any cryptocurrency needs if it is to become successful: mining pools, services. \\\"It was moving at light speed,\\\" explains Markus. \\\"Within minutes we were like, 'Wow, this is way out of our control.\\\" But it was Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency Reddit \\\"tipping bot\\\" that drove Dogecoin into Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency stratosphere. If a user posted something to Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency effect of, \\\"hey 'dogebot' tip this person five dogecoin,\\\" that Reddit user would automatically receive five Dogecoin. People were sending Dogecoin back and forth in a feel-good exercise that cost very little money in real-world terms. \\\"I liked it,\\\" says Markus. \\\"At Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency time, Dogecoin wasn't worth anything, but getting five Dogecoin felt better than getting two cents.\\\" Reddit users were sharing Dogecoin back and forth constantly, which expanded Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency user base of Dogecoin and, as a result, increased its value as a cryptocurrency. \\\"Pretty much everyone who used Reddit had Dogecoin,\\\" says Palmer. \\\"I think that was key to its success.\\\" bobsled Enlarge Image The 2014 Jamaican bobsled team, holding Dogecoin t-shirts. Crowdtilt A force for good January 2014. Jackson Palmer is already three drinks deep at a trivia night at his local pub in Sydney. His phone starts buzzing. It doesn't stop buzzing. Earlier that night, Palmer and Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency Dogecoin community had brainstormed a ridiculous (but completely brilliant) idea. For Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency first time in a decade, Jamaica's bobsled team had qualified for Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency Winter Olympics, but it didn't have enough money to attend. As huge fans of Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency comedy \\\"Cool Runnings,\\\" Palmer and Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency Dogecoin crew decided to do something about it. They chucked up a Dogecoin address onto Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency subreddit and asked for donations. Hours later they'd raised $25,000. That's when Palmer's phone started vibrating off Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency hook. \\\"I was like, 'Quick we need to get back to our computers,'\\\" laughs Palmer. So Palmer and friends stumbled home from Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency pub, picked up a six-pack of beer for good measure and set about figuring out how to send 26 million Dogecoins to Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency Jamaican bobsled team. It was a gesture that symbolized Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency early spirit of Dogecoin. In Markus' words, they were allergic to Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency word \\\"invest.\\\" Both Palmer and Markus donated all their Dogecoin to these massive charity initiatives. They helped build water wells in Kenya and raised money to help train assistance dogs for autistic children. \\\"We wanted to create something that was a force for good,\\\" explains Palmer. But as Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency community grew, Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency initial spirit in which Dogecoin was launched was difficult to preserve. People started to care about Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency price of Dogecoin. They were literally and figuratively invested in it. And that terrified Markus. \\\"I don't mind if someone spends ten bucks and gets some Dogecoin,\\\" says Markus. \\\"It's like buying a movie ticket or something, that's fun. \\\"But when someone puts $20,000 in? That makes me really, really uncomfortable.\\\" Markus began clashing with members of Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency community. For him, Dogecoin was still crypto \\\"for sillies,\\\" but here it was ballooning into a currency people were trading for real money. In his view Dogecoin was a silly thing that should remain silly. Many in Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency community disagreed. Eventually he decided enough was enough. \\\"I was like, \\\"Okay, this is dumb. I don't want to be Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency leader of a cult.\\\"\\\" Markus decided to bail on Dogecoin. Moolah It was Moolah that pushed Dogecoin to Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency brink. Palmer describes it as \\\"PayPal for cryptocurrency.\\\" From Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency very beginning, Palmer was cynical. Run by a British man calling himself Alex Green, Moolah was a cryptocurrency exchange designed to help people buy and sell Dogecoin. They infiltrated Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency Dogecoin community with startling efficiency. Alex Green began by doling out Dogecoin in exchange for upvotes on Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency Dogecoin subreddit. He also donated generously to charitable causes Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency community were involved in, like $2,500 to a cancer charity, or $3,000 to help get Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency Dogecoin Nascar vehicle on Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency track. The community loved it. Soon Moolah began hiring people from Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency Dogecoin community for key positions in Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency company. \\\"Alex Green started building his business on top of Dogecoin,\\\" says Palmer. Markus, watching from afar, wasn't a fan.Despite removing himself from Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency day-to-day workings of Dogecoin, Markus attended a Dogecoin convention, organized in part by Palmer. He wanted to catch up with some of Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency old gang. By chance, he ran into representatives from Moolah, who were at Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency bar guzzling Cristal at $200 a bottle. They poured a glass for Markus. \\\"I was really uncomfortable,\\\" remembers Markus. \\\"I said, 'whatever's going on here I just don't want any part of it.'\\\" \\\"I just passed Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency glass to someone else.\\\" Many key figures in Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency Dogecoin community shared Markus' suspicions, particularly Palmer, who was wary of Moolah from Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency beginning. But when concerns were raised they were mostly shouted down by a community that enjoyed Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency free currency being sent their way. Later Moolah began soliciting Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency Dogecoin community for investment dollars and plenty donated Dogecoin to Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency cause. Why not? Moolah had been generous in Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency past. It made sense to repay Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency favor. Moolah received over $300,000 from Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency Dogecoin community, across three separate rounds of investment. And then it all came crashing down. Months later, October 2014, Moolah went completely bankrupt. The Dogecoin community would end up losing every single cent they'd invested. The situation got worse. An ex-girlfriend of Green got in contact with Palmer and other members of Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency Dogecoin community. She revealed that Green was actually Ryan Kennedy, who was notorious in Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency UK anime community for running companies terrifyingly similar to Moolah. Suddenly Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency UK police were involved. After a three-year investigation, Kennedy faces multiple charges of fraud and money laundering. At a preliminary hearing in Bristol Crown Court on September 2017 he denied all charges. A request for comment was sent to Kennedy's Defence Lawyer, but we've yet to receive a response. But Kennedy had to answer to more serious, disturbing crimes. In May 2016, he was tried and convicted on three counts of rape with three separate women. According to press reports he smiled as he was being led from court. \\\"Ryan Kennedy convinced his victims they had no choice but to do as they were told,\\\" said senior prosecutor Ben Samples. \\\"He was emotionally, sexually and physically abusive, putting his needs above all else.\\\" Ryan Kennedy is currently serving an 11-year sentence in a UK prison. Remember this moment In Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency months after Moolah's bankruptcy, Palmer struggled. He distanced himself from Dogecoin. From Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency community. From cryptocurrency as a whole. \\\"The energy I was putting into it wasn't helping me from a mental health perspective,\\\"\\\"I don't think it solves anything,\\\" he says. \\\"If anything, it exists as an educational tool. It's a reminder that we can't take this stuff seriously. \\\"I hope people see Dogecoin and say, I'm not going to put all my money into this. Because right now there's a dog on a coin and it's worth half a billion dollars.\\\" Outside of Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency occasional donation, neither Palmer or Markus owns any significant amount of Dogecoin. Back in January 2014, Markus posted a message on Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency Dogecoin subreddit; an ode to Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency community and what it had achieved. One year later, in Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency wake of Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency Moolah disaster, it had been reposted. An attempt to recapture Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency spirit in which Dogecoin had been founded. It was a timely reminder of what had been lost. \\\"I have no way of knowing how transient this all may be,\\\" Markus wrote of Dogecoin, two months after creating it. He wrote about how proud he was -- of Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency community, of Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency money they'd raised for various good causes. He thanked everyone for Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency incredible amount of work they'd put in. \\\"I would like everyone to remember this moment,\\\" he said. \\\"My hope is that Dogecoin will always be remembered fondly.\\\" New York (CNN Business)Dogecoin is Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency hottest, quirkiest cryptocurrency on Dogecoin go from a joke to a cryptocurrency planet.

DOGE is, without a doubt, my favorite crypto  Why?  Well, I consider myself a crypto purist. Basically that means that, if something doesn't adhere to the basic beliefs outlined in the Bitcoin Whitepaper, then it's not true crypto.  Doge personifies Satoshis vision better than any other; including his/her/their very own bitcoin.  The core belief in the Bitcoin Whitepaper is FREEDOM. Satoshi freed us from the oppression and financial slavery mankind grew into since the first guy handed another guy a lump of salt 10,000 years ago. Here, he said, put this on your food and enjoy it. Then, go over there to Ugg and dig for him in his salt mine and give e two of these back in a month.%3Cparaphrased, of course%3E  Well, that was the beginning of our downfall. To quote Nino Brown from New Jack City, The rich get richer; and the poor don't get a f'kn thing..  The FREEDOM given to us with the release of that Whitepaper is unique, amazing, and has handed life back into the hands of the masses. That FREEDOM has given EVERY human with access to a computer the possibility of achieving incredible success by giving us all control of our own money.  And, THAT is why DOGE is my favorite. The FREEDOM given to us by Satoshi slips from Bitcoin and the other major coins as they rise in value, putting ownership of 1BTC out of reach for most.  Sure, you can own a piece of a Bitcoin, but it's not the same.  To look into my DOGE wallet and see many, many coins is the very embodiment of Satoshi's vison.  DOGE is low in value, and as stable in value as any crypto. What started as a joke has become THE cryptocurrency.  (***Note; I use many forms of crypto. Check out some of my writing on CryptoDetail if you want to learn more about my likes and dislikes. But, DOGE is the king of the hill in my own little cryptosphere.)  Thanks again for asking.

But which one has the better investment in 2021 and beyond?  Dogecoin was originally started as a joke - a satire of the cryptocurrency market and the wild price surges seen by the likes of Bitcoin. It's therefore somewhat ironic that the token has gone on to become one of the most popular cryptos of 2021, boasting a market cap of over $32bn.  It was also perhaps inevitable that eventually, another token would come along to rival Dogecoin - and this is where Shiba Inu comes in. Dubbed the \\u2018Dogecoin killer', Shiba has a similar use case to DOGE, in that it is ostensibly a token for exchange and not really anything more. It also seeks to emulate Dogecoin's success by building a strong community.  According to Shiba Inu founder Ryoshi, it earned the nickname \\\"Dogecoin killer\\\" because the value of SHIB is \\\"primed and ready to overtake the value of Dogecoin.\\\" Ryoshi adds that even if SHIB never hits $0.01, SHIB's publicity and utility mean that it will be worth proportionately more than Dogecoin.  Dogecoin vs Shiba - A Comparison Between Them  Background  Dogecoin was the first of the so-called meme coins, famously started as a joke to satirize the investor hype surrounding the cryptocurrency market.  It seems that Shiba Inu was very much created to mimic the unlikely success of Dogecoin. In its whitepaper, the psuedonymic founder \\u2018Ryoshi' claims that the token is intended to be completely community-driven - much like DOGE had become by that stage.  Transactions and Speed  When it comes to transaction speeds, Dogecoin actually holds up well against many of its contemporaries.  As we have noted, Shiba Inu is built on the Ethereum blockchain so its block creation time and transaction rate are inevitably reflective that of its parent network.  Supply and Demand  Dogecoin is known for its active community and celebrity endorsements, but ultimately the price of an asset is determined by supply and demand.  The developers behind Shiba Inu have taken a different approach when it comes to the token's supply mechanism. SHIB has a circulating supply of 500 trillion and a total cap set at 1 quadrillion.  Dogecoin Vs Shiba: Conclusion  There's no getting away from the fact that both Shiba and Dogecoin are largely built around hype. Whilst both have perfectly workable infrastructures, neither has brought anything particularly new or innovative to the blockchain world when it comes to furthering its capabilities.  However, investors shouldn't be too quick to dismiss the idea of community-led crypto projects. The reality is that most cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value and the fact that Bitcoin still dominates the market despite being launched way back in 2009, shows that technical innovation doesn't always equal success.  On the surface, it might seem obvious that Dogecoin is the stronger investment option, given that Shiba is something of a \\u2018knock off'. However, investors should remember that Shiba has a few technical advantages and the developers behind the project have several expansions planned - including entering into the world of NFTs, which Doge cannot currently match.  Ultimately, anyone planning to invest in either coin will need to keep a close eye on developments within their respective communities. This means keeping abreast of what's going on in Reddit forums, on Twitter and other social media platforms.  Both SHIB and DOGE tokens certainly carry risks, but it is the wild price fluctuations that make meme coins such a tempting opportunity for those who believe they can get in and out at the right times.  Both Shiba and Dogecoin are high-risk investments, so before you invest in any crypto assets, make sure you are willing to take the high level of risk and volatility.  While neither of these crypto assets is considered as a safe investment, Dogecoin may carry less risk than Shiba because it has a longer track record and better name recognition. However, Shiba may have more opportunities for growth over time."}, {"upvote": 17, "content": "Is Shiba Inu Coin the next Dogecoin?"}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/Will-Dogecoin-finally-take-off", "question": "Will Dogecoin finally take off", "answers": [{"upvote": 181, "content": "Dogecoin (DOGE) is a blockchain based decentralized P2P (peer-to-peer) cryptocurrency enabling money transactions in a faster & more secure manner.

With a circulating supply of 129 Billion DOGE at present, a price of $1,000 per unit would give Dogecoin a market cap of 129 TRILLION USD.  All money in circulation on planet earth is thought to be around 37 trillion USD in total, so that means Dogecoin would have 4X the value of all money in circulation on planet earth.  Since all money, including assets in the forms of investments, derivatives, and cryptocurrencies is said to exceed $1.2 quadrillion USD, Dogecoin's marketcap would account for approximately 10% of this total value.

If you found my answer helpful or entertaining, please upvote it. \\ud83d\\ude4f"}, {"upvote": 10, "content": "I think yes. Here are some potential signs of this shift from low-value meme to potential medium of exchange:  1. It is retaining value despite the crypto roller-coaster  That Dogecoin continues to trade far above its early 2021 price range of $0.02 or less suggests that market forces have established a \\\"floor\\\" at current levels, at least for the time being. The coin's worth never fell far below $0.30 during the past month, despite China's push to ban cryptocurrency mining. That decision came as a blow to Bitcoin miners in particular, since 65% of them are believed to operate in China, but the decision exerted downward pressure on the whole crypto market.  2. It has some everyday advantages over Bitcoin  Among the younger demographic that makes up the bulk of cryptocurrency enthusiasts, preserving the environment is commonly seen as a high priority.  In light of that, the vastly lower amount of electricity required to mine and use Dogecoin compared to Bitcoin could boost its attractiveness as a crypto alternative. Dogecoin uses just 0.12 kilowatt-hours of electricity per transaction, compared to Bitcoin's 707 kilowatt-hours.  Though the concept is currently little more than an upbeat prospectus, the nonprofit VeriBlock Foundation says it is working on a \\\"proof-of-proof\\\" blockchain technology that would reuse Bitcoin's proof-of-work security for other cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin. If successfully deployed, the technology could greatly lower Bitcoin's relative environmental costs, while providing improved security for other cryptocurrencies, potentially helping Bitcoin and Dogecoin develop a type of symbiosis rather than a direct rivalry, benefiting holders of both.  While some view with concern the fact that there is no limit on the total number of Dogecoin that could eventually be mined -- in contrast to Bitcoin, which does have a hard cap -- a maximum of 5.26 billion additional Dogecoin tokens can be mined per year. With over 129 billion coins already in circulation, this capped mining rate ensures Dogecoin's inflation rate will decline steadily over time, while still providing an incentive to continue mining it.  The total number of Dogecoin in circulation will rise by 4.1% in 2021, but only 3.9% in 2022. Dogecoin inflation will be 3.5% in 2025, 3.0% by 2030, 2.3% by 2040, and 1.9% by 2048. Given the attrition from lost Dogecoin wallets -- a factor in the supply of all cryptocurrencies -- the coin could theoretically become deflationary at some point if those losses exceed the ever-shrinking inflation provided via mining.  In short, while Dogecoin is theoretically \\\"infinitely inflationary,\\\" its predictably declining, mathematically inevitable inflation rate potentially gives it more a stable value than national currencies.  3. It's gradually winning wider acceptance  Like any currency, Dogecoin gains value as it becomes more widely accepted as a medium of exchange. While dozens of small businesses now accept Dogecoin as a form of payment, their economic impact is effectively zero. However, some larger entities are also accepting Doge, including the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, which will let customers use it to buy both tickets and merchandise through BitPay.  As team owner Mark Cuban stated: \\\"The Mavericks have decided to accept Dogecoin as payment for Mavs tickets and merchandise for one very important, earth shattering reason, because we can!\\\" The team's press release offered some more practical reasons for the decision, noting that the \\\"ability to accept crypto expands a business' sales opportunity into international markets where accepting credit cards is not practical while reducing high fees and increasing payment transparency and efficiency.\\\" The Houston Rockets are also accepting Dogecoin, among other cryptocurrencies.  It is now also possible to purchase the hardest of hard assets, precious metals, using Dogecoin. The largest U.S. silver and gold e-commerce site, JM Bullion, added it to the list of seven cryptocurrencies it accepts as payment. Under JM Bullion's policy, buyers using cryptocurrencies receive a 3% discount on their transactions compared to credit card purchases, close to the 4% discount it offers to purchasers who pay via personal check.  Rumors also continue to swirl that so-called \\\"DogeFather\\\" Elon Musk might start accepting the cryptocurrency for purchases of Tesla vehicles. The electric car manufacturer has stopped accepting Bitcoin payments due to the coin's adverse environmental impact, but Musk continues to offer verbal support for Dogecoin. However, with Musk now signaling that he'd be willing to reverse his Bitcoin rejection if miners commit to \\\"going green,\\\" Tesla's future stance on Dogecoin remains cloudy."}, {"upvote": 58, "content": "The price like anything is determined by supply and demand.  The supply at any given time is a factor of those who are mining DOGE coin mostly with state of the art computers, fast internet connection, and cheap or Free electricity, and those who already own DOGE and decide to sell it.  The demand is determined by those who want to buy DOGE and that is people who have been convinced by tweets from famous people like Elon Musk and Mark Cuban who sometimes do a one word tweet, DOGE and it creates a lot of demand. Other times in an interview Musk might make a comment about how he likes DOGE.  Now think just a bit about those who are buying, (the demand side of the equation) and those who are selling, (the supply side).  The supply has two types of people. Those who own DOGE already because they mined it in the past or bought mostly at a lower price than the current price, and those who are mining DOGE currently. Musk and Cuban, both very rich, have access to big state of the art computers and probably buy electricity cheaper than the average person. The supply of DOGE they have is probably from mining the coin at this advantage over other miners.  Now this is pure speculation on my part, I only suspect that Musk and Cuban mine DOGE. They may not. Or they may do it indirectly through a Hedge fund or other investment vehicle. But of course if they are mining it, Musk and Cuban like DOGE.  The mining reward for each block of transactions is 10,000 DOGE. They are at an advantage if they mine it, for winning the reward since they have the best equipment at their disposal. BTC mining reward is now 6.25 BTC, and even at the start was only 50 BTC.  There is no device in the programing of DOGE coin that halves the mining rate. This is what is unique about BTC and LTC, and DGB, and nearly every legitimate Crypto currency as it is hard wired into their code. It causes there to be dwindling supply over time, and this supply shock tends to drive the price up over time.  But with DOGE, because there is no halving of the mining reward DOGE has no supply shock over time. So the long term prospects for the price is due wholly on the demand that famous people like Musk and Cuban can create by making positive comments about DOGE.  Where BTC and legitimate cryptos rise due to both Dwindling supply, an ultimate hard cap on total supply as well as increasing demand, utilizing both sides of the supply and demand equation, DOGE has no Dwindling supply, No Ultimate hard cap, so there is no limit to the supply side of the equation. And it is unlikely that Musk will be able to continue to increase demand by his comments.  DOGE will eventually have a sustainability crisis.  Eventually all the people who follow Musk and are mentally shallow enough to be convinced to buy DOGE will have already bought it. At that point there will be no one else to buy at a higher price, thus the price will start crashing.  Crashes in price happen with legitimate cryptos like BTC as well but because the fundamentals are much better, (Hard caps, real world use cases, and mining reward halving) for the good cryptos, the prices are higher and more sustainable and as the long term charts show, the good crypto's follow a 4 year cycle because the mining reward supply shock is on a 4 year cycle.  Bottom line is this. Don't be a sucker. Don't buy crypto's that have no use case, were created as a joke, can be created to infinity, have poor fundamentals, and no dwindling supply built in. This is exactly what DOGE is. It's a fools coin.  Yes it might rise in price a while longer. Nearly all crypto's rise when BTC is in a bull market like it is right now. But bull markets don't last forever. Musk and Cuban's credibility on DOGE won't last forever either.  BTW. This is not financial advice.

The faster transaction time and addition of other innovative features might just do the wonder for the coin"}, {"upvote": 128, "content": "Bitcoin's supply is capped at 21 million. But why did Satoshi Nakamoto pick that specific number? There are at least two plausible explanations.  Like many other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC) was designed around the principle of a finite supply. That means there's a fixed upper limit on how many Bitcoin can ever come into existence. In Bitcoin's case, the upper limit was set by its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, at exactly 21 million. For other cryptocurrencies, this cap can vary considerably\\u2014ranging from as low as 18.9 million for Monero (XMR) and Dash to as high as 100 billion for the likes of XRP and Tron (TRX).  The money supply replacement theory  By limiting its maximum supply, and slowing the rate at which new Bitcoin come into existence, Satoshi intended each individual Bitcoin unit (known as a satoshi) to appreciate in value over time.  According to an email purportedly shared between Nakamoto and Bitcoin Core contributor Mike Hearn, Satoshi reasoned that if 21 million coins were to be used by some fraction of the world economy, 0.001 BTC (1 mBTC) could be worth around \\u20ac1. This prediction came true back in 2013, when Bitcoin first broke through the \\u20ac1,000 price point; today, each mBTC is currently worth closer to \\u20ac8.25.  Although Satoshi compares the price of Bitcoin to the Euro in his email, some simple mathematics indicates he may have had a much grander vision for Bitcoin\\u2014better explaining why the 21 million maximum figure was chosen. At the time of Bitcoin's creation, the entire world's money supply stood at approximately $21 trillion. This figure, known as the M1 money supply, is made up of the total value of all the physical money in the world, including cash, coins, travelers' checks, and more. If Bitcoin were to grow to become the single world currency\\u2014replacing all those that the M1 figure is comprised of\\u2014then each BTC would be worth $1 million. Because there are 100 million satoshi in each Bitcoin, this would place the value of each satoshi at $0.01. That fact that these numbers align so closely would be a remarkable coincidence, if it's not intentional.  The alternative explanation  Although the M1 money supply replacement theory is perhaps the most plausible rationale for why Satoshi selected 21 million to be the cap for Bitcoin, there is another\\u2014somewhat simpler\\u2014possible explanation.  Looking at the criteria used to govern the supply of Bitcoin, it becomes obvious that the number of 21 million BTC enables the network to guarantee that blocks are mined in a daily timeframe (10 minutes). It also means that as the maximum supply reaches its limit, the amount of Bitcoin paid out to miners as block rewards decreases over time. As it turns out the Satoshi parameters set for this inevitably lead to a maximum of 21 million BTC being made.  The Bitcoin core code currently adjusts the mining difficulty to ensure that each new block is mined every 10 minutes on average, regardless of how much hash rate is pointed at the network. Based on this feature, a total of 210,000 blocks should be mined in each four-year cycle, after which the block reward is halved. The first cycle saw 50 BTC minted per block; this was halved to 25 BTC/block in 2012, then again to 12.5 BTC/block in 2016. Following 2020's halving, it currently sits at 6.25/BTC block.  If you extrapolate this forward, you will find that the sum of the block rewards for each cycle equals 100 (50 + 25 + 6.25 +3.125, etc). By multiplying this number by the 210,000 blocks/cycle figure, you arrive at the maximum possible supply of 21 million.  So, is Bitcoin's supply cap a philosophical gesture, or the product of remorseless mathematical logic?

These days, there are a lot of legitimate offers online that gives great advantage to cryptocurrency investors where they get good returns of their invested cryptocurrency on platforms like CryptoFXnetwork Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www . cryptofxnetwork . com). These are opportunities that need to be really utilized to its maximum.

Steph Brooks, CFA, is a registered investment advisor on a mission to bring simplicity to the world of investing.  1. Dogecoin is a Meme. That gives it power.  Memes are ideas, they are decentralized inside-jokes. Their hive mind virality spreads like wildfire in the cultural zeitgeist. Like a virus, memes mutate and adapt, blending with other memes to appropriate trends. Their parabolic growth is expedited due to the inter-connectedness of our social media world.  Like the GameStop phenomenon, Dogecoin is fueled by memes, fervor, and a decentralized community of retail investors. The GameStop short squeeze was propelled by viral memes in the WallStreetBets Reddit community. Memes like we like the stock! and diamond hands lit a fire under the movement, with jokes about tendies, stonks, and degenerate trading fueling the blaze. Doge is a meme, and as we've seen, memes take on a life of their own. They are not to be underestimated.  Words like much, wow, and many are popular in Doge memes like this one.  Most memes usually peak and die out, but some stick around. And here's the thing with Doge: it's Lindy. It's been around for an unusually long time. That gives it a higher probability of surviving even longer.  As the meme expands and its utility as a cryptocurrency is actualized, Dogecoin will grow in popularity and value. Although currently floating around four cents, it could eventually reach a dollar. Dogecoin to a dollar has become a part of the meme. #DogecoinToADollar, which has recently been trending on twitter, may be a prophesy of what's to come.  2. Dogecoin has strong and unique branding  Branding is important. It influences our purchasing decisions and our sentiment towards products, services, and ideas. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies, so branding matters for public adoption. Bitcoin is at the forefront of the cryptocurrency revolution because of its strong and unique branding.  For Bitcoin to act as its intended purpose as the reserve currency of the world, it cannot be beholden to any state, country, or individual. Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, fortified the integrity of the Bitcoin system by remaining anonymous and never cashing out his early coffers. This, along with its originality and resilience, gives Bitcoin a strong brand foundation.  Similar to Bitcoin, Dogecoin also has strong and unique branding. Dogecoin is symbolized by the Shiba Inu dog meme. Its logo is a cute dog. Other cryptocurrencies don't have a logo as memorable or funny. It's ironic for something so silly like a dog-meme to be associated with such a serious financial asset. It makes a mockery of traditional cryptocurrency networks. Plus, who doesn't love dogs?  Dogecoin's logo is symbolized by its official mascot, a Shiba Inu dog  Propelling the Dogecoin zeal is Elon Musk, who regularly tweets about the coin and previously touted himself as the former CEO of Dogecoin. Decentralized ideas are often helmed by an unofficial but bonafide leader. Satoshi Nakamoto for Bitcoin, u/DeepFuckingValue for GameStop, and now Elon Musk for Dogecoin.  With influential individuals like Elon Musk leading the Dogecoin choir, the cryptocurrency stands to gain from its growing brand popularity as hoards of young people share #DogecoinArmy, #DogecoinToTheMoon, and #DogeToADollar, spreading the meme mania on Reddit, TikTok, and Twitter.  Elon Musk shared this Doge meme on January 28th, 2021 on his Twitter, causing Dogecoin to surge 300%  3. Dogecoin is an anti-establishment movement. This fuels growth.  The GameStop short squeeze has shown us that people are fed up with the financial establishment.

For example, Bitcoin has a market cap of over $10 billion, while Dogecoin has a market cap of only $250 million. This means that there is room for substantial price appreciation if demand for Dogecoin increases.  * Second, the development team behind Dogecoin is very active and continues to build new features and products that make the cryptocurrency more user friendly and accessible. For example, in late 2017 the team released Dogethereum, a bridge between the Ethereum and Dogecoin blockchains that allows for seamless transfers of Dogecoin tokens. The team is also working on http://Dogethereum.io, which is a decentralized crowdfunding platform that allows for the creation of new startups based on the Dogecoin blockchain and peer-to-peer smart contracts.  * Third, it's possible that some of the other cryptocurrencies will become less popular over time. If this happens, then investors may move their funds over to Dogecoin as a more attractive investment option. In general, the cryptocurrency market is still in its early stages, so it's possible that there will be many volatile price swings in the future. For these reasons, it makes sense for investors to keep an eye on this emerging digital asset and consider adding it to their portfolios.  * Fourth, Dogecoin has a very passionate and active community. This is evident from the many social media posts, memes, and other content that is created on a daily basis. The supportive community provides a level of stability and confidence that can help to drive up prices.  * Finally, it's worth noting that Dogecoin is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies on Robinhood, a commission-free stock trading platform. This means that there is significant interest from individual investors, which could lead to further price appreciation. Overall, there are a number of reasons why Dogecoin could reach one dollar in the future. However, it's important to remember that cryptocurrencies are very volatile and subject to price fluctuations due to a wide range of factors.

So it is Bitcoin for him, Douchecoin for the plebs.  He has adopted Douchecoin as a pet project, mostly to mess with people. During an interview, he glibly stated that the most ironic coin will prevail. During his Time: Man of the Year interview, he said that Bitcoin is a good store of value, like digital gold, but it isn't feasible for small and daily transactions due to cost and speed. This would be true, but for the fact that there is a workaround which is designed to solve these problems. [1] Bitcoin is not as bad for the environment as claimed. Not by far.  And he is fully aware of it but left it out. The Lightining Network enables Bitcoin to be sent instantly in large volumes, faster than the Visa network. [2] It is also extremely inexpensive to use. The Lightining Network already has an app, called muun, which is available for Android and iOS. [3] It is dead simple to use.  Musk regularly messes with retail investors using Twitter. He has been fined by the SEC for making illegal statements which moved markets. [4] Power has gone to his head. He isn't the same person he used to be.  Is Bitcoin harmful to the environment?   %3E The value of Bitcoin's electricity use  Bitcoin total operating costs do not differ much from those of intermediated payment networks such as Mastercard and Visa. Yet these card networks facilitate many more transactions than Bitcoin: Digiconomist reports [ https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption ] that Bitcoin uses 550,000 times as much electricity per transaction as Visa.  However, the number of transactions is a poor standard for judging the value exchanged on competing networks. Mastercard and Visa handle large numbers of small\\u2010\\u200bdollar exchanges, whereas the Bitcoin transactions are $16,000 on average [ https://www.blockchain.com/charts/n-transactions ]. The slow speed of the Bitcoin network and the large fluctuations [ https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/02/bitcoins-transaction-fee-crisis-is-over-for-now/ ] in average transaction fees make low\\u2010\\u200bvalue exchanges unattractive. Moreover, unlike card networks, cryptocurrencies are still not generally accepted and therefore used more as a store of value than a medium of exchange.  With that in mind, if we compare Bitcoin and the card networks by the volume of transactions processed, a different picture emerges. The volume of Bitcoin transactions [ https://coinmarketcap.com/ ] over the 24 hours to August 27 was $3.6 billion, which is not an outlier. That yields annual transaction volume of $1.33 trillion. This is below Mastercard's approximate $6 trillion and Visa's $7.8 trillion in payments volume over 2017. But it is not orders of magnitude below.  In fact, as ARK Invest reported over the weekend, Bitcoin has already surpassed the smaller card network Discover, and online payments pioneer Paypal, in online transactions volume. Overtaking the most successful payment network of the internet era is quite a milestone.  [empty\\u2010\\u200bpara] [ https://cdn.alt-m.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Bitcoin_Electricity_Image1.png ]Source: ARK Invest newsletter, Aug. 26  Long\\u2010\\u200bterm prospects for the Bitcoin network  As mentioned above, comparisons between Bitcoin and intermediated payment networks must be conducted with caution, because most transactions on Mastercard, Paypal and Visa are for the exchange of goods and services, whereas much of the dollar value of Bitcoin transactions has to do with speculative investment in the cryptocurrency and the mining of new bitcoins. Only a fraction of Bitcoin payments involve goods and services.  However, that people are eager to get a hold of bitcoins today shows that some firmly believe Bitcoin has the potential to become more widely demanded.  The prospects for Bitcoin as an investment, on the other hand, are perhaps more questionable than its proponents assume. After all, the value of a medium of exchange is given by the equation MV = PQ, where M is the money supply, V the velocity at which money units change hands, P the price level and Q the real volume of transactions.  Bitcoin bulls posit, quite plausibly, that Q will only grow in coming years. But unless Bitcoin becomes a store\\u2010\\u200bof\\u2010\\u200bvalue cryptocurrency that is not frequently exchanged, V will also grow as Bitcoin users transact more on the network. This will push up the price level P and depress the value of individual bitcoins. Thus, Bitcoin's very success as a medium of exchange may doom it as an investment [ https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/10/17/moe.html ].  But that is orthogonal to the policy discussion as to whether Bitcoin's admittedly large power requirements are a matter of concern. Whereas competing payment systems rely on a many inputs, from physical buildings to a skilled workforce to reputational and financial capital, Bitcoin's primary input is electricity. What Bitcoin illustrates is that achieving successful governance without the role of an intermediary is costly \\u2013 costly enough that Bitcoin may struggle to outcompete payment intermediaries.  On the other hand, there are efforts afoot to introduce innovations into the Bitcoin network to increase its energy efficiency. The Lightning Network [ https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf ] project, which seeks to enable transactions to happen outside the Bitcoin blockchain over the course of (for example) a trading day, and to record only the starting and closing balance, is such an initiative. Other, more controversial ideas are to rapidly increase the maximum size of a transaction block, which would speed up transaction processing but might not make much of a dent in power usage. Others have addressed the issue more directly, by building renewable generation capacity [ https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611908/this-company-thinks-it-can-help-solve-bitcoins-energy-problem/ ] specifically aimed at cryptocurrency mining.  Is Bitcoin's electricity use socially wasteful?  Behind claims like Carstens' that Bitcoin is an environmental disaster lies the veiled accusation that the cryptocurrency's electricity use is somehow less legitimate, or socially less valuable, than electricity use by schools, hospitals, households and offices. Is there any truth to this claim?  Economists have known since at least Pigou [ http://files.libertyfund.org/files/1410/Pigou_0316.pdf ] that the only way to determine wastefulness in resource use is by examining whether an activity has unpriced externalities which might lead agents to over\\u2010 or underuse the resource. In those instances, these social costs must be incorporated into the price of the resource to motivate efficient production.  What this means for Bitcoin is that the cryptocurrency itself cannot be socially wasteful. The environmental impact of electricity use is unconcerned with the purpose of that use. Whether electric power is consumed for the mining of cryptocurrency or the production of cars has no bearing on the environmental effects. Therefore, the impact of Bitcoin depends on two factors over which the network has no control: the way in which power is generated and how electricity is priced.  Both vary widely across jurisdictions. Iceland, which due to its comparably low power costs [ https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Electricity_price_statistics ] and still lower temperatures is a favorite location for Bitcoin miners, generates nearly all of its electricity from renewable geothermal sources, which also emit much lower amounts of carbon than coal\\u2010 or gas\\u2010\\u200bfired plants. Iceland participates in the European Union's emissions trading system, which despite its imperfect design does a good job of internalizing the social cost of power generation.  Canada, like Iceland a cold jurisdiction, uses hydroelectric power to generate 59 percent [ https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/facts/electricity/20068 ] of its electricity. In the crypto\\u2010\\u200bfavorite province of Quebec, 95 percent of power is hydroelectric, and prices are particularly low. While the overall environmental impact of hydropower is contested, there is agreement [ https://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/our-energy-choices/renewable-energy/environmental-impacts-hydroelectric-power.html#.W4VqC85KiUk ] that its carbon footprint is a fraction of those of gas\\u2010 and coal\\u2010\\u200bfired plants. Canada has also recently implemented a nationwide cap\\u2010\\u200band\\u2010\\u200btrade scheme [ https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/climate-action/pricing-carbon-pollution/output-based-pricing-system.html ] in a bid to price carbon emissions.  China, the largest jurisdiction for mining, offers a less encouraging picture, as it still generates close to half its electricity from coal. However, this is drastically down from 72 percent in 2015 and has dropped even in absolute terms. The People's Republic's attempts to reduce its carbon footprint per unit of GDP have relied more on command\\u2010\\u200band\\u2010\\u200bcontrol shifts from coal to other sources than on market forces.  Whichever way one looks at it, however, the environmental impact of Bitcoin and other electricity\\u2010\\u200bintensive cryptocurrencies is a function not of their software architecture, but of the energy policies in the countries where miners operate.  Much ado about nothing  We can only conclude that reports of cryptocurrencies' wreaking environmental havoc have been greatly exaggerated. An examination of transaction volumes shows that Bitcoin's power use is not outside the league of intermediated payments systems. Moreover, it will be in the interest of Bitcoin miners to reduce the per\\u2010\\u200btransaction electricity cost of mining, as otherwise the network will struggle to grow and compete with incumbents. Finally, there is no evidence that cryptocurrencies have environmental externalities beyond those that can be ascribed to any electricity user wherever electricity is inefficiently priced. But public policy, not cryptocurrency innovation, is at fault there. [5]  1. Lightning Network [ https://lightning.network/ ] 2. Lightning Network [ https://lightning.network/ ] 3.

So people started creating their own crypto's so that they can filter out the mistakes with bitcoin. These coins are called Altcoins, in fact, Dogecoin is also an altcoin.  Purpose  The purpose of dogecoin was not to scam people but to make it absolutely fun. They just wanted to make a meme coin, which they did!  Making it viral  Dogecoin became popular when people started tipping (Reddit) creators through Dogecoin. Ideally, Dogecoin isn't very valuable or expensive but just for efforts, people started to tip creators through Dogecoin. After this, Dogecoin just blew up on Reddit and people started to know more about it.  People like Elon Musk and Mark Cuban never leave any opportunity to promote Dogecoin. Just as to promote the use of dogecoin, the NBA team Dallas Mavericks offered special adjustments for those who pay with dogecoin. In addition to that Elon Musk has made so many tweets indirectly promoting doge, which leads to making doge a viral thing.

Dogecoin stepped into the crypto industry at the end of 2013. Most crypto experts were unsure about the success of Dogecoin as a crypto contender due to the rising popularity of Bitcoin. Anyway, all predictions and forecasts related to Dogecoin's demand turned into jokes as time flew. At present, Dogecoin has a strong ground as a cryptocurrency in the world of cryptos. The value of Dogecoin is supposed to escalate astonishingly over time.  If you're new to the world of cryptos, you might be confused about which crypto to invest in. At present, every crypto enthusiast has a question- is Dogecoin superior to Bitcoin or not? Let's find out the answer to this question.  A brief introduction to Dogecoin  Dogecoin is just another cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Litecoin. According to experts, the purpose behind launching Dogecoin was to humiliate Bitcoin. Dogecoin used to be referred to as a joke cryptocurrency as the concept behind Dogecoin wasn't as complex as Bitcoin.  Astonishingly, the simplicity of the Dogecoin transactions seemed to rule crypto users' hearts. At present, the market cap value of Dogecoin is 54 Billion USD. Isn't the amount jaw-dropping? Well, still most people question the supremacy of Dogecoin.  Truth to be spoken, Dogecoin is a better option to invest in than Bitcoin or any other crypto. Why? Let's jump into the next phase of the article to explore that.  Why Dogecoin is a better option than Bitcoin?  Dogecoin beats Bitcoin in multiple parameters. Can you imagine that crypto came out while heavyweight cryptos like Bitcoin and Litecoin were already there, and secured a higher place? Well, it's hard to believe, but it's the fact. The following point will enlighten you on Dogecoin's supremacy over Bitcoin.  Minimum transaction fees  Transaction fees of bitcoin have been a major drawback of this crypto since its initial days. Unfortunately, the fees got escalated over the years, and it's around 15 USD per transaction currently. Eventually, the transaction fees hike up to 60 USD per transaction if you choose busy hours to make transactions.  On the contrary, Dogecoin transactions merely go up to 1 USD per transaction. So, why won't crypto users lean forward to Dogecoin? Reasonable transaction fees are the highlights of Dogecoin and that's going to be an advantage in the long run.  Transactions are possible within a blink of eyes  Dogecoin is approximately 10 times faster than Bitcoin in terms of transactions. The average time of Bitcoin blocks is 10 mins which may take up to hours during higher transaction flow. A Dogecoin block, on the other side, can be solved within a minute. Now, do your math and figure out which one is profitable!  Lesser number of lost coins  20% of mined Bitcoins are already inaccessible and lost due to technical issues and the percentage will keep escalating throughout the next two decades. What are the end results of Bitcoin then? Isn't it worrisome? Dogecoin ensures adding 5 billion coins to the blockchain network yearly. Now, doesn't it seem like Dogecoin is a securer option to invest in? No matter if you're a miner, or a general user, it's normal to be skeptical about Bitcoin's future. No need to specify that the secure future of Dogecoin helped it get market acceptance and preference over Bitcoin.  Greater stability  Dogecoin eliminated the concept of drastic price fluctuation in terms of cryptos. Already 130 billion outstanding Dogecoins exist in the Dogecoin network. Moreover, 5 billion coins get added to the Dogecoin blockchain yearly, without failure. Tesla can't compete with this gigantic resource with its 1 billion outstanding shares. Being powered by a stable company like Apple, Dogecoin is more likely to grow and flourish instead of getting extinct from the world of cryptos. Naturally, no blockchain user would like to gamble by investing in Bitcoin while Dogecoin is there.  Increased profit margin  Bitcoin mining is not at all profitable from a miner's point of view. The rewards of bitcoin mining are not fair enough according to the effort required for mining bitcoins. Who would like to receive marginal rewards after hours of hard work? Also, the graph or bitcoin mining rewards tend to downwards. Moreover, the Bitcoin network won't keep on offering rewards once the network contains a total of 21 million Bitcoins. So, where's the point in spending effort on mining such crypto?  Alongside being stable, 5 billion coins will keep getting added to the Dogecoin network every year. So, the possible profit margins of the network will remain the same. Rather it might increase over the years.  Final words  As you see, Dogecoin beats Bitcoin in almost every aspect. Be it profit margins or convenience, Dogecoin is a better choice than any other crypto. Factually, Dogecoin can be considered as the future of cryptos. So, we suggest you opt for Dogecoin instead of wasting your time and effort in mining Bitcoin."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "Since you used the word invest, you should definitely go for Bitcoin which has by far the best investment case in the crypto space:   * High potential to become a store of value against declining fiat (USD, EUR, CNY, etc)  * Largest network and liquidity  * Potential Short-, mid-term triggers like a Bitcoin ETF and the next Bitcoin halving in 2020 An investment in Dogecoin is much more speculative."}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "This question is not really legit because you are compare two different things.

DOGE Has A Good Future Growth Dogecoin has climbed to the 24th position on CoinMarketCap, with a total market capitalization of $279 million.  While this may seem like a lot, but a sudden spike in popularity could really lead this cryptocurrency ahead in future.

Whenever Elon Musk or any other celebrity tweets about Dogecoin, we often see a huge jump in price."}, {"upvote": 3, "content": "Let's look at the price graph for the last three month:  The currency was worth $0.008 back in January of 2021 and then it gained to about $0.07 in a very short time. That is basically an 8x gain in value. In April the price went to about $0.30 which is another 5x gain in value. Overall the price of Dogecoin went about 37x from its average in January.  The traditional investing pattern would suggest this is some sort of pump and dump if this was a price movement of a penny stock. In the case of Dogecoin, we know what happened. Elon Musk basically made some meme-related posts about it and it propelled the currency up with many day traders buying it with a belief that they will be able to get out in time if it drops. In that sense, this was a classic pump but this is not a nefarious illegal sort of pump and dump because Elon as far as we know it did not make a big investment in the currency only to dump it for a profit which would be illegal.  The fact that Dogecoin has maintained the $0.3 level value for six days now is already pretty incredible in its own right. The people who day traded it for a quick sensible profit have probably long exited their position by now. So the question should be as to who is buying and selling right now?  Who is buying?  1. People who feel the currency is fairly priced if Elon Musk continues to support it. These folks feel Elon Musk has some sort of plan that he has not announced yet. Perhaps he is waiting for some technical indicator before he makes his next move. He has the power to convince the board of Tesla to allow acceptance of Dogecoin as payment to purchase cars which would be a huge benefit to the currency. The marketing of the currency gives it a value of its own. 2. People who feel the currency may have some staying power. Perhaps it can maintain its status of major cryptocurrency if the meme nature of it continues or some more celebrities join in on the joke or simply that many more people start using it for everyday things. Perhaps the incredible rise will encourage the community to continue to advance the currency on technical levels. Who is selling?  1. People who don't agree with the people who are buying. They don't think the currency has any staying power and they think this is a dilutional fantasy that it could somehow get to $1 if enough people make meme posts about it. 2. Most importantly the people who are long-term holders of a lot of the currency that was mined early on. These are the so-called whales. These folks have come into incredible wealth basically by luck. It is like a thousand people all of a sudden won the jackpot in the lottery on the same day. Do you think a lot of them won't be heading to the cash register? Let's say someone had a million Dogecoins in their wallet and they pretty much forgot about it for years. Now, this is worth like $1M all of a sudden. I think anyone rational would be crazy to not at least cash in half to pay off a mortgage or student loans and secure their financial independence. The super whales who have so much dogecoin they have become wealthy beyond most people's imagination should at least know if they try to sell it all at once on public exchange it would crash the price so perhaps they are not so selfish as to do that. By the way, the point about whales selling now is actually a great thing for cryptocurrency's health. This may suck for anyone who FOMOed into buying it at $0.42 as they are down about 20% right now but it is a great thing for Dogecoin as a whole. Elon Musk hinted that he liked to see whales divest of some of their holdings in Dogecoin in order for him to seriously back it. Maybe some of them are doing that right now and simply following his advice. If that is the case there can be some long-term upside to Dogecoin. It matters that asset like cryptocurrency is widely owned and used in order to it to maintain it's value.  Also, I like to note that the mainstream media is busy writing all sorts of Dogecoin is in a bubble and warning newbie investors how careful they should be. I get what they are doing but writing over-the-top headlines is a bit too much. Every new investor should know that buying Dogecoin at these historically high prices is very risky and there is a good chance of downside in the short term but there are some chances of an upside as well so buying it is not totally irrational.  Disclaimer. Personally, I have a positive bias towards Dogecoin because of simply human phycology. I happen to have mined a little bit of it in 2014 as an experiment without having any hope of it gaining much value in the future. I was pleasantly surprised by its rise in price making me an accidental Dogecoin winner. I feel sort of like I won the lottery but got the lower value lottery ticker with fewer numbers guessed. Like the guy who won $100K in a lottery, enough to be happy but not enough to be like I am going to quit my day job happy."}, {"upvote": 894, "content": "It is June 22, 2014.

This means they can create as many new Dogecoins as they wish. This causes inflation and devalues the currency.  (Example. Bitcoin's MAX supply is 21 Million, and the incoming supply gets smaller over time which drives the price higher)  -----------------  3. Dogecoin's current market cap is $6,762,518,591  (the overall total amount of money invested into the market)  -----------------  4. In order for Dogecoin to reach a price of $1  an additional $121,387,643,225 would have to be invested into Dogecoin. Nearly 18x as much as what is invested into it now.  -----------------  5. What drives the price of Dogecoin is hype. Period. The Community, Influencers like Elon Musk and others make posts on social media and if it trends the price increases because beginner investors buy into the hype.  -----------------  Smart hands sell their portion when the price increases like this to uneducated investors and make money, the hype dies off and the price corrects back to a fair value price. You lose money on your investment.  These are known as \\\"pump and dump\\\" coins.

In few years from now you'd be glad you did!

It enables beginners to become acquainted with the cryptocurrency market and gain valuable experience.  * Dogecoin allows for quick and inexpensive transactions.  * In terms of market capitalization, Dogecoin is among the top ten cryptocurrencies, indicating its high stability and trustworthiness.  * Unlike most other cryptocurrencies, there are no scaling issues.  * DOGE's transaction speed is extremely fast, and its commission rates are extremely low.  * Dogecoin is supported by a number of exchanges and online platforms. Another significant benefit of Dogecoin is its high degree of stability. Decentralized systems are unquestionably more secure than their centralized counterparts, since the lack of a governing server guarantees a higher level of security. Sooner or later, blockchain will be widely acknowledged as the most secure technology available today. Most cryptocurrencies have certain centralized features, and Dogecoin is one of the few networks that implements decentralization.  Another feature that sets Dogecoin apart from conventional payment and financial transfers is that, unlike in the banking industry, transactions are solely controlled by the consumer. As a result, no transaction can be canceled for reasons beyond the control of the customer.  It makes no difference to whom or where funds are transferred or what goods are purchased; the transaction will be completed regardless.

With all of this in mind, it's safe to say that Dogecoin has a good chance of hitting $1.00 within the next four years. sometime last year DogeCoin was at $0.30 and dropped to $0.12 as of this year 2022 and it's clear that many people still don't really understand what this currency is all about.

Here are some potential signs of this shift from low-value meme to potential medium of exchange:  1. It is retaining value despite the crypto roller-coaster  That Dogecoin continues to trade far above its early 2021 price range of $0.02 or less suggests that market forces have established a \\\"floor\\\" at current levels, at least for the time being. The coin's worth never fell far below $0.30 during the past month, despite China's push to ban cryptocurrency mining. That decision came as a blow to Bitcoin miners in particular, since 65% of them are believed to operate in China, but the decision exerted downward pressure on the whole crypto market.  2. It has some everyday advantages over Bitcoin  Among the younger demographic that makes up the bulk of cryptocurrency enthusiasts, preserving the environment is commonly seen as a high priority.  In light of that, the vastly lower amount of electricity required to mine and use Dogecoin compared to Bitcoin could boost its attractiveness as a crypto alternative. Dogecoin uses just 0.12 kilowatt-hours of electricity per transaction, compared to Bitcoin's 707 kilowatt-hours.  Though the concept is currently little more than an upbeat prospectus, the nonprofit VeriBlock Foundation says it is working on a \\\"proof-of-proof\\\" blockchain technology that would reuse Bitcoin's proof-of-work security for other cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin. If successfully deployed, the technology could greatly lower Bitcoin's relative environmental costs, while providing improved security for other cryptocurrencies, potentially helping Bitcoin and Dogecoin develop a type of symbiosis rather than a direct rivalry, benefiting holders of both.  While some view with concern the fact that there is no limit on the total number of Dogecoin that could eventually be mined -- in contrast to Bitcoin, which does have a hard cap -- a maximum of 5.26 billion additional Dogecoin tokens can be mined per year. With over 129 billion coins already in circulation, this capped mining rate ensures Dogecoin's inflation rate will decline steadily over time, while still providing an incentive to continue mining it.  The total number of Dogecoin in circulation will rise by 4.1% in 2021, but only 3.9% in 2022. Dogecoin inflation will be 3.5% in 2025, 3.0% by 2030, 2.3% by 2040, and 1.9% by 2048. Given the attrition from lost Dogecoin wallets -- a factor in the supply of all cryptocurrencies -- the coin could theoretically become deflationary at some point if those losses exceed the ever-shrinking inflation provided via mining.  In short, while Dogecoin is theoretically \\\"infinitely inflationary,\\\" its predictably declining, mathematically inevitable inflation rate potentially gives it more a stable value than national currencies.  3. It's gradually winning wider acceptance  Like any currency, Dogecoin gains value as it becomes more widely accepted as a medium of exchange. While dozens of small businesses now accept Dogecoin as a form of payment, their economic impact is effectively zero. However, some larger entities are also accepting Doge, including the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, which will let customers use it to buy both tickets and merchandise through BitPay.  As team owner Mark Cuban stated: \\\"The Mavericks have decided to accept Dogecoin as payment for Mavs tickets and merchandise for one very important, earth shattering reason, because we can!\\\" The team's press release offered some more practical reasons for the decision, noting that the \\\"ability to accept crypto expands a business' sales opportunity into international markets where accepting credit cards is not practical while reducing high fees and increasing payment transparency and efficiency.\\\" The Houston Rockets are also accepting Dogecoin, among other cryptocurrencies.  It is now also possible to purchase the hardest of hard assets, precious metals, using Dogecoin. The largest U.S. silver and gold e-commerce site, JM Bullion, added it to the list of seven cryptocurrencies it accepts as payment. Under JM Bullion's policy, buyers using cryptocurrencies receive a 3% discount on their transactions compared to credit card purchases, close to the 4% discount it offers to purchasers who pay via personal check.  Rumors also continue to swirl that so-called \\\"DogeFather\\\" Elon Musk might start accepting the cryptocurrency for purchases of Tesla vehicles. The electric car manufacturer has stopped accepting Bitcoin payments due to the coin's adverse environmental impact, but Musk continues to offer verbal support for Dogecoin. However, with Musk now signaling that he'd be willing to reverse his Bitcoin rejection if miners commit to \\\"going green,\\\" Tesla's future stance on Dogecoin remains cloudy."}, {"upvote": 9, "content": "Crypto prices are highly volatile, it's hard to tell when the crypto bubble will burst.

Dogecoin is a peer to peer, decentralized and digital currency that allows you to send money online easily. Dogecoin was initiated as a joke, but who knew it would become so significant in the crypto world. The Doge cryptocurrency is even used by retailers to accept payments. Its logo is a dog, that's their friendly mascot which also makes them so much more likable among the social media crowd. It is a Shiba Inu, a Japanese breed of dog that shot to fame as an internet meme and represents the Doge crypto.  Dogecoin is a high value buy for 2020 as predicted by experts. But recently it is going through turmoil as there is a lack of Dogethereum (a bridge between dogecoin and ether chains), the project which has a lot of potentials to grow. Dogecoin aims to become the default crypto for merchant payments in this year itself, which will eventually lead to greater gains. After the live demo of Dogethereum, the adoption rate of DOGE has increased.  Dogecoin Price Prediction 2020  Dogecoin might hover around the $0.02 mark, where the maximum expected price might be $0.0284 and the minimum expected price will be $0.0214.  It is likely to reach the $0.03 mark by the end of this year, as this is the year of the cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin is likely to pick up from late 2019 as people are realizing it's worth and they are getting over it being a mere crypto joke.  Dogecoin Price Prediction 2025  In a 5-year time frame, Dogecoin is likely to reach $0.04 mark. It might reach $0.05 also if it doesn't come across any turbulence. Dogecoin price prediction suggests that the Dogecoin price is up for a long-term gain in the DOGE price value with a 5-year investment. This means that in 2025, the Dogecoin price is forecasted to stand at around $ 0.044.

But the main reason the genius behind BTC created it, was a response to the ridiculous way the 2008 financial crisis was totally (blanking) over the average hard working people of our country, allowing banks to foreclose on peoples homes while they were living in them, not able to pay a couple of payments due to being laid off work, and on the top end of the financial spectrum, bailing out huge Billionaire corporations because they were too big to fail  BTC was a peaceful protest against the debasement of currencies, and fascism in our country I might add.

FAQ on mobile cryptocurrency mining on smartphones, updated for 2021 Q. Can I mine cryptocurrency on my smartphone? A. Ignoring mine Dogecoin in your mobile fact that mining cryptocurrencies requires a huge amount of processing power, Google and Apple don't allow on-device mining on Android and iOS hardware. The ban, originally introduced in 2018 is still applicable. Google's latest Developer Program Policy (effective January 20, 2021) clearly states: We don't allow apps that mine cryptocurrency on devices. We permit apps that remotely manage mine Dogecoin in your mobile mining of cryptocurrency. Q. Why did Google ban crypto mining apps? A. Mining crypto puts mine Dogecoin in your mobile processor and other components in mine Dogecoin in your mobile device under extreme stress, and also drains mine Dogecoin in your mobile battery. The Apple Store guidelines state that Apps should not rapidly drain battery, generate excessive heat, or put unnecessary strain on device resources. While Google hasn't specified mine Dogecoin in your mobile reasons for delisting mine Dogecoin in your mobile crypto mining apps, we can assume they did so because of mine Dogecoin in your mobile same reasons, that is, to prevent mine Dogecoin in your mobile devices from overheating and damaging mine Dogecoin in your mobile hardware. Q. But I still see some mining apps listed in mine Dogecoin in your mobile Play Store. What gives? A. As noted in mine Dogecoin in your mobile policy listed above, Google allows apps that help you manage cryptocurrency mining that's being done remotely, either in mine Dogecoin in your mobile cloud, or on your computer. Apps such as MinerGate Control do not really mine cryptocurrency on your smartphone. Instead, they enable you to keep track of mine Dogecoin in your mobile mining operation that's being done remotely, and perhaps even cash out any crypto that's been mined on your behalf in mine Dogecoin in your mobile cloud. Q. So is there no way I can make cryptocurrencies using my phone? A. Virtually all mine Dogecoin in your mobile crypto apps on mine Dogecoin in your mobile Play Store either allow you to manage mine Dogecoin in your mobile remote cloud mining tasks, or pay out rewards and giveaways in some other fashion. Q. But I found a mining app on mine Dogecoin in your mobile Internet. Couldn't I just sideload it? A. While Google doesn't stop you from sideloading an app, we can give you two reasons why you shouldn't even consider it. Firstly, most security experts agree that sideloaded apps from third-parties are usually riddled with malware. Since mine Dogecoin in your mobile app developers don't have to adhere to mine Dogecoin in your mobile strict guidelines imposed by mine Dogecoin in your mobile app stores, what's stopping them from sneaking in malware under mine Dogecoin in your mobile garb of a legitimate app. And do you know what's mine Dogecoin in your mobile most common type of mobile malware floating around these days? Cryptomining malware! Q. Wait, what? A. Yes, and this brings us to mine Dogecoin in your mobile second point. Like we've said before, smartphones don't have mine Dogecoin in your mobile kind of processing prowess that's required to mine crypto in any meaningful fashion. For instance, according to estimates, mine Dogecoin in your mobile HTC Exodus 1S smartphone, which comes with its own mining app, will take over a century to mine enough crypto to pay for itself! For instance, mine Dogecoin in your mobile way mine Dogecoin in your mobile software that mines bitcoins is written, while mine Dogecoin in your mobile time taken to produce a bitcoin doesn't vary, mine Dogecoin in your mobile computing power used to produce it does. This means that as more people join mine Dogecoin in your mobile Bitcoin network and try to mine bitcoins, more computing power is used to make a bitcoin. While computing mine Dogecoin in your mobile real cost of minting cryptocurrency is a long drawn process, and is constantly evolving, it is safe to say that you'll end up spending more money in electricity and cooling costs than mine Dogecoin in your mobile value of mine Dogecoin in your mobile mined crypto. So instead of borrowing a supercomputer, malware writers hijack mine Dogecoin in your mobile processor in your mobile phone (and computers) and use them to mine crypto.

It might be Year of mine Dogecoin in your mobile Ox in China, but for mine Dogecoin in your mobile crypto world, it is mine Dogecoin in your mobile Year of mine Dogecoin in your mobile Dog. The Shiba Inu-based meme currency dogecoin has zoomed 13,000% since mine Dogecoin in your mobile start of mine Dogecoin in your mobile year and is showing no signs of stopping. Mint explores. Ah, cryptocurrency. The dream of a digital asset that is based not on paper money backed by gold or silver but built on secure transactions and a decentralized network that is open to all. Well, it's a lot more complicated than that and in mine Dogecoin in your mobile year 2021, there are more cryptocurrencies than any sane person can keep track of. Unless you live under a rock, you've probably heard of Bitcoin which is widely considered mine Dogecoin in your mobile first-every cryptocurrency and also birthed mine Dogecoin in your mobile blockchain technology behind most cryptocurrencies. I'll spare you mine Dogecoin in your mobile long, drawn-out details of how it works because honestly, I'm really not that well-versed in mine Dogecoin in your mobile technology myself. To dumb it down, many cryptocurrencies are built on blockchain tech that utilizes various types of computers and networks to confirm digital transactions. In mine Dogecoin in your mobile process, digital coin, or crypto, is mined as a reward to mine Dogecoin in your mobile miners confirming mine Dogecoin in your mobile transactions. These are called mining rewards. Again, there's way more to it than that but you can go to Wikipedia or a million other sites to find out more details on how it all works. While cryptocurrencies offer mine Dogecoin in your mobile promise of decentralization and security with many boasting anonymous online transactions, there is no good without some bad, and crypto has its fair share of negatives. For starters, mine Dogecoin in your mobile anonymous nature of many cryptocurrencies has led to digital tokens being mine Dogecoin in your mobile currency of choice for a lot of dark web activity and other nefarious practices. That said, anything that involves money has mine Dogecoin in your mobile potential to be used for evil and cryptocurrency is in no way mine Dogecoin in your mobile first asset to be used in an unsavory manner. The bigger, more obvious problem with most cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Monero is that they require intense amounts of computing power and electricity to be profitable. When mine Dogecoin in your mobile Bitcoin blockchain first launched over a decade ago, users could easily mine large amounts of Bitcoin from personal devices. Of course, back then Bitcoin was nearly worthless at less than a penny per coin until a significant price bump to $0.08 per coin in 2010. Fast forward a decade and Bitcoin is now priced at more than $57,000 and even broke mine Dogecoin in your mobile $60K mark earlier this year. Mining even a single Bitcoin in 2021would take years using a powerful GPU like mine Dogecoin in your mobile NVIDIA GTX 3090. It would take more than a year just to recover mine Dogecoin in your mobile cost of mine Dogecoin in your mobile GPU before you actually made a profit and that's not taking into consideration mine Dogecoin in your mobile cost of electricity. This is mine Dogecoin in your mobile main reason it is nearly impossible to get a good GPU at a decent price right now. It is also mine Dogecoin in your mobile reason for mine Dogecoin in your mobile birth of mining-specific hardware known as ASIC miners. These are powerful, energy-hungry rigs that do nothing except mine currencies. Because of mine Dogecoin in your mobile cost involved, mining has become completely impractical for hobbyists and general consumers.Anyway, that's enough on mine Dogecoin in your mobile history lesson. If you follow any crypto news at all, you've likely seen a lot of reports on a little digital asset known as Dogecoin. With its signature Shiba Inu mascot, Doge was created in 2013 by a couple of software engineers as somewhat of a joke. The goal was to create a coin that was more accessible to mine Dogecoin in your mobile masses with faster transaction times and lower fees than Bitcoin. Until recently, Doge has been worth less than a penny and yet, it has a massive \\u2013 almost cult-like \\u2013 following on mine Dogecoin in your mobile internet. As of late, more and more big names have jumped on mine Dogecoin in your mobile Dogecoin bandwagon and mine Dogecoin in your mobile broader acknowledgments from major companies, expanded listing on major exchanges and billionaires like Elon Musk heralding mine Dogecoin in your mobile coin have driven mine Dogecoin in your mobile price of Doge to record highs. In mine Dogecoin in your mobile past year, Dogecoin has risen an astounding 24,000% from a fraction of a penny to over $0.60 per coin. Like Bitcoin, Doge is mined mostly by miners and farms with hardware designed solely for this purpose. However, there are still some that mine from home using gaming PCs or GPU rigs in mine Dogecoin in your mobile hopes of cashing in on mine Dogecoin in your mobile Doge phenomenon. This has led me to a user request asking if it is possible to mine Doge (or other cryptos) on a Chromebook.  Mining Crypto on Chrome OS  If you take a quick poke around mine Dogecoin in your mobile web, you'll find that most agree that mining cryptocurrency with a CPU-only PC is 100% unprofitable and, for mine Dogecoin in your mobile most part, they're right. There are some altcoins out there that can still be mined with a CPU and with some luck, you might make enough to pay for your week's coffee but don't hold your breath. Still, you know me. I'm willing to give anything Chrome OS-related a try just to say I did it. So, I found a Linux-based mining software that installs easily on Chrome OS and I gave it a try. If you're a tinkerer like me and you want to give it a go, here's how you can actually mine Dogecoin on a Chromebook or Chrome OS device that has Linux app support.There are numerous miners out there that will work on Ubuntu and Debian systems. Some have graphical interfaces and that does make it easier for mine Dogecoin in your mobile beginning users. However, mine Dogecoin in your mobile Linux container on Chrome OS often struggles using GUI apps because of mine Dogecoin in your mobile nature of mine Dogecoin in your mobile container and VM it uses. Plus, a GUI takes up CPU power and you want all mine Dogecoin in your mobile power you can get for your mining software. For this, we are going to use a CLI miner that runs in mine Dogecoin in your mobile terminal and you can track mine Dogecoin in your mobile progress on mine Dogecoin in your mobile back end of mine Dogecoin in your mobile mining pool where you and other miners pool PC power to mine blocks and gain rewards in Dogecoin. This particular miner is built off of mine Dogecoin in your mobile cpuminer-multi used by many CPU miners for a wide variety of coins. I found that it requires mine Dogecoin in your mobile least amount of hoops to get up and running on Chrome OS and it only takes a few commands to get started. Once installed, we'll look at how to start and monitor your miner.  Before you get started with mining, you'll need a place to store your earnings. For this, you need a wallet. There are many types of wallets out there. Some can be installed locally on your machine while others can be used on mobile devices. There are multi-wallets that can be used to store, exchange, and even purchase various cryptocurrencies and there are wallets specific to Dogecoin only. The one you choose is up to you but for this experiment, I chose to go with mine Dogecoin in your mobile online Doge wallet from http://Block.io because it is fully encrypted and you can access it anywhere that you can get online. Also, mine Dogecoin in your mobile wallet isn't custodial. You own mine Dogecoin in your mobile coin and you alone have access to your privately encrypted wallet. To set up a new Doge wallet, head over to Dogechain and create a new one. Be sure to save your private wallet ID and password somewhere offline for security's sake. Once you've set up your new wallet, navigate to mine Dogecoin in your mobile receive tab and get your unique Dogecoin address. You will need this for mine Dogecoin in your mobile miner's script. Don't worry about mine Dogecoin in your mobile safety of mine Dogecoin in your mobile address. Crypto addresses are generally used for only sending or receiving, not both. No one can access your funds or your wallet with this receiving address. On to mine Dogecoin in your mobile miner.  To get started, you will need to make sure your device is set up and ready to use Linux applications. You can learn more about that in this getting started article here. Up to date? Great. Here we go. Before you install mine Dogecoin in your mobile miner, you will need to download a couple of dependencies not present in Debian 10 by default. These are simply Linux packages that are used to compile and build other packages. You can install them all at once by pasting mine Dogecoin in your mobile following command in your Linux terminal and hitting enter. At mine Dogecoin in your mobile prompt, press y or simply hit enter to confirm mine Dogecoin in your mobile installation.  That's it. Your CPU miner is now ready to run. Keep in mind, this is going to put mine Dogecoin in your mobile spurs to your CPU and all or your cores will likely be maxed out while mine Dogecoin in your mobile miner is running. Don't plan on using your device for anything else while mine Dogecoin in your mobile cpuminer is running and you should also be aware that this will be very taxing on your hardware. The CPUs are going to run hot and long-term use of this miner could result in damage to your device. This is just an experiment. If you don't feel comfortable with it or don't know how to manage your thermals, DON'T DO IT. Okay, that's out of mine Dogecoin in your mobile way. To start your miner, you should be in mine Dogecoin in your mobile cpuminer-opt folder. If not, use mine Dogecoin in your mobile cd command to get there. There are a number of pools where you can mine Doge or mine other coins that can be automatically converted to Dogecoin. We're going to use Zpool because it is easy to use and you don't have to create an account to hook your miner up and monitor your mining. To get your miner started, run mine Dogecoin in your mobile following command replacing wallet address with mine Dogecoin in your mobile receiving address you created for your Dogecoin wallet.There you go. You will be able to see your current hash rate and accepted shares in mine Dogecoin in your mobile terminal. To keep an eye on your earnings (which will be very little) you can paste your wallet address into Zpool for real-time stats. I fired up this miner on a Core i5 Chromebox with 8GB of RAM right before I started writing this post. In roughly two hours, I have earned about .016 Doge or roughly one cent. Needless to say, a Chrome OS device shouldn't be your first pick if you're looking at getting into mining crypto at home. Maybe mine Dogecoin in your mobile Tiger Lake devices on mine Dogecoin in your mobile way can leverage some GPU power and do a bit better but I'd guess it won't be worth mine Dogecoin in your mobile price of mine Dogecoin in your mobile hardware or mine Dogecoin in your mobile electricity it takes to mine. I'm not here to give investment advice and I'm certainly not telling you to purchase cryptocurrencies. However, if you are wanting to hop on mine Dogecoin in your mobile Doge train, you will be better served to purchase some coin from a trusted exchange like Binance. If you already own some digital currency and you want to swap it out, you can quickly exchange a number of major cryptocurrencies for little more than mine Dogecoin in your mobile network fee at ChangeNOW and you'll have your Doge in just a couple of hours. For all you Shibes out there, see you on mine Dogecoin in your mobile moon.

They claim to be building a new Blockchain Network, which they actually have up on TestNet. They plan on going live in June. And the Mining app will stop working after Dec 12th. All that sounds pretty okay, but then it starts getting scammy.  They make several references to Satoshi and claim he is the one making this app. Craig Wright was recently (3 months ago) proven in a court of law to be Satoshi. And he really did make a new Bitcoin, and it already does everything these guys claim theirs might do later. It is called BSV, and is currently worth $99.  They also claim they will let you mine for 2 years, yet say mining will end in Dec 12, 2022.

No mining app should Ever have a KYC, and in fact, it is direct opposition to what Satoshi wrote. Calling themselves Satoshi anything is an insult to the Real Satoshi, Craig Wright.

Unfortunately, these market market movements and price pumps are unsustainable and tend to crash, which is exactly what happened. I think the market has learned its lesson and serious crypto investors value each and every crypto asset utility, what it can bring to the table, does it have a working product and what problem does it try to solve. There will be always short term pumps and dumps but I strongly believe sustainability in crypto can be achieved only by having a strong utility behind a crypto asset.  Crypto projects which do not have that will simply disappear and dogecoin is classic example of this category. It does not solve anything, it does not have any distinctive characteristics and no real reason to own it besides waiting for a miraculous pump.

In fact, I believe Dogecoin could reach one dollar per coin. Powered by meme virality, unique branding, and its eventual utility as a currency, Dogecoin is a perfect storm that is poised to soar. Let me explain.  These days, there are a lot of legitimate offers online that gives great advantage to cryptocurrency investors where they get good returns of their invested cryptocurrency on platforms like CryptoFXnetwork Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www . cryptofxnetwork . com). These are opportunities that need to be really utilized to its maximum.  On the date of publication, Steph Brooks did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.  Steph Brooks, CFA, is a registered investment advisor on a mission to bring simplicity to the world of investing.  1. Dogecoin is a Meme. That gives it power.  Memes are ideas, they are decentralized inside-jokes. Their hive mind virality spreads like wildfire in the cultural zeitgeist. Like a virus, memes mutate and adapt, blending with other memes to appropriate trends. Their parabolic growth is expedited due to the inter-connectedness of our social media world.  Like the GameStop phenomenon, Dogecoin is fueled by memes, fervor, and a decentralized community of retail investors. The GameStop short squeeze was propelled by viral memes in the WallStreetBets Reddit community. Memes like we like the stock! and diamond hands lit a fire under the movement, with jokes about tendies, stonks, and degenerate trading fueling the blaze. Doge is a meme, and as we've seen, memes take on a life of their own. They are not to be underestimated.  Words like much, wow, and many are popular in Doge memes like this one.  Most memes usually peak and die out, but some stick around. And here's the thing with Doge: it's Lindy. It's been around for an unusually long time. That gives it a higher probability of surviving even longer.  As the meme expands and its utility as a cryptocurrency is actualized, Dogecoin will grow in popularity and value. Although currently floating around four cents, it could eventually reach a dollar. Dogecoin to a dollar has become a part of the meme. #DogecoinToADollar, which has recently been trending on twitter, may be a prophesy of what's to come.  2. Dogecoin has strong and unique branding  Branding is important. It influences our purchasing decisions and our sentiment towards products, services, and ideas. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies, so branding matters for public adoption. Bitcoin is at the forefront of the cryptocurrency revolution because of its strong and unique branding.  For Bitcoin to act as its intended purpose as the reserve currency of the world, it cannot be beholden to any state, country, or individual. Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, fortified the integrity of the Bitcoin system by remaining anonymous and never cashing out his early coffers. This, along with its originality and resilience, gives Bitcoin a strong brand foundation.  Similar to Bitcoin, Dogecoin also has strong and unique branding. Dogecoin is symbolized by the Shiba Inu dog meme. Its logo is a cute dog. Other cryptocurrencies don't have a logo as memorable or funny. It's ironic for something so silly like a dog-meme to be associated with such a serious financial asset. It makes a mockery of traditional cryptocurrency networks. Plus, who doesn't love dogs?  Dogecoin's logo is symbolized by its official mascot, a Shiba Inu dog  Propelling the Dogecoin zeal is Elon Musk, who regularly tweets about the coin and previously touted himself as the former CEO of Dogecoin. Decentralized ideas are often helmed by an unofficial but bonafide leader. Satoshi Nakamoto for Bitcoin, u/DeepFuckingValue for GameStop, and now Elon Musk for Dogecoin.  With influential individuals like Elon Musk leading the Dogecoin choir, the cryptocurrency stands to gain from its growing brand popularity as hoards of young people share #DogecoinArmy, #DogecoinToTheMoon, and #DogeToADollar, spreading the meme mania on Reddit, TikTok, and Twitter.  Elon Musk shared this Doge meme on January 28th, 2021 on his Twitter, causing Dogecoin to surge 300%  3. Dogecoin is an anti-establishment movement. This fuels growth.  The GameStop short squeeze has shown us that people are fed up with the financial establishment.

Today, dogecoin is one of the major coins that has attracted a lot of attention from traders and investors.  When dogecoin started, it was traded at $0.00 and has had steady growth over the years. The coin now ranks as part of the top 5 most valuable cryptocurrencies in the world. The dogecoin still traded lower than $0.09 earlier this year, but it has had an amazing spike as it grew from $0.089 to around $0.7 between April and May, which is over 300% growth within a month. The market speculators are also predicting that it would still make more bullish moves, which has raised much more interest in the coin.  Choosing the right broker to buy dogecoin  Traders can make a lot from trading the dogecoin, but it might just end in tears with the wrong choice of broker. With the rate at which fraudulent brokers keep increasing, it is necessary to be cautious of brokerage companies' choices in trading dogecoin.

Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile, and dogecoin has been on an absolute tear this year. It's up more than 12,000% since January and has gained 800% this month alone. Musk has been Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL loudest and most prominent supporter of dogecoin.

But it's no longer a joke: It's Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL fifth-largest cryptocurrency in Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL world, with a market value just south of $70 billion, according to Coinbase. Both dogecoin and Tesla had been trading higher in anticipation of Musk's SNL appearance. Tesla futures weren't trading Saturday night during Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL show. It's unclear what was driving Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL dogecoin selloff.

But more likely, there was some \\\"buy Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL rumor / sell Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL news\\\" strategy, trying to capitalize on investors' predictions coming true by selling high. Dogecoin does none of this. And it adds no driving reason behind its incredible rise to date. The moral of this Dogecoin story is that Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL market price has moved not due to fundamental values nor being a differentiated asset. Instead, it has moved largely thanks to social media pumpers and media bodies. That has made for a fantastic ride (and plenty of bragging rights) for early speculators. But it doesn't make for a sustainable investment strategy.Dogecoin is a name that Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL've most likely heard, even if Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL aren't really invested in cryptocurrencies. Elon Musk, easily Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL most outspoken tech entrepreneur (and human being, in general), has put in a pretty regular night shift, pushing Dogecoin upward in its price trajectory. Later tonight, Musk is expected to host Saturday Night Live, where one of Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL things that he's expected to talk about are cryptocurrencies \\u2013 and Dogecoin specifically. The question, though, is this \\u2013 is this for real? STARTED AS A JOKE Dogecoin, named after Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL affectionate internet meme slang for dogs, was started as a fun alternative to Bitcoin by two software engineers, Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer. Without any specific commercial application at hand, Dogecoin was simply meant to be a casual crypto coin that stood more as an ideological instrument for decentralised digital currencies against Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL formal fiat ones. That is what it remained to be for Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL longest time, until Tesla and SpaceX chief Elon Musk sent out word on his Twitter profile, urging users to buy Dogecoin. Known for his fairly controversial opinions on a lot of topics, Musk's tweet wasn't a solitary one. Since then, he's offered a fairly regular commentary on it. Labelling it as people's crypto, Musk has largely remained bullish on Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL prospect of Dogecoin one day becoming a real currency.BIGGER THAN MANY COMPANIES Today, Dogecoin's market capitalisation value stands close to $91 billion. In comparative terms, Dogecoin has a bigger market cap than companies such as Uber, General Motors, FedEx, Snap and BNP Paribas. For a cryptocurrency that was billed as just a joke, Dogecoin today stands at a point where it cannot really be termed as a casual, fun iteration of cryptocurrencies any longer. It is this that has led many crypto traditionalists and conservatives to state that Dogecoin is highly overvalued and largely speculative. As a result, many crypto indices, trading firms and asset management companies have chosen to give Dogecoin a complete miss. The reason is fairly simple \\u2013 most digital currency investors believe that Dogecoin is too speculative and does not have any stop loss margins. At Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL same time, though, some more progressive ones have taken to offering Dogecoin as a valid digital currency for trading. Even there, despite its 80x surge taking its price all Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL way up to Rs 50, Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL worries of its inflated valuation remain. VOLATILITY VS OPTIMISM Can Musk's optimism pull Dogecoin to greater heights, in turn making it a serious cryptocurrency? While more can be expected from Musk's session later tonight, what does remain is an undeniable point that even after its record rally, Dogecoin remains a sketchy option at best. It still has very little to offer apart from inflated optimism pushing its value up. Without any major holding from retail investors, such a bubble can burst any time, hence bringing Dogecoin's value down at any point.Bitcoin dropped to a three-month low on Monday as investors sold cryptocurrencies in Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL wake of Tesla boss Elon Musk's hinting over Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL weekend that Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL carmarker is considering or may have already sold some of its bitcoin holdings.

Dogecoin fell nearly 7 percent to $0.48, and all three are well under recent records. Last week Musk said Tesla would stop taking bitcoin as payment, owing to environmental concerns about energy use to process transactions. Defending that decision on Sunday, he suggested Tesla may have sold its own holdings. In response to an unverified Twitter account called @CryptoWhale, which said: Bitcoiners are going to slap themselves next quarter when they find out Tesla dumped Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL rest of their #Bitcoin holdings. With Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL amount of hate @elonmusk is getting, I wouldn't blame him\\u2026,\\\" Musk wrote: Indeed\\\".It is not clear whether he was confirming sales or whether he referred only to Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL fact that he had faced criticism. Last week Musk said Tesla would not sell its bitcoin, but Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL cyrptocurrency has dropped by almost a quarter since Musk's reversal on Tesla taking it as payment. Dogecoin is also yet to fully recover from Musk describing it as a hustle,\\\" although he did boost Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL price last week by saying he was working to improve its efficiency.

There's no hard cap on Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL number of coins that can be minted using Dogecoin crash after Elon Musk hosted SNL computer code governing Dogecoin.

Too many unreasonable expectations by people who thought they were going to get rich quickly. When things did not go as expected too many rushed for the exit and many of those investors were in Robinhood. As Robinhoods hot wallet was quickly being drained of all available dogecoins the people at Robinhood had no choice but to halt the trading of cryptocurrency on their platform. Robinhood had about $2B of dogecoin held in their hot wallet into the SNL episode but it was quickly heading to $0. By stoping the bleeding Robinhood pretty much put the stop to the panic. We are in a new kind of era of unregulated trading of cryptocurrency. Robinhood suffers little consequence from having to halt trading in a cryptocurrency at their discretion."}, {"upvote": 3, "content": "You should know, its not doge coin. Its Elon coin .

WILD.  Similar instances happened with Elon and Crypto. His tweets are monitored by so many people now days, cause his statements has the power to change the market.  So, during the SNL show, he joked that he would gift some dogecoin to her mother, probably as as mother day gift. As soon as this statement was seen by the general public, doge coin crashed. I don't know, why the stock price dropped after him saying that. If I was an investor, I would have presumed the price to go up.  Nevertheless, this is what happened.

The currency question  Bitcoin and Dogecoin are examples of decentralized currencies, akin to dollars, Euros, etc.  For these currencies to succeed, the people you want to exchange money with must use the same currency. The benefit is fast and cheap (sometimes) payments.  Cheap is 'sometimes' because if these people don't use the same currency, you have to have someone in between who will buy your currency in exchange for the currency that the other people do want to receive.   Payment processors like Coinbase [ https://www.quora.com/topic/Coinbase ] and BitPay [ https://www.quora.com/topic/BitPay ] exist because some merchants want to accept Bitcoin, but want to ultimately receive dollars. These processors charge transaction fees and provide their own FX/currency-conversion rates.  The payment system question  Ripple (payment network) [ https://www.quora.com/topic/Ripple-payment-network ] is an example of a decentralized payment network, akin to ACH, SWIFT, or other interbank payment systems.   For this system to succeed, you can deal in any currency you want (USD, EUR, BTC, LTC...), and the people you want to exchange money with can deal in any currency that they want. The benefit is also fast and cheap payments.  Since Ripple supports both the movement and conversion of currencies, you don't need to rely on a centralized payment processor. Instead, you get access to open-market FX exchange rates, and you don't get charged transaction fees.  The both question  The fundamental difference between the success of currencies vs. payment systems is coexistence.   In a Bitcoin-only world, Dogecoin, USD, EUR... these other currencies can't exist.  However, in a Ripple-only world, any currency - all of the above and whatever else you can think of - can continue to exist."}, {"upvote": 54, "content": "If you were to ask 10 different people what makes a cryptocurrency successful, you would get 10 different answers. And yet, today's wave of crypto-mania makes this a relevant question. Since the start of 2017, cryptocurrency valuations have stuttered their way to giddy new highs. In August, for the first time ever, the total value of cryptocurrencies exceeded $150bn \\u2013 up from $25bn just five months earlier.  Before i continue, Incase you are worried about what all these cryptocurrencies are heading to, DON'T GIVE UP!!! I almost gave up too but after much investigations to fine a legit platform where i can safely invest my portfolios, i came across Multicoinhodler Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www .multicoinhodler .com where i get good returns of my invested cryptocurrency after 10 trading days. I also mine with them and most importantly store my bitcoin securely with them. Don't be left out. Be like me. I still believe in Cryptocurrency. Be careful out there for there are so many fake investment website claiming to be paying.  By the beginning of September 2017, the market capitalisation of bitcoin had surged by 500 percent since the beginning of the year. And yet, bitcoin itself is not the main focus of the crypto-boom \\u2013 this is instead centred on the less-well-known world of \\u2018altcoins'. In fact, at the time of writing, the two biggest cryptocurrencies following bitcoin \\u2013 Ripple and Ether \\u2013 have both seen their market capitalisation rocket by over 2,000 percent since the start of 2017.  As a result, bitcoin is no longer the all-dominating presence it once was. For years it has taken up around 80 percent of the sector, but its market capitalisation has now dipped below that of the combined total of other cryptocoins. This brings its market presence to below 50 percent for the first time ever.  New bids on the block There are now close to 1,000 cryptocurrencies in existence, and success stories are easy to come by. At the more outrageous end of the spectrum is Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency built around an internet meme. Initially introduced as a joke, the currency's logo features \\u2018doge', the wide-eyed Shiba Inu dog-turned-meme, who is accompanied by meme-inspired font, Comic Sans.  Despite the fact it was more or less invented as a parody cryptocurrency, the coin quickly gained a network of admirers willing to buy in. The concept was popular, and in the world of cryptocurrencies, popularity equals value. Dogecoin recently jumped to a market capitalisation of $189m.  The story of Dogecoin is an excellent reflection of the absurdity of the cryptocurrency market, but this is also just one side of it. The reality is that while it appears as if bubbles are emerging in every corner of the market, cryptocurrencies also have a growing number of more practical uses.  Many crypto success stories consist of those currencies that were created in bitcoin's image, but with various tweaks to make them function a little better. The result is a scattering of competing currencies with attributes that can be handpicked depending on one's personal priorities, be it security, privacy, anonymity or speed. For instance, Litecoin was set up in 2011 and is almost technologically identical to bitcoin. However, it boasts certain enhancements, like a more efficient mining protocol and a greater processing speed for transactions.  It reached a market capitalisation of $4bn for the first time in September, and is now the fifth most successful cryptocurrency (by market capitalisation) after bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ripple and Ether. Another example is Monero, which offers a similar function to bitcoin, but with enhanced privacy and improvements in scalability. Working on a similar theme, Anoncoin boasts strict anonymity, while Stablecoin claims to have military-grade encryption.  Many such currencies were able to gain traction by tackling bitcoin's faults. And yet, the recent excitement behind two of the most successful cryptocurrencies is focused on possible applications beyond those of bitcoin and its lookalikes: According to Hanna Halaburda, author of Beyond Bitcoin: The Economics of Digital Currencies: While bitcoin is a self-contained cryptocurrency, Ether and [Ripple] are cryptocurrencies supporting broader systems, each with a different functionality.  Ripple makes waves Perhaps more than any other, Ripple's tailor-made currency XRP is the cryptocurrency of the moment. It caught headlines earlier this year after its value increased by 4,000 percent in the first half of 2017.  Ripple itself is a start-up that provides the framework for a cross-border payments system. Its primary motivation is to tackle the very practical problem of the world's slow and costly payments architecture. Its protocol supports various currencies, including bitcoin, dollars and even units of value like frequent flyer miles.  XRP's characteristics are determined by its role within the wider framework. According to Daniel Aranda, Managing Director of Ripple's European division: That includes a few requirements. One is scalability \\u2013 the XRP blockchain is already able to handle over 1,000 transactions per second. It also includes speed \\u2013 you can actually settle on the blockchain within just two to five seconds.  Ripple's goal is to build a next-generation cross-border payment system that will allow for any unit of value \\u2013 whether it's a dollar, a bitcoin, or even a tenth of a penny \\u2013 to be moved easily around the world in a matter of seconds.  Part of the momentum behind Ripple is its emphasis on carving out a position in the established financial system. While bitcoin operates largely outside the system, Ripple has now partnered with more than 100 banks, and is developing software that is specifically tailored towards bringing solutions to players in the sector.  Aranda explained: Our whole goal as a company is to take blockchain and cryptocurrency out of a more experimental and speculative mindset, and have it be driven by the real economic activity, which abides by real use cases.  While Ripple's attention is now concentrated on cross-border payment infrastructure, its wider goal is much more ambitious. We think that these cryptocurrencies and new protocols will be able to create an internet of value, said Aranda. One protocol currently under development is the interledger, which can connect blockchain ledger technology with traditional centralised ledgers.  This kind of infrastructure, according to Aranda, could enable a whole series of use cases that we can't even imagine yet, and could provide the basis of a whole new generation of online businesses.  In essence, for Ripple, the XRP currency is simply a tool through which to achieve some very practical goals."}, {"upvote": 5, "content": "Is a better payment system needed in the world?

One argument for its growth is the amount of coins it has. To that I respond with the physical currencies. They have no gold backing, they can issue unlimited currency and inflation can go up in a day.  Meanwhile doge you know what to expect. It has a steady supply that cannot be increased or decreased. Many wallets that had a lot of doge are inactive so we can consider some of them lost bringing the amount down. Bitcoin for example has 20% of its supply lost forever. I thing doge is more trustworthy than our dollar, euro etc. Tomorrow the fed can say we will issue trillions of dollars. Who is gonna stop them?  Market cap is pointless when we talk about currencies. I don't know who made this a trend but currencies are not assets. They are not companies. Bitcoin used to worth pennies. Did anyone care about market cap then? Now they cap doge to the bitcoin market cap. Even if we do accept that if doge coin raises in price x10 now it will still be under bitcoin in market cap making its price go to 2.5 euros.  Don't pay attention to market cap. I mined doge 8 years ago.eft them on my wallet and just waited. Back then they were worth 17 euros. Do the math.  There are wallets with huge amounts and they didn't sell at 0.6$ why do you think is that?  First wallet is the Robin hood one even if they don't admit it. That's because in that platform you don't trade doge. You trade its price. That's why you can't take them out of the platform. Robin hood is the main reason doge is low in price. When they allow doge to be in private wallets then the price will skyrocket.  I am not a financial advisor and I am not giving you financial advice.

I can mine many per day take them to an exchange and if I try real hard I can get maybe 0.00000035 BTC or if I am patient even 0.00000045 BTC per coin.  Thus from a miners point of view Doge is worth more than is stated on its profile because as a miner once you mine that coin, its all yours and you can get more than its worth because a miner does something a trader can never do, and that is, make their own stocks to sell.  Doge has been at about .006 average for a long time. So when its .01 its at a penny. Considering it started at 0.00000001, it has moved a long way considering its a tier 2 coin.

This above mentioned is based on my own experience dealing with CryptoFXnetwork.  Dogecoin is best recognized as the cryptocurrency that stemmed from an online joke and rose to become a serious rival to bitcoin. Many dogecoin fans still refer to it as the joke currency. The altcoin is created by Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus. It has been accepted on many crypto exchanges and trades under the ticker symbol DOGE.  Musk has said that dogecoin is his favorite cryptocurrency. The electric vehicle billionaire hasn't offered his dogecoin price predictions, but he thinks that the altcoin has great potential. For example, Musk has suggested that dogecoin could become the global financial system's cryptocurrency standard.  Although Musk's shout-outs have helped dogecoin's price, little is known about his dogecoin holdings. The billionaire revealed in May 2020 that he only owned 0.25 bitcoins, which a friend gifted him.  How dogecoin did in 2020  The cryptocurrency world made a range of dogecoin price predictions in 2020. Some people expected a boom, while others predicted a burst for the altcoin. At the end of the day, dogecoin gained more than 130 percent in 2020. The amount looks great for a tiny altcoin vying for attention in a crowded crypto scene. Bitcoin and Ethereum gained 300 percent and 460 percent, respectively.  Musk's tweets and the TikTok campaign helped boost dogecoin's price in 2020. The shift to online shopping in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic also helped the currency.  Dozens of online merchants from snack vendors to ebook sellers and web hosting providers accept dogecoin as a payment. Many people looking to pay with cryptocurrency wanted dogecoin."}, {"upvote": 25, "content": "Buying Ethereum with PayPal is not the best, but this option is very convenient. Still, you should remember that this method has some downsides too. By clicking on this link \\u2014 https://www.banklesstimes.com/cryptocurrency/ethereum/buy/with-paypal/, you can find more details on how to buy Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies like BTC via PayPal.  One of them is that you need to find a seller who will accept PayPal as a paying method, considering that not all trading platforms allow you to pay with the PayPal e-wallet. It means that one of the first steps to buying Ethereum is to look for an exchange where PayPal is listed as one of the possible payment methods.  There are hundreds of cryptocurrency exchanges. Of these, only a few dozen are regulated. That is, they are registered with the department of a country and operate following its legislation. In addition to the fact that such exchanges pay more attention to security, as they are required to meet the standards of a financial institution, they also assume obligations to depositors. Typically, such sites apply KYC (know your customer) rules to all users. This means that each new member of the community must go through identification to start working with the exchange.  Another advantage of regulated exchanges is the ability to deposit and withdraw funds in a large number of ways. Sites that operate only on trust usually don't bother with the comfort of customers. Often, only cryptocurrency trading is provided without the ability to carry out transactions for fiat.  Finally, the cost of cryptocurrencies is not controlled by any state in the world. Central banks also have no influence on tokens, so only investors trading on exchanges determine the volatility of coins. Suppose a user decides to trade ETH or purchase it as a long-term asset. In that case, it is necessary to conduct a thorough analysis of the rates and conditions offered by various cryptocurrency exchanges, exchange services, and private sellers."}, {"upvote": 13, "content": "Where Can I Buy Dogecoin With My Credit/Debit Card?

I'll explain in a point and try to get at the motivation for this question in another.  #1 Why Doge Won't Go to $20  Right now, $DOGE is trading at around $.6 a coin. If you take that and multiply it by the total number of coins in existence, you get to its market capitalization, which is $79 billion (roughly).  If $DOGE were to go to $20, then its market cap would be $2.6 trillion. That's 2.6x Bitcoin's market cap.  That would make it more valuable than the most valuable company in the world, Saudi Aramco (at $2.5 trillion) and Apple (at $2.4 trillion).  Just no. Not going to happen. Certainly not in the next 12 months and not likely in the next 5 years.  #2 The Motivation For This Question  The motivation for this question is simple: if $DOGE were to go to $20, then it would do a little better than 33x.  So, I assume the questioner wants to know whether $DOGE can do at least 30x. The answer is no.  You are too late to this pump. Get over it and choose another one.  There are so many other cryptos out there that could do this\\u2014but you have to go outside the top 10 coins. You'll have to look at those in the 110 - 75 range (ranked by market cap).  My two favorite at or outside the top 100, because they are related to broader ecosystems are:  1. Voyager Token ($VGX) [ https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/voyager-token/ ], which is used for the Voyager Exchange. This exchange is available in the US and actually doesn't rip people off for their trades like Coinbase. It also lets you get interest 10% on your tokens right there (v. Coinbase's top yield of 2%). 2. Flow ($FLOW) [ https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/flow/ ], which is a layer 1 scalable blockchain by the developers of CryptoKitties and TopShot. Will it really beat $ETH? That's unlikely, but it could find a niche space and pump 10x. Ok, so there you go. The above statements are not recommendations for any of these, since the whole space is crazy right now. I just wanted to give you a sense of what it takes to pump even 10x.  The top 100 coins all have a market cap above $1 billion right now! So, those large gains are harder to find.

Dogecoin was created in the early days of crypto, soon after major players like Bitcoin and Litecoin.  The original idea behind Dogecoin was to create a more memorable cryptocurrency project to help the public understand the technology behind blockchains. For more information you can submit a request [ https://www.800-number.info/coinbase-phone-number/ ] to Coinbase.  Since then, Dogecoin has become an icon in the internet-powered retail investor era we live in today. The meme coin's logo, the Shiba Inu, has been hard to avoid in 2021. Dogecoin is built on the same basic technology as other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.  However, DOGE introduces a few improvements to Bitcoin's technology to enable users to access faster and more affordable transactions. While this is the case, other cryptocurrencies offer better, more innovative solutions to lessen transaction costs.  Dogecoin isn't groundbreaking by any means, but Dogecoin investors aren't betting on the cryptocurrency's technology. Instead, the so-called Doge Army is betting on the robust community around DOGE.  The first step to buying Dogecoin is to open an account with a cryptocurrency exchange that supports DOGE. Dogecoin is available on Coinbase, eToro, Robinhood, Gemini, SoFi and Webull.  SoFi is a great option for a few reasons. Investors who sign up for SoFi will receive free bitcoin for a limited time, giving you exposure to cryptocurrency without having to risk your own money.  Plus, SoFi let's investors buy and sell other assets, such as IPOs and exchange traded funds. After both your wallet and your exchange account are open, you can place a buy order to purchase DOGE.

In fact, I believe Dogecoin could reach one dollar per coin. Powered by meme virality, unique branding, and its eventual utility as a currency, Dogecoin is a perfect storm that is poised to soar. Let me explain.  These days, there are a lot of legitimate offers online that gives great advantage to cryptocurrency investors where they get good returns of their invested cryptocurrency on platforms like CryptoFXnetwork Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www . cryptofxnetwork . com). These are opportunities that need to be really utilized to its maximum.  On the date of publication, Steph Brooks did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.  Steph Brooks, CFA, is a registered investment advisor on a mission to bring simplicity to the world of investing.  1. Dogecoin is a Meme. That gives it power.  Memes are ideas, they are decentralized inside-jokes. Their hive mind virality spreads like wildfire in the cultural zeitgeist. Like a virus, memes mutate and adapt, blending with other memes to appropriate trends. Their parabolic growth is expedited due to the inter-connectedness of our social media world.  Like the GameStop phenomenon, Dogecoin is fueled by memes, fervor, and a decentralized community of retail investors. The GameStop short squeeze was propelled by viral memes in the WallStreetBets Reddit community. Memes like we like the stock! and diamond hands lit a fire under the movement, with jokes about tendies, stonks, and degenerate trading fueling the blaze. Doge is a meme, and as we've seen, memes take on a life of their own. They are not to be underestimated.  Words like much, wow, and many are popular in Doge memes like this one.  Most memes usually peak and die out, but some stick around. And here's the thing with Doge: it's Lindy. It's been around for an unusually long time. That gives it a higher probability of surviving even longer.  As the meme expands and its utility as a cryptocurrency is actualized, Dogecoin will grow in popularity and value. Although currently floating around four cents, it could eventually reach a dollar. Dogecoin to a dollar has become a part of the meme. #DogecoinToADollar, which has recently been trending on twitter, may be a prophesy of what's to come.  2. Dogecoin has strong and unique branding  Branding is important. It influences our purchasing decisions and our sentiment towards products, services, and ideas. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies, so branding matters for public adoption. Bitcoin is at the forefront of the cryptocurrency revolution because of its strong and unique branding.  For Bitcoin to act as its intended purpose as the reserve currency of the world, it cannot be beholden to any state, country, or individual. Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, fortified the integrity of the Bitcoin system by remaining anonymous and never cashing out his early coffers. This, along with its originality and resilience, gives Bitcoin a strong brand foundation.  Similar to Bitcoin, Dogecoin also has strong and unique branding. Dogecoin is symbolized by the Shiba Inu dog meme. Its logo is a cute dog. Other cryptocurrencies don't have a logo as memorable or funny. It's ironic for something so silly like a dog-meme to be associated with such a serious financial asset. It makes a mockery of traditional cryptocurrency networks. Plus, who doesn't love dogs?  Dogecoin's logo is symbolized by its official mascot, a Shiba Inu dog  Propelling the Dogecoin zeal is Elon Musk, who regularly tweets about the coin and previously touted himself as the former CEO of Dogecoin. Decentralized ideas are often helmed by an unofficial but bonafide leader. Satoshi Nakamoto for Bitcoin, u/DeepFuckingValue for GameStop, and now Elon Musk for Dogecoin.  With influential individuals like Elon Musk leading the Dogecoin choir, the cryptocurrency stands to gain from its growing brand popularity as hoards of young people share #DogecoinArmy, #DogecoinToTheMoon, and #DogeToADollar, spreading the meme mania on Reddit, TikTok, and Twitter.  Elon Musk shared this Doge meme on January 28th, 2021 on his Twitter, causing Dogecoin to surge 300%  3. Dogecoin is an anti-establishment movement. This fuels growth.  The GameStop short squeeze has shown us that people are fed up with the financial establishment. Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is a movement away from centralization, and Dogecoin has a role to play in this revolution. Uniting behind a cause like Dogecoin allows regular folks to have a say in what they perceive as valuable. The future is digital and decentralized, and Dogecoin is contributing to this anti-establishment narrative."}, {"upvote": 80, "content": "No. Not any time soon. I'll explain in a point and try to get at the motivation for this question in another.  #1 Why Doge Won't Go to $20  Right now, $DOGE is trading at around $.6 a coin. If you take that and multiply it by the total number of coins in existence, you get to its market capitalization, which is $79 billion (roughly).  If $DOGE were to go to $20, then its market cap would be $2.6 trillion. That's 2.6x Bitcoin's market cap.  That would make it more valuable than the most valuable company in the world, Saudi Aramco (at $2.5 trillion) and Apple (at $2.4 trillion).  Just no. Not going to happen. Certainly not in the next 12 months and not likely in the next 5 years.  #2 The Motivation For This Question  The motivation for this question is simple: if $DOGE were to go to $20, then it would do a little better than 33x.  So, I assume the questioner wants to know whether $DOGE can do at least 30x. The answer is no.  You are too late to this pump. Get over it and choose another one.  There are so many other cryptos out there that could do this\\u2014but you have to go outside the top 10 coins. You'll have to look at those in the 110 - 75 range (ranked by market cap).  My two favorite at or outside the top 100, because they are related to broader ecosystems are:  1. Voyager Token ($VGX) [ https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/voyager-token/ ], which is used for the Voyager Exchange. This exchange is available in the US and actually doesn't rip people off for their trades like Coinbase. It also lets you get interest 10% on your tokens right there (v. Coinbase's top yield of 2%). 2. Flow ($FLOW) [ https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/flow/ ], which is a layer 1 scalable blockchain by the developers of CryptoKitties and TopShot. Will it really beat $ETH? That's unlikely, but it could find a niche space and pump 10x. Ok, so there you go. The above statements are not recommendations for any of these, since the whole space is crazy right now. I just wanted to give you a sense of what it takes to pump even 10x.  The top 100 coins all have a market cap above $1 billion right now! So, those large gains are harder to find.

With a circulating supply of 129 Billion DOGE at present, a price of $1,000 per unit would give Dogecoin a market cap of 129 TRILLION USD.  All money in circulation on planet earth is thought to be around 37 trillion USD in total, so that means Dogecoin would have 4X the value of all money in circulation on planet earth.  Since all money, including assets in the forms of investments, derivatives, and cryptocurrencies is said to exceed $1.2 quadrillion USD, Dogecoin's marketcap would account for approximately 10% of this total value.

Dogecoin faces these challenges to a much greater degree than many of its rivals.  Secondly, Built-in-dilution.  Unlike bitcoin, which has built-in scarcity with a finite supply of 21 million coins, Dogecoin is inflationary. There are currently 132 billion units in circulation, according to data from Cryptocurrency Prices, Charts And Market Capitalizations | CoinMarketCap.  And that number will expand by 5 billion annually forever. This dilution makes Dogecoin unsuitable as a long-term store of value, because the more coins in circulation, the less each is worth.

After rising from about $0.0002 to more than $0.70 in a matter of months, many people have found themselves asking the question How high will Dogecoin go?  Many people investing in cryptocurrency for the first time appear curious about DOGE [ https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/what-is-dogecoin/ ] and other altcoins. Even though the DOGE price crashed more than 70% all the way down to $0.20 before recovering somewhat, Dogecoin still finds itself among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap.  But will this always be the case? Can Dogecoin reach $1? What about $10 or even $100 or more?  There are several reasons the odds are against DOGE climbing too much higher. Valuations like $1 or even $10 are theoretically possible. But a price target of $100 or more, isn't realistic for DOGE, given the way the coin works.  While it's impossible to predict the future when it comes to the price of DOGE or any other investment, we can make a reasonable hypothesis as to whether DOGE will ever reach $100."}, {"upvote": 38, "content": "Simple supply and demand. If more people want to buy the currency than sell it, the price goes up, but if more people want to sell than buy the price goes down.  The obvious thing which affects this is the balance of trade - the difference between imports and exports in and out of the economic area using the currency. If US imports are greater than US exports, the demand for dollars goes down because foreign countries are earning dollars but aren't spending them on US products. This reduces the value of dollars, making US goods cheaper for foreign buyers whilst simultaneously making it more expensive for US citizens to buy imports. Over time, this should help balance the trade gap.  Of course, it's more complicated than this and it is not just goods being imported and exported which affect the demand for currency. Risk-averse international investors will generally seek to put their money in stable countries with attractive interest rates offering a decent return. Therefore, perceptions of political and economic stability and/or high interest rates will tend to increase the value of a currency. Currencies of countries with weak, debt-ridden or failing governments will fall in value.  Currency value is also affected by the activities of the central bank who issue it. If they issue more currency, this will have the effect of inflating it and suppressing its value. The policy of quantitative easing pursued by some governments in the wake of the 2008 crisis has the same effect.  Finally, governments and central banks (and sometimes speculators) will attempt to deliberately manipulate currency values by making large trades on the international markets. During the Euro crisis in 2010, the value of the Swiss Franc reached record levels against other Western currencies as it was perceived as one of the only remaining safe havens. This threatened to make Swiss exports prohibitively expensive and the Swiss National Bank responded by buying large amounts of foreign currency in an attempt to reduce the value of the Franc."}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "Great question.

Recently, Dogecoin, which has been in the ascendant, plummeted by nearly 40% and its price was nearly cut off, which aroused public concern.  What's more unexpected is that this matter actually originated from a show in which billionaire Elon Musk participated.  On May 8, local time, Tesla CEO Musk participated in hosting the old American entertainment variety show \\\"Saturday Live\\\". During the show, Musk called himself the Godfather of Dogecoin (Dogefather), which is the future of cryptocurrency, an unstoppable financial instrument and will take over the world.  He also added that dogcoins are as real as dollar bills. But after repeated questions from the host, Musk was \\\"forced\\\" to admit that dogcoin was a \\\"hustle\\\". Subsequently, the price of dogcoin plummeted.  It is not difficult to observe the price trend of dogcoin carefully and find that dogcoin, which is considered an \\\"aircoin\\\" by many \\\"coin enthusiasts\\\", has always been closely related to Musk's public statements, although it has gone up and down. The dog coin has become a spokesman for Musk.  This also makes some netizens suspect that dogcoin has become Musk's image stock - support Musk, just buy dogcoin?  The dogcoin is deeply bound to Musk  The connection between Musk and dogcoin goes back to 2019 at the earliest.  In April 2019, the dogcoin community had launched a campaign to select the CEO of dogcoin, and Musk got the first vote. At the time, he had changed his Twitter title to Dogcoin CEO, though it was quickly deleted.  More than a year later, Musk again sent four tweets in a row on December 20, 2020, referring to cryptocurrencies and expressing his interest in Bitcoin. The price of dogcoin rose from $0.0039 to $0.0046 that day.  In the famous \\\"leek\\\" vs. \\\"institution\\\" GME event earlier in the year, WSB (a forum called \\\"Wall Street Gamblers\\\") made dogcoin popular again, soaring nearly 10 times in one day to rank seventh in market cap. The WSB (a forum called \\\"Wall Street Gamblers\\\") was also a hit, soaring nearly 10 times in one day to rank seventh in market cap.  On February 8, 2021, Musk continued to boost Dogcoin with 3 consecutive tweets, and Tesla announced the purchase of $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. Dogcoin fluctuates dramatically at high levels, the price stays at a high of $0.08 and bitcoin rises from $38,000 to $46,000 in one fell swoop.  On February 24, 2021, Maska changed his Twitter profile to \\\"Doge all day, Doge all night\\\" and Dogcoin rose over 24% in 24 hours.  ......  Searching with the keyword \\\"dogcoin\\\", Musk has tweeted about dogcoin nearly 30 times in 5 months from last December to now. In addition, he also tweeted frequently about bitcoin and ethereum-related information.  As a result, there are also some bullish Tesla users who claim that Musk has gradually evolved into an avid seeker of cryptocurrency.  Musk has publicly expressed his support for dogcoin so often that it is widely believed that \\\"Musk and dogcoin\\\" are firmly bound and inseparable.  So much so that every time Musk publicly declares his support for Dogcoin, the value of Dogcoin increases - as soon as Musk publicly expresses his support for Dogcoin, Dogcoin rises in response.  Currently, the most talked about topic on major US self-publishing platforms is dogcoin. Topics about coin speculation, apps and other hot topics are ranked in the front, and Musk's influence is also visible.  So the question arises, why does Musk frequently shout dogcoin on social media platforms? What is Musk's intention to tie himself to dogcoin?  Dogcoin is just a symbol of \\\"cutting leeks  It is necessary to popularize the origin of dogcoin.  It was first invented and launched by two engineers in December 2013, and became popular in the online world because it used the magic brainwashing emoji \\\"Doge\\\" as its logo. It was originally invented to mock the cryptocurrency that parodied Bitcoin.  Because of its strong cultural ties to the Reddit community, Dogcoin later became the official reward coin of the foreign grassroots community Reddit, which at the time served only as a \\\"tip currency\\\".  However, while Musk publicly supported dogcoin and pushed it up, dogcoin was also considered an \\\"aircoin\\\" without any value by a large number of \\\"coin enthusiasts\\\".  If you know the history of dogcoin, you can see that although it is a cryptocurrency with the popular Bitcoin, Bitcoin has a cap of 21 million coins, while dogcoin is born on the basis of the code of Bitcoin, with almost no technical innovation, 21 million coins were mined in the first year, and 5 billion coins were issued every year after that, with no cap.  Notice the phrase, \\\"no cap\\\". No cap determines that dogcoins can be issued indefinitely and can attract maximum investor participation, what does this mean? -- theoretically, there can be countless people in the game and the dealer can earn infinitely more.  Although all factors indicate that dogcoin has no \\\"value support\\\", dogcoin also has advantages that other cryptocurrencies do not have, such as the fact that basically all exchanges have dogcoin and have a certain level of popularity. For example, dogcoin is available on basically all exchanges and has a certain level of popularity. If you want to use it to \\\"cut leeks\\\", it is the best target.  Some netizens commented: Bitcoin is up, the powerful one is the coin; dogcoin is up, the powerful one is Musk.  Before Musk publicly announced his support for dogcoin, the trading volume of dogcoin was extremely low, and there were no large institutions to buy dogcoin explicitly to back it. As a direct result, dogcoin has become Musk's personal IP endorsement tool.  By endorsing dogcoin, Musk has thus completed \\\"fame\\\" and \\\"profit\\\". He even said that he wanted to take the dogcoin to the moon through the starship, and his satisfaction was overwhelming.  Both the dog coin and the \\\"Shiba Inu coin\\\" that Musk shouted, I am afraid that in the end, they are his \\\"temporary ATM\\\". Many people who follow Musk's coin speculation and fantasize about getting rich overnight may end up becoming \\\"daydreamers\\\" who have been \\\"leek cut\\\".  There is no doubt that many cryptocurrencies, including dogcoin, are just a bunch of bubbles and have no value.  Their so-called \\\"value\\\" is only based on the consensus of investors that they will \\\"continue to rise\\\", and once the bubble is burst, investors will eventually realize that the \\\"cryptocurrency world\\\" is just a \\\"scam\\\". Once the bubble is burst, investors will eventually realize that the \\\"cryptocurrency world\\\" is just a \\\"scam\\\"."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "Dogecoin has UNLIMITED SUPPLY.

Look, early crypto adoption is low risk, high reward potential. It's entirely possible to be in the red for a long time if you buy at a peak.

If you bought Bitcoin at anything under $40k, you're in the money.  Say you compare it to a traditional investment like blue chip stocks. You can expect perhaps 10% gain per year, in order to see $1000 gain in a year you have to invest 10k.  Whereas, if you invested $55.0 in Dogecoin at any time before December 2020, you would be sitting on the same $1000 (or more, depending on exactly when). In less than a year.  There were no guarantees, and I didn't personally think that Dogecoin was going to do anything ever, I just wanted the novelty of having it.  Say you bought at the peak, $0.74, 1000 Dogecoins. Worst case scenario you're out $740 for a while. But you still own the Dogecoins. I wouldn't really call 1000 Dogecoins an investment, but if you keep at it and average in, your cost basis will come down and depending on what happens with the coin in the future, it may turn into the most valuable investment.

My biggest pet peeve about people's understanding of bitcoin is that they think of it only as money.. this keeps people from appreciating the bigger picture: bitcoin is the unit of account for a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, everybody can patch into that system and use it for whatever purpose they want. To date, that's mostly buying and selling it. Within the next year or two, far beyond, Scoff if you want. In the past year or so, ventures like Sovryn, Lightning Network, OpenNode, and RSK built the foundations for scalable payment and financial rails on bitcoin's blockchain\\u2026 soon sidechains, smart contracts, and settlement platforms will use bitcoin as a permissionless settlement protocol for all sorts of transactions, it's a matter of time\\u2026 Rome wasn't built in a day, people only started thinking about bitcoin this way for about five years, once it dawned on them that bitcoin could do more than go up and short the bankers. You can't expect to change the world in five years. Even Facebook took almost a decade to reach the Fortune 500. If bitcoin weren't bitcoin, nobody would care about the pace of its development. Technological advances always result from years and decades of iteration and experimentation. Microchips, jet engines, steel construction beams, electricity, and all other common inventions took a long time to fulfill their potential\\u2026 the difference is, you can't hang a price on those technologies. You can't break those concepts into small units and exchange them for more of your government's money. There's no way to go long on a jet engine but you can do all that with bitcoin. It's natural to talk about bitcoin's price and how to trade it, but that obscures a fundamental truth that it's not bitcoin that gives this electronic cash system its value. It's the system that gives bitcoin its value. Eventually, this system will serve as a global settlement layer for all sorts of transactions. When you exchange things, you will use a product or service built on bitcoin's public, open, permissionless blockchain.. an app or API will convert all payments into your local currency instantly, for a fraction of Visa's service fee. As Elon Musk says, it's inevitable. Few people will hold actual bitcoin in any quantity\\u2026 they will continue to use local currencies, with APIs and merchant services converting their money in and out of bitcoin on demand. A few altcoins will play key roles in the financial networks of the future. A few altcoins will play key roles in the financial networks of the future\\u2026 you won't think about them as investments, just things you use to get what you want. E.g., you'll buy a little basic attention token (BAT) when you want to publish an ad.. you won't expect to get rich, you just want to make sure a real person sees your ad. In time, many altcoins will migrate to a bitcoin sidechain, but some will persist. Not only will they have loyal users and large networks, but they will offer something distinct and essential. People will not want to give them up without a compelling reason to switch to something else. People love convenient, familiar experiences that we can share with others. So, maybe BAT will serve as the de facto currency for the internet while bitcoin does everything else, simply because that's what people get used to. This will happen whether or not you make money from selling your crypto for more than you bought it for.. In fact, your need to get rich quick may keep you from appreciating the revolution unfolding before our very eyes. New projects created are challenging our beliefs of economics.. privacy, commerce, and monetary policy. Developers and entrepreneurs are building entire financial systems build de novo from laptops and discord channels, released at a global scale and accessible to anybody with an internet connection. For example, look at Yearn Finance. Its token, YFI, was created only to transfer value into other assets. Speculators buy YFI tokens expecting YFI's price to go up. This subsidizes rewards for users and developers.. that's great as long as the price of the token goes up. What happens when it doesn't? How long do you think investors will stick around? Perhaps the value lies beyond the token. Towards the end of last year, Yearn Finance started merging with other projects \\u2014 decentralized financial protocols, swapping platforms, borrowing/lending services, developer communities, liquidity providers, and thought leaders who contribute to the growth and development of YFI's ecosystem. As a result, YFI tokens don't need a way to capture value. If Yearn Finance grows into the best DeFi platform on earth, people will need YFI tokens. Like season tickets to your favorite sports team, YFI will be the cost of admission. Time will tell whether these mergers will enhance the value of YFI or its ecosystem. Some of those merged projects are really strong, but others have flaws in their smart contracts (and one of them basically died after 90% of its users pulled their funds off of its platform). Developers plan to fix all of these problems. Let's assume they do.. what sort of contagion could spread from faulty smart contracts or hidden attack vectors? What about collusion among participants? Can one component steal from another? How will the market set a price for the new governance structures? Will these combinations create synergies or spillovers among projects, or cannibalize each others' users? Will the mergers make these networks more resilient and secure, or less? We shall see and i can't wait to see how it turns out.. in a year or two, you'll feel silly that you ever worried about a $36,000 bitcoin and you may even get mad that you took profits at that price. Likewise for a $36,000 YFI token and in a decade, you may feel silly about thinking YFI would serve as a global financial platform at all, instead of some other technology built on bitcoin's blockchain. At this moment, you probably don't care. Bitcoin's price dropped 7% today and that awesome new altcoin didn't go up as much as the other one your friend bought last week. Would you rather get upset that your altcoin went up only 20% in a month or marvel that you have a ringside seat for the development of new financial networks, play a small part in their growth, and see the value of your investment grow many times over? Over time, some of these new financial networks will capture enormous value and the price of their tokens will explode. The only question is which ones will win and which will lose.. bitcoin will gradually subsume almost all of them. Some people want to get rich.. others want to create a better future for themselves and everybody around them.

Tom and I started our first jobs out of college at the same time, he was in my analyst class at Lehman Brothers.  All analysts at the time were given the same compensation package to relocate from around the world and live in New York City, one of the most expensive places in the world. Our base salary was US$55k and they even gave us a one time relocation bonus of US$10k.  It was all the money in the world to me.  I had no clue how expensive New York City actually was, and how you get taxed at the Federal, State and City level\\u2026  I also had no clue that I would virtually be living paycheck to paycheck off of that amount of money (which far exceeded the national average at the time) due to my lifestyle choices (I had to live in Manhattan, of course\\u2026).  But quite frankly it didn't matter. I had made it. Gotten a seat at the coveted poker table called Wall Street. And it was the only way I could foresee myself becoming a millionaire.  So I packed up and moved up to New York City and met Tom.  Tom was from the West Coast and was very laid back. He was originally Chinese, but he was not like the rest of us, bright eyed and bushy tailed and eager to learn about the inner workings of Wall Street.  Tom seemed out of place from the get go with his laid back demeanor and chill West Coast attitude\\u2026  Nearly every night as fresh analysts on Wall Street, we had some sort of activity, whether it was training program related (organized by the company) or just a group of us hot shot new analysts who wanted to go out and explore the city.  Tom rarely joined us for these events. Unless of course it was mandatory, at which point he left just as soon as it was over.  Over the course of the next year I befriended Tom and got to know him a little bit better. The more I got to know him, the more I realized the difference between him and many of the others in our class\\u2026he was frugal.  Super frugal.  He told me he never really cared to come to Wall Street but he just wanted to make some money and then go back to the West Coast and retire. He didn't need much he just wanted a comfortable living, which is why he rarely spent money. He lived over in Brooklyn since the rent was half the price as Manhattan. But Tom didn't mind the 35 minute commute on the subway because he wanted to save money.  After our two year analyst program in New York, many people in my class got promoted to associate and stayed on in NY. Some left to competing firms, and still others left the business all together.  I caught up with Tom and asked him what his plan was. After prodding and prying for a while Tom finally told me that between his salary and bonuses etc he had saved up nearly $60k USD over the last 2 years and once he got to $100k he was out and would move back to the West Coast and figure out the next step. Wall Street wasn't for him and he just wanted to jump start his retirement plan.  I was in shock when I heard this. Here I was living the high life of a slick city banker (read dbag) and after 2 years on Wall Street do you want to know what my savings was?  -$3700.00. Yes negative.  Not only had I spent everything I earned, I actually racked up credit card debt somehow. I had lived a life of excess and had nothing but higher cholesterol and weight gain to show for it. My YOLO attitude had backtracked me from the very reason I moved up to Wall Street to begin with\\u2026to build wealth.  I felt sick to my stomach after speaking to Tom and vowed to turn things around.  I lost touch with Tom over the years\\u2026I wish I hadn't. I'm not sure if he became a millionaire before 30 or not. But what I do know is that he was a hell of a lot farther along than I was after our first 2 years of work. He realized he had an opportunity to change his life and never took his eye off the ball.

While the creators of other cryptocurrencies and payment systems try to surprise and attract potential users with certain technological moves and innovative solutions, Dogecoin gained popularity in a completely different way. The developers used an image of a Japanese Shiba Inu dog as Dogecoin's symbol, a meme that flooded the Internet.  The creators' main goal was to amuse the crypto community in a sense. Nevertheless, Dogecoin quickly gained popularity and significantly increased in value, becoming one of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market.

Click for litecoin to bitcoin [ https://exchanger24.org/xchange_ltc_to_btc/ ] Exchange  What is Dogecoin (DOGE)?  Dogecoin (DOGE) is a decentralised, peer-to-peer, open-source cryptocurrency derived from the Litecoin blockchain. Like most cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin is based on blockchain technology and functions on cryptographic principles using a proof-of-work algorithm. When a new block is formed in the chain, two cryptographic keys are created: a public and a private key. The public key allows users to view information about the block, while the private key provides access to the owner of the formed block.  Dogecoin is also a mineable digital currency. If you're looking for the best cryptocurrency to mine in 2020, please read our blog.  Dogecoin's block production rate is 6 minutes. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, that's pretty fast, making Dogecoin a great tool for payments and money transfers.  Dogecoin's pros and cons  Among its pros, Dogecoin is a much better means of payment than, for example, Bitcoin, even though Bitcoin's main purpose is to be a payment method. Dogecoin is also a great way to make payments online. Other advantages that set Dogecoin apart from other cryptocurrencies include the following:   * Dogecoin perfectly fits investors who don't have enough capital to invest in more expensive cryptocurrencies. It allows newcomers to get to know the cryptocurrency market and gain necessary experience.  * Dogecoin allows fast, cheap transactions.  * It has a very active community. The cryptocurrency originally conceived as a joke has functioned since 2013 and is gradually gaining popularity. It sees stable, albeit slow, growth, and even counts Elon Musk among its fans.  * Dogecoin ranks among top 50 cryptocurrencies in market capitalisation, which suggests its high stability and trust.  * There are no problems with scaling, unlike most other cryptocurrencies.  * DOGE's transaction speed is very high and has extremely low commission rates.  * Many exchanges and online platforms support Dogecoin. Dogecoin (DOGE) price prediction for 2020, 2021, 2025, 2030  Dogecoin has experienced both ups and downs at different times. The cryptocurrency does not boast many unique qualities, elements or technological solutions, and its last update took place back in 2015. Despite that, this cryptocurrency performs well and has a very welcoming and vibrant community, with Elon Musk as a top supporter. Given that the cryptocurrency market constantly sees an influx of new participants, newcomers' interest in Dogecoin is unlikely to wane. Let's look to the future and analyse the probable scenarios of Dogecoin's mid-term and long-term price prediction from cryptocurrency experts for 2020, 2021, 2025 and 2030.  Trading Beasts Dogecoin (DOGE) price prediction for 2020, 2021, 2023, 2025, 2030  Per Trading Beasts' DOGE price prediction, Dogecoin's price will rise in the coming years.

For 2022, they expect the trading range to expand to $0.0043\\u20130.007.

When Dogecoin was forked from the Bitcoin chain, its creator removed that limit so there will be an infinite number of coins being minted (currently 132 billions). This means that it will dilute more and more with time. Of course, coins will be lost, but it is not as drastic as the scarcity of Bitcoin driving the price up. So there are current 10,000x more Dogecoin in circulation than Bitcoins, it is only logical that Dogecoin is at least 10,000 times smaller.  Also, if you look at the market cap for Bitcoin and Dogecoin, Bitcoin is currently at 1 trillion, while Dogecoin is at 28 billions. this means that if Dogecoin would go 30x to 6$-7$, it would equalize the Bitcoin marketcap, which is not logical (at least to me), but its value would line up with Bitcoin in respect to the number of coins in circulation.  So, IMHO, Dogecoin would become the equal of Bitcoin at around 6$-7$, but that is today. Tomorrow everything will be moving up as more and more people accept the cryptos as a commodity.

Elon Musk also openly endorsed the coin in July 2020, which resulted in a 14% price hike. See more popular opinions on Dogecoin.

In my experience, the people that will give you advice, especially in crypto, are trying to sell you their bags or some other nonsense that won't help you or your financial circumstance. There are rare occurrences, of course, but it's best to do your own research and make your own decisions.  In the case of DOGE, it is one of (if not the original) meme coins which mean they basically have no value in terms of use case (utility) or financial mechanism that provides some product or service of benefit. Instead, it's just a meme [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme ]. I think the best indicator of DOGE in the macro is that it dumped during what everyone generally believed would be a pump: Elon Musk shilling it on SNL.  DOGE is a fork of Litecoin which is a fork of Bitcoin. DOGE is highly inflationary without any controls in place to mitigate its inflation characteristic. The only thing that will make the price pump is high demand for the token which, on some level, has to mathematically outpace the inflation which grows at a rate of 10,000 tokens for every block mined. It generally takes one minute to mine a block which means every minute, 10,000 more tokens are added to the circulating supply. While the decreasing rate of inflation (in the graph below) seems to taper, which in some sense means that this issue should correct itself over time which as you can see in the graph, that's going to require A LOT of time.  The real problem is the lack of developer support, generally speaking. Litecoin is sometimes referred to (depending on what group says it) as the test net for Bitcoin meaning that the protocol tests out changes/upgrades to the protocol. Dogecoin doesn't have this (take a look at the GitHub to see the level of developer activity).  The final nail in the coffin with DOGE is that there are roughly 3,287,164 wallets [ https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-dogecoin-addresses.html ] at the time of writing this and 73 hold over $10mil worth of DOGE, 600 hold over $1mil, and 3,346 hold over $100k.

Granted the rate of inflation is not strictly controlled like the US dollar, but part of what keeps Dogecoin low is that it was decided to eliminate reward halving after one or two halving cycles and allow the subsidy to be claimed indefinitely.

Those \\u2018benefits' make it an ideal candidate to be used as a way to carry value between exchanges for arbitrage purposes and I firmly believe this is one of its foremost uses and the reason why it has been able to stay in the top with all the other big name coins despite it being a joke ^^  From an investment standpoint, Dogecoin has exploded before. As cryptocurrencies mature, the prices will become less and less volatile and this being one of the least volatile coins as it is it's unlikely it will go to the moon. However, if you look at the Dogecoin price on any given exchange over a few days time period, there's a very distinct pattern to it, an almost sinusoidal oscillation. If you are a patient person I bet that oscillation could be taken advantage of and produce gain in a more reliable way than waiting for a coin to explode one day."}, {"upvote": 7, "content": "Every dog has its day, and Dogecoin has had its.  This cryptocurrency started as a joke, but entered the market so early that even a joke coin attracted followers.  Of course, those who own the coin, or trade it, are very interested in seeing the running joke continue.  Others who feel that the decentralized nature of blockchain technology holds real economic promise are very interested in seeing the market mature and Dogecoin fall to a footnote in history.

These other altcoins apart from top 30 are going up & down depending upon how these top 30 are priced or to someextent you can say how Bitcoin is performing . For example if people who have invested in Bitcoin , Ethereum ,Ripple etc when they get too much profit then they start investing in low priced altcoins and it make these coins price rise suddenly. If Dogecoin really come up with the solutions of the problems(Dogecoin is a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency that enables you to easily send money online. Think of it as \\\"the internet currency.\\\") then it will also come under top currency list.  But I would still say that the entire Crypto marked is still derived by Bitcoin, so if Bitcoin goes up then other currencies also go up which should never be like this.A currency's potential should get this on the top not the other way around.

All money in circulation on planet earth is thought to be around 37 trillion USD in total, so that means Dogecoin would have 4X the value of all money in circulation on planet earth.  Since all money, including assets in the forms of investments, derivatives, and cryptocurrencies is said to exceed $1.2 quadrillion USD, Dogecoin's marketcap would account for approximately 10% of this total value.

If we see a big bull market and Elon Musk really gets serious about developing DOGE further, we can potentially see Dogecoin go up to $5 in this bull run.  Have a look at the unique fundamentals of DOGE in my other post. [ https://www.quora.com/How-good-is-Dogecoin-in-cryptocurrency/answer/Marius-Kramer ]"}, {"upvote": 58, "content": "The price like anything is determined by supply and demand.  The supply at any given time is a factor of those who are mining DOGE coin mostly with state of the art computers, fast internet connection, and cheap or Free electricity, and those who already own DOGE and decide to sell it.  The demand is determined by those who want to buy DOGE and that is people who have been convinced by tweets from famous people like Elon Musk and Mark Cuban who sometimes do a one word tweet, DOGE and it creates a lot of demand. Other times in an interview Musk might make a comment about how he likes DOGE.  Now think just a bit about those who are buying, (the demand side of the equation) and those who are selling, (the supply side).  The supply has two types of people. Those who own DOGE already because they mined it in the past or bought mostly at a lower price than the current price, and those who are mining DOGE currently. Musk and Cuban, both very rich, have access to big state of the art computers and probably buy electricity cheaper than the average person. The supply of DOGE they have is probably from mining the coin at this advantage over other miners.  Now this is pure speculation on my part, I only suspect that Musk and Cuban mine DOGE. They may not. Or they may do it indirectly through a Hedge fund or other investment vehicle. But of course if they are mining it, Musk and Cuban like DOGE.  The mining reward for each block of transactions is 10,000 DOGE. They are at an advantage if they mine it, for winning the reward since they have the best equipment at their disposal. BTC mining reward is now 6.25 BTC, and even at the start was only 50 BTC.  There is no device in the programing of DOGE coin that halves the mining rate. This is what is unique about BTC and LTC, and DGB, and nearly every legitimate Crypto currency as it is hard wired into their code. It causes there to be dwindling supply over time, and this supply shock tends to drive the price up over time.  But with DOGE, because there is no halving of the mining reward DOGE has no supply shock over time. So the long term prospects for the price is due wholly on the demand that famous people like Musk and Cuban can create by making positive comments about DOGE.  Where BTC and legitimate cryptos rise due to both Dwindling supply, an ultimate hard cap on total supply as well as increasing demand, utilizing both sides of the supply and demand equation, DOGE has no Dwindling supply, No Ultimate hard cap, so there is no limit to the supply side of the equation. And it is unlikely that Musk will be able to continue to increase demand by his comments.  DOGE will eventually have a sustainability crisis.  Eventually all the people who follow Musk and are mentally shallow enough to be convinced to buy DOGE will have already bought it. At that point there will be no one else to buy at a higher price, thus the price will start crashing.  Crashes in price happen with legitimate cryptos like BTC as well but because the fundamentals are much better, (Hard caps, real world use cases, and mining reward halving) for the good cryptos, the prices are higher and more sustainable and as the long term charts show, the good crypto's follow a 4 year cycle because the mining reward supply shock is on a 4 year cycle.  Bottom line is this. Don't be a sucker. Don't buy crypto's that have no use case, were created as a joke, can be created to infinity, have poor fundamentals, and no dwindling supply built in. This is exactly what DOGE is. It's a fools coin.  Yes it might rise in price a while longer. Nearly all crypto's rise when BTC is in a bull market like it is right now. But bull markets don't last forever. Musk and Cuban's credibility on DOGE won't last forever either.  BTW. This is not financial advice.

Powered by meme virality, unique branding, and its eventual utility as a currency, Dogecoin is a perfect storm that is poised to soar. Let me explain.  These days, there are a lot of legitimate offers online that gives great advantage to cryptocurrency investors where they get good returns of their invested cryptocurrency on platforms like CryptoFXnetwork Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www . cryptofxnetwork . com). These are opportunities that need to be really utilized to its maximum.  On the date of publication, Steph Brooks did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.  Steph Brooks, CFA, is a registered investment advisor on a mission to bring simplicity to the world of investing.  1. Dogecoin is a Meme. That gives it power.  Memes are ideas, they are decentralized inside-jokes. Their hive mind virality spreads like wildfire in the cultural zeitgeist. Like a virus, memes mutate and adapt, blending with other memes to appropriate trends. Their parabolic growth is expedited due to the inter-connectedness of our social media world.  Like the GameStop phenomenon, Dogecoin is fueled by memes, fervor, and a decentralized community of retail investors. The GameStop short squeeze was propelled by viral memes in the WallStreetBets Reddit community. Memes like we like the stock! and diamond hands lit a fire under the movement, with jokes about tendies, stonks, and degenerate trading fueling the blaze. Doge is a meme, and as we've seen, memes take on a life of their own. They are not to be underestimated.  Words like much, wow, and many are popular in Doge memes like this one.  Most memes usually peak and die out, but some stick around. And here's the thing with Doge: it's Lindy. It's been around for an unusually long time. That gives it a higher probability of surviving even longer.  As the meme expands and its utility as a cryptocurrency is actualized, Dogecoin will grow in popularity and value. Although currently floating around four cents, it could eventually reach a dollar. Dogecoin to a dollar has become a part of the meme. #DogecoinToADollar, which has recently been trending on twitter, may be a prophesy of what's to come.  2. Dogecoin has strong and unique branding  Branding is important. It influences our purchasing decisions and our sentiment towards products, services, and ideas. There are thousands of cryptocurrencies, so branding matters for public adoption. Bitcoin is at the forefront of the cryptocurrency revolution because of its strong and unique branding.  For Bitcoin to act as its intended purpose as the reserve currency of the world, it cannot be beholden to any state, country, or individual. Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, fortified the integrity of the Bitcoin system by remaining anonymous and never cashing out his early coffers. This, along with its originality and resilience, gives Bitcoin a strong brand foundation.  Similar to Bitcoin, Dogecoin also has strong and unique branding. Dogecoin is symbolized by the Shiba Inu dog meme. Its logo is a cute dog. Other cryptocurrencies don't have a logo as memorable or funny. It's ironic for something so silly like a dog-meme to be associated with such a serious financial asset. It makes a mockery of traditional cryptocurrency networks. Plus, who doesn't love dogs?  Dogecoin's logo is symbolized by its official mascot, a Shiba Inu dog  Propelling the Dogecoin zeal is Elon Musk, who regularly tweets about the coin and previously touted himself as the former CEO of Dogecoin. Decentralized ideas are often helmed by an unofficial but bonafide leader. Satoshi Nakamoto for Bitcoin, u/DeepFuckingValue for GameStop, and now Elon Musk for Dogecoin.  With influential individuals like Elon Musk leading the Dogecoin choir, the cryptocurrency stands to gain from its growing brand popularity as hoards of young people share #DogecoinArmy, #DogecoinToTheMoon, and #DogeToADollar, spreading the meme mania on Reddit, TikTok, and Twitter.  Elon Musk shared this Doge meme on January 28th, 2021 on his Twitter, causing Dogecoin to surge 300%  3. Dogecoin is an anti-establishment movement. This fuels growth.  The GameStop short squeeze has shown us that people are fed up with the financial establishment. Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is a movement away from centralization, and Dogecoin has a role to play in this revolution. Uniting behind a cause like Dogecoin allows regular folks to have a say in what they perceive as valuable. The future is digital and decentralized, and Dogecoin is contributing to this anti-establishment narrative."}, {"upvote": 3, "content": "Dogecoin is cheap because it has no value.

It would merit you to either find a new way to purchase your niche items with dollars on Amazon, or realize that the only places where you can find such unique doge-wear is on a Doge-site and to pay with DogeCoin. Doge? I like Doge. I purposefully like using doge memes to piss off serious people. Its wicked pissah.  This kind of coin would need a basis to grow on; and right now, its' target base is dank memers. I'd like to believe it would grow on a bit-coin basis. There are many dank memer's on the internet.

Even grown adults may re-discover youth in a hilarious fashion, bosses pranking office workers with payments in the form of Dogecoin, friends gifting other friends Dogecoin, etc. All that would remain, after Dogecoin picks up speed, is for it to be bashed on by over-serious noobs on the news, like Matt Lauer, Amaka Ubaka, Fox News being a big one; because once they insult Dogecoin with inquiries on its' survivability in an open market, people will want to line up to stock up on the currency, just to defy their media outlets and their respective governments. Conspiracy theorists would bash their head off the wall, wondering if the thing that was driving up a Dogecoin price was a government entity. Honestly, we all have those suspicions that our governments just bribe the media to say what would keep people from buying something; Exhibit A: BitCoin. For all we know, governments would line up first as they may have before, because the only way to maintain control in a capitalist society thats ever-changing around them is to blindly line up for currencies such as these, in the far-fetched event that Pet stores start making Shibas purchaseable with Dogecoin, including but not limited to such examples. People might find it funny just to own a currency in the form of a DogeCoin. It might be even funnier when they're making oodles of cash off of people who only get into DogeCoin just to stay hip and current, and even moreso, just simple day-traders seeking new investment opportunities. It wouldn't take many people holding for the long, I'll tell you that. There are many variables that can come into play. I just have a feeling about this hilariously-named Cryptocurrency.

The joke crypto, the world's most valuable joke, the meme cryptocurrency: however you've heard Dogecoin described, it's recently shown that it's no laughing matter! DOGE was invented in 2013 by two software engineers called Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer. Just two years after the launch of Bitcoin, Markus and Palmer introduced Dogecoin as a \\u2018fun' and \\u2018friendly' alternative \\u2014 taking the famous meme dog \\u2018Doge' as their inspiration.  Although there is definitely a stark satirical element to DOGE, it's still a fully functioning cryptocurrency with its own online community. It was built on the Luckycoin protocol, which is itself built on the Litecoin platform. Like Bitcoin and other assets, Dogecoin users must mine the crypto before they can add it to their wallets. Unlike Bitcoin, however, there's an infinite supply of DOGE. (The number of Bitcoin tokens has been capped at 21 million).  In the eight years since its launch, Dogecoin has remained relatively separate from the wider cryptocurrency industry. This is partly because many \\u2018serious' crypto investors didn't believe the asset was worth their while. Until its recent growth, people who hold DOGE have mainly used it to tip online content creators, meaning its real-world use cases have been limited. However, it has also been used to raise funds for charitable causes. Most notably, the Dogecoin community raised more than $36,000 worth of DOGE to help the Jamaican bobsled team attend the Sochi Winter Olympics.  Despite its lighthearted origins, Dogecoin has attracted vocal supporters. Both Elon Musk and Snoop Dogg have previously promoted the asset to followers on Twitter, driving up interest in the true \\u2018underdog' of the crypto world.  Short-Term Dogecoin Price Predictions: 2021  What are crypto experts forecasting for DOGE in 2021?  After a record-breaking performance at the start of 2021, what do the top cryptocurrency analysts expect to see in the coming months? According to Digital Coin Price, the outlook is bright, with the asset set to achieve a new ATH before the end of the year.  Digital Coin Price's calculations suggest that Dogecoin will fluctuate between a yearly low of $0.82 and a yearly high of $1.75 in 2021.  Both of these values are higher than DOGE's current price of $0.350, but it wouldn't be unprecedented for the asset to reach these heights again.  According to BeinCrypto, Dogecoin reached a new ATH of $0.86 on 7th June. Although its price has since tumbled down, its recent jump could mean it's more likely that we'll see similar prices in the near future.  Digital Coin Price clearly thinks so. It's based its predictions on historical data and expects to see lower levels of volatility than we have done recently, with the price of Dogecoin staying consistently above $0.64. In terms of its price, this would make 2021 the asset's most successful year to date \\u2014 suggesting it could hold on to its new 4th-spot status.  Trading Beasts also seems optimistic about Dogecoin's future this year. Although its average predictions aren't quite as bright as those from Digital Coin Price, it never expects the asset to fall below its current price, even according to its minimum forecast.  Dogecoin Price Predictions for 2021:  MONTH  MINIMUM PRICE  MAXIMUM PRICE  April 2021  $0.20  $0.45  May 2021  $0.23  $0.77  June 2021  $0.26  $0.89  July 2021  $0.25  $0.61  August 2021  $0.27  $0.79  September 2021  $0.29  $0.62  October 2021  $0.35  $0.71  November 2021  $0.35  $0.92  December 2021  $0.36  $1.20  As we can see, Trading Beasts has predicted a potential yearly low of $0.23 in May 2021 and a potential yearly high of $0.77. This isn't as high as Digital Coin Price's maximum prediction ($0.88, which it expects to see in December 2021) it is good news for Dogecoin investors, more than double its current price.  Trading Beasts also predicts that we'll see relatively low levels of volatility. The biggest monthly percentage change is scheduled for December 2021, when the platform expects a change rate of 28.42%. This might sound significant, but compared to the recent volatility (back in 2020, the asset doubled in price in just a few days), this forecast is reasonably stable.  For the majority of the year, Wallet Investor apparently thinks the same. From its price prediction chart, it clearly believes that the price of Dogecoin will recover after its initial slump back down to $0.15, continuing to climb throughout the year.  This prediction is reassuring news for anyone who's wondering whether Dogecoin's bull run is over. From March onwards, the outlook is much brighter, with Wallet Investor expecting the price of DOGE to climb month-on-month throughout 2021.  By the end of December 2021, the platform has listed the following Dogecoin minimum, maximum, and average prices:   * Minimum: $0.44  * Maximum: $1.20  * Average: $0.726 None of these figures is sky-high, but they at least suggest that the value of Dogecoin won't crash and burn in the coming year. Its minimum price is lower than its current price, but not considerably \\u2014 suggesting that DOGE has left its pre-bull run prices behind (at least in the short term). What will happen to the price of Dogecoin in 2021?  According to the predictions, the price of Dogecoin is likely to increase in 2021. Although the forecasts vary when it comes to DOGE's yearly high, the consensus is that the asset's bull run isn't over yet. We could expect to see the value of DOGE increase to anything between $0.56 and $1.8.  Will the price of Dogecoin go up in 2021?  It seems likely that the price of Dogecoin will go up in 2021, potentially to $1.24 if Digital Coin Price is correct.  Additional Dogecoin price predictions for 2021 include:   * Previsioni Bitcoin: $0.8283  * Coin Price Forecast: $0.991  * Coinpedia: $1 So, is Dogecoin a good investment in 2021?  The short-term Dogecoin price predictions suggest Dogecoin asset could be a safe investment in 2021. None predicts that DOGE will close 2021 at a lower price than its current value, which should be a reassuring sign to investors.  Most investors do not know there are various platforms like cryptomax(www.cryptomax.tech) that aids the growth of bitcoin investment. This platform doubles your invested coin after 7 days. Try it and thank me latter.  Long-Term Dogecoin Price Predictions: 2022-2025  What are crypto experts forecasting for Dogecoin in 2022 and beyond?  Is Dogecoin's growth a fad? To work out whether DOGE is a good long-term investment, let's look ahead to some price predictions for 2022-2025. Digital Coin Price may have given one of the most optimistic forecasts for 2021, but how do its long-term predictions compare?  Digital Coin Price believes the future is bright for the price of DOGE. According to its analysis, the asset will continue to climb between 2022 and 2028 \\u2014 promising news to anyone who's wondering \\u2018what will Dogecoin be worth in 2030?'  Dogecoin Price Predictions for 2021-230   * 2021: $0.82  * 2022: $1.18  * 2023: $1.603  * 2024: $1.727  * 2025: $2.143  * 2026: $3.173  * 2027: $2.471  * 2028: $5.223  * 2029: $5.643  * 2030: $6.21 As investors debate \\u2018will Dogecoin reach $1?', Digital Coin Price clearly expects this milestone to be on the horizon. Its predictions show steady progress year-on-year, with a bearish adjustment in 2027 that apparently paves the way for significant growth in 2030.  Although the graph suggests that we'll see relatively high levels of volatility from 2022 onwards, it still shows an overwhelmingly bullish trend. This is a reassuring sign for anyone who's worried that Dogecoin's performance will start to stagnate.  In fact, the platform thinks the Dogecoin price will be $0.82 in 2021, rising to $1.18 by the end of 2022, $1.63 by the end of 2023, $2.127 by the end of 2024, and an impressive $3.143 by the end of 2025.  The Italian investment analysis site, Previsioni Bitcoin, is also optimistic about Dogecoin's long-term prospects. Its forecast places the price of DOGE at over $0.5 for the duration of 2022.  Previsioni Bitcoin has predicted a yearly low of $0.725 in January 2022 and a yearly high of $1.610 in May. Lots of analysts believe that $1 could prove a resistance point for DOGE, so it's encouraging to see that Previsioni Bitcoin, like Digital Coin Price, expects the asset to break through.  But although the platform expects DOGE to remain above $1, we can see a clear downward trend starting from June 2022. Could this mean that 2023 will signal a bearish trend? Maybe. Previsioni Bitcoin has predicted that DOGE will open the year at a value of $0.99, eventually falling back down to $0.72 by July. The good news is that the asset will start to recover from this point on, eventually closing the year at a respectable price of $1.133. However, this is a little disappointing when compared to its 2022 high.  For another long-term Dogecoin price prediction, we've turned to Coin Price Forecast. The platform has listed the following figures for the price of Dogecoin DOGE in 2022-2032:   * 2022: $0.440  * 2023: $0.471  * 2024: $0.593  * 2025: $0.508  * 2026: $0.704  * 2027: $0.833  * 2028: $0.833  * 2029: $0.808  * 2030: $0.947  * 2031: $1.134  * 2032: $1.338 As we can see, Coin Price Forecast is far more optimistic about Dogecoin's prospects. Forget $0.1 \\u2014 this platform believes DOGE will almost reach $1 in the run-up to 2030, eventually hitting $1.0381 by 2031.  As a long-term investment, Dogecoin's price could perform very well. According to its predictions, the value of the Dogecoin token could rise to $0.9 by the very end of 2021, rising to $1.20 in 2022, and achieving a mean price of $3.62 by 2025.  For 2025, it's predicted that Dogecoin will hit $1.5665 in the middle of the year, slumping a little to $0.5081 by December. However, this minor dip won't last long; 2026 will signal further growth, with the asset hitting an impressive $0.7 before the year is out.  In fact, The platform thinks the Dogecoin price will be $1.24 in 2021, rising to $2.44 by the end of 2022, $1.471 by the end of 2023, $2.593 by the end of 2024, and a remarkable $3.51 by the end of 2025."}, {"upvote": 71, "content": "Do not diversify away from Bitcoin more than 20%.

Investing is not a guaranteed way to make money, so make sure you know the risks and can afford to lose the money.  Cryptocurrencies are also highly volatile, so your cash can go down as well as up.  What is Dogecoin?  Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency which was launched in 2013.  Originally invented as a joke by software engineers Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus, the Dogecoin has the image of a Shuba Inu dog as its logo.  It has been marketed as the \\\"fun\\\" version of bitcoin.  Two weeks after its launch, the value of it jumped 300% after China banned banks from investing in cryptocurrencies, according to Investopedia.  Dogecoin then skyrocketed alongside other cryptos during the bubble that peaked in 2017, and it fell with the rest of them over 2018.Investing in cryptocurrencies can be an intriguing prospect for a portion of your portfolio, but you should make sure to diversify your investments with other holdings. Aside buying and holding cryptocurrency for potential gains which is a huge advantage of the benefits derived from cryptocurrency,as a cryptocurrency trade deciding on which crypto coin to choose from can be really difficult, I also recommend that you invest in service companies such as the Zippercoin(www.zippercoin.tech)company, a cryptocurrency investment company that gives return on investments made in days by capitalizing on the volatility of the crypto market to generate profits giving you better chance in the cryptocurrency market.  At its height, Dogecoin was trading for $0.018 per coin, according to crypto data firm CoinMarketCap.  Why is the value of it going up now?  At its height on Friday (January 29), Dogecoin was trading for $0.075 (5.5p) per coin, according to crypto data firm CoinMarketCap.  It jumped by a staggering 972% from $0.007 (less than 1p) the day before.  Later on Friday it started falling which continued into the weekend and then on Sunday it started going up again.  At the time of writing today (Monday February 1), Dogecoin is trading at $0.039 (2.8p), up by 41% over the last 24 hours but still below Friday's high.  The turbulence comes off the back of a bunch of Reddit threads calling for it to hit a value of $1 per coin.  Shares rocketed after an army of amateur traders targeted the games retailer, causing professional hedge funds who'd shorted it to lose billions.  But for the amateur traders, the surge saw them make some serious cash.  In simple terms, \\\"short selling\\\" is when professional investors borrow shares of stock to sell, and then buy them back at a lower price.  Essentially, they are betting that the stocks will drop in value so they can pocket the profit when they hand them back to the company they borrowed them from.  They rely on the company failing, which makes it a risky way of raising cash.  To prove a point, the Reddit community called WallStreetBets decided to take on the hedge fund by buying up GameStop stock as quickly as possible, driving up share prices.  But the hedge fund still needed to return the borrowed stock so it ended up buying back the shares at a hugely inflated price, costing them billions.  This made the price soar even more. The GameStop losses caused the hedge fund to go bust."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "I use to have a small amount on poloniex and it is still there can't say exactly how many though"}, {"upvote": 10, "content": "How much growth potential is there in Dogecoin?"}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-become-a-millionaire-with-Dogecoin-cryptocurrency", "question": "Is it possible to become a millionaire with Dogecoin cryptocurrency", "answers": [{"upvote": 1, "content": "Dogecoin can be termed as the first meme token introduced in the world of cryptocurrency.

Tom and I started our first jobs out of college at the same time, he was in my analyst class at Lehman Brothers.  All analysts at the time were given the same compensation package to relocate from around the world and live in New York City, one of the most expensive places in the world. Our base salary was US$55k and they even gave us a one time relocation bonus of US$10k.  It was all the money in the world to me.  I had no clue how expensive New York City actually was, and how you get taxed at the Federal, State and City level\\u2026  I also had no clue that I would virtually be living paycheck to paycheck off of that amount of money (which far exceeded the national average at the time) due to my lifestyle choices (I had to live in Manhattan, of course\\u2026).  But quite frankly it didn't matter. I had made it. Gotten a seat at the coveted poker table called Wall Street. And it was the only way I could foresee myself becoming a millionaire.  So I packed up and moved up to New York City and met Tom.  Tom was from the West Coast and was very laid back. He was originally Chinese, but he was not like the rest of us, bright eyed and bushy tailed and eager to learn about the inner workings of Wall Street.  Tom seemed out of place from the get go with his laid back demeanor and chill West Coast attitude\\u2026  Nearly every night as fresh analysts on Wall Street, we had some sort of activity, whether it was training program related (organized by the company) or just a group of us hot shot new analysts who wanted to go out and explore the city.  Tom rarely joined us for these events. Unless of course it was mandatory, at which point he left just as soon as it was over.  Over the course of the next year I befriended Tom and got to know him a little bit better. The more I got to know him, the more I realized the difference between him and many of the others in our class\\u2026he was frugal.  Super frugal.  He told me he never really cared to come to Wall Street but he just wanted to make some money and then go back to the West Coast and retire. He didn't need much he just wanted a comfortable living, which is why he rarely spent money. He lived over in Brooklyn since the rent was half the price as Manhattan. But Tom didn't mind the 35 minute commute on the subway because he wanted to save money.  After our two year analyst program in New York, many people in my class got promoted to associate and stayed on in NY. Some left to competing firms, and still others left the business all together.  I caught up with Tom and asked him what his plan was. After prodding and prying for a while Tom finally told me that between his salary and bonuses etc he had saved up nearly $60k USD over the last 2 years and once he got to $100k he was out and would move back to the West Coast and figure out the next step. Wall Street wasn't for him and he just wanted to jump start his retirement plan.  I was in shock when I heard this. Here I was living the high life of a slick city banker (read dbag) and after 2 years on Wall Street do you want to know what my savings was?  -$3700.00. Yes negative.  Not only had I spent everything I earned, I actually racked up credit card debt somehow. I had lived a life of excess and had nothing but higher cholesterol and weight gain to show for it. My YOLO attitude had backtracked me from the very reason I moved up to Wall Street to begin with\\u2026to build wealth.  I felt sick to my stomach after speaking to Tom and vowed to turn things around.  I lost touch with Tom over the years\\u2026I wish I hadn't. I'm not sure if he became a millionaire before 30 or not. But what I do know is that he was a hell of a lot farther along than I was after our first 2 years of work. He realized he had an opportunity to change his life and never took his eye off the ball.  Frugality is a core tenet of some of the wealthiest people in the world.

Then when it did people said it will never reach 0.01$ and so on.  Nothing goes just up. Right now doge is 10k% up for the year. I think that's amazing. Asking it do this every year is a bit silly.  One argument for its growth is the amount of coins it has. To that I respond with the physical currencies. They have no gold backing, they can issue unlimited currency and inflation can go up in a day.  Meanwhile doge you know what to expect. It has a steady supply that cannot be increased or decreased. Many wallets that had a lot of doge are inactive so we can consider some of them lost bringing the amount down. Bitcoin for example has 20% of its supply lost forever. I thing doge is more trustworthy than our dollar, euro etc. Tomorrow the fed can say we will issue trillions of dollars. Who is gonna stop them?  Market cap is pointless when we talk about currencies. I don't know who made this a trend but currencies are not assets. They are not companies. Bitcoin used to worth pennies.

I'll explain in a point and try to get at the motivation for this question in another.  #1 Why Doge Won't Go to $20  Right now, $DOGE is trading at around $.6 a coin. If you take that and multiply it by the total number of coins in existence, you get to its market capitalization, which is $79 billion (roughly).  If $DOGE were to go to $20, then its market cap would be $2.6 trillion. That's 2.6x Bitcoin's market cap.  That would make it more valuable than the most valuable company in the world, Saudi Aramco (at $2.5 trillion) and Apple (at $2.4 trillion).  Just no. Not going to happen. Certainly not in the next 12 months and not likely in the next 5 years.  #2 The Motivation For This Question  The motivation for this question is simple: if $DOGE were to go to $20, then it would do a little better than 33x.  So, I assume the questioner wants to know whether $DOGE can do at least 30x. The answer is no.  You are too late to this pump. Get over it and choose another one.  There are so many other cryptos out there that could do this\\u2014but you have to go outside the top 10 coins. You'll have to look at those in the 110 - 75 range (ranked by market cap).  My two favorite at or outside the top 100, because they are related to broader ecosystems are:  1. Voyager Token ($VGX) [ https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/voyager-token/ ], which is used for the Voyager Exchange. This exchange is available in the US and actually doesn't rip people off for their trades like Coinbase. It also lets you get interest 10% on your tokens right there (v. Coinbase's top yield of 2%). 2. Flow ($FLOW) [ https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/flow/ ], which is a layer 1 scalable blockchain by the developers of CryptoKitties and TopShot. Will it really beat $ETH? That's unlikely, but it could find a niche space and pump 10x. Ok, so there you go. The above statements are not recommendations for any of these, since the whole space is crazy right now. I just wanted to give you a sense of what it takes to pump even 10x.  The top 100 coins all have a market cap above $1 billion right now! So, those large gains are harder to find.

Several cryptocurrencies, primarily Dogecoin, are gaining wildfire popularity across the globe. After all, what is a dogecoin? Well, do you recall the viral doge meme that swept the internet a few days ago? Yes, it's the same meme that inspired framing the recent Dogecoin. Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus, two software developers, created Dogecoin and made the comical Shiba Inu dog as its ambassador to entertain people.  By now, you must be more intrigued to develop a cryptocurrency wallet app for Dogecoin, aren't you? So, let's dive deeper into the peer-to-peer cryptocurrency app's subtle details and build a fully functional product.  What Lies at the Dogecoin Back?  Jumping right into the essence: Dogecoin has blockchain technology, the core concept behind cryptocurrencies, at the back. Blockchain allows setting up a decentralized server for many systems and records all transactions using a virtual ledger. Woah! What does that mean? It implies that Dogecoin has no central server to track buy and sell operations yet impart the highest security to the assets than ever.  Blockchain technology lies at the core of many transactional processes where security stands as the priority. Its virtual ledger maintains transparency and safety to all transactions while keeping manipulations and breaches at bay. Consequently, you can estimate the power of blockchain-driven Dogecoin and its secure environment.  How Do You Buy Dogecoin?  You can buy cryptocurrencies through verified crypto exchange apps like Coinbase and Kraken. Besides, if you wish to invest in Dogecoins, you can head over to exchange platforms like Robinhood and WazirX that allow hassle-free crypto trading.  Steps to Follow to Buy Dogecoins  The steps to buying Dogecoin vary from one country to the other. Although, the following steps remain the same everywhere.   * Go to your application store and find a suitable Dogecoin wallet app like Exodus.  * Download the app and install it on your device.  * When installed, run the Dogecoin wallet.  * Pinpoint your Doge address.  * Get a crypto exchange app on your device like Kraken.  * Buy and withdraw your Dogecoin. Besides the above steps, you might also require to KYC your crypto account and feed your bank account information in the platform in India. Finally, you can add funds to your account and carry Dogecoin transactions.  Dogecoin Mining Process \\u2013 What's That?  Before going any further, you should be aware that there are two sorts of Dogecoin mining processes: solo and Dogecoin pool. As the name suggests, solo mining is done all by yourself, which makes confirming transactions way more competitive. However, the pool process might be a bit daunting. Don't worry! Let's try to understand Dogecoin pool mining closely.  Mining through a Doge pool lets you join a community by paying some fees. It allows mining together and guarantees you profit, although somewhat lesser than solo mining. Also, Dogecoin mining in a pool has a higher profit-making probability leading to your sure-shot incomes in a stipulated time.  Solo vs. Pool Mining \\u2013 What to Choose?  Solo Dogecoin mining requires trading expertise and confident moves to generate profits for cryptocurrencies. When you use the pool mining method, you trade in a community where your chances of success skyrocket.  Overall, solo mining may be rewarding for you if you are willing to trek alone and beat the fierce competition. If you want to avoid the risks, you can invest in Dogecoin pool mining and ensure your success.  How To Build A Cryptocurrency Wallet App For Dogecoin?  Now that you are well-acquainted with Dogecoin functionality, it's high time to learn about the app's developmental process. Developing a Dogecoin wallet app requires merging cutting-edge libraries like Blockchain, Bitcoinj, Chain-Java, etc. The steps to build a robust crypto wallet are:   * Download a cryptocurrency wallet API and install it.  * Create an all-new wallet by tapping the new project button (name might vary).  * Name your crypto wallet and set permissions to deny and allow Dogecoin transactions.  * Users would require checking their wallet balance and other services by accessing third-party integrations. So, complete your wallet by combining external widgets as needed. Besides using ready-made crypto wallet templates, you can build everything from scratch. Standard codes, libraries, and architecture are available online and require assembling them correctly to formulate a custom application for Dogecoin transactions. The custom development process will appear similar to: analyzing your objectives, framing the backend, designing the UI, and testing to remove glitches.  Furthermore, if you wish to hire offshore developers for your Dogecoin app project, then you will have to spend around $70,000 \\u2013 $90,000 depending on features enabled and platforms supported. Also, the cost might vary according to developer locations and their per-hour wages.  Are Dogecoins Worth the Investment?  Since 2013, Dogecoin has been a buzz in the cryptocurrency market. A seven-year timeline makes Dogecoin legitimate and credible enough for investments. So, if Dogecoins' reliability seemed intimidating to you, it's high to give it a shot at the earliest.  Adding to your delight, the Dogecoin price is at the lowest point allowing small to big parties to invest in the cryptocurrency market freely. They can afford to incur such a modest risk to learn how to purchase and sell in the crypto market and trade properly.  The Dogecoin market eliminates banking fees, allowing investors to earn more money. So, if you want to invest in banking charge-free options, Dogecoin is the best alternative for you.  According to experts, the Dogecoin market is still relatively new and may encounter much turmoil in the future. As a result, an investor should only trade Dogecoin if the resulting fund losses will not be detrimental.  So, it's safe to conclude that Dogecoin is reliable, secure, and encompasses lesser risks than any other investment method. Hence, try out investing in Dogecoins and generate higher profits that you wouldn't have imagined.  Undoubtedly, Dogecoin costs are way lower than other cryptocurrency types like Ethereum and Bitcoins. However, the lesser the price, the lower the risk factor. So, Dogecoins make wise investments and entail compact risks that are bearable for small investors even.

With a circulating supply of 129 Billion DOGE at present, a price of $1,000 per unit would give Dogecoin a market cap of 129 TRILLION USD.  All money in circulation on planet earth is thought to be around 37 trillion USD in total, so that means Dogecoin would have 4X the value of all money in circulation on planet earth.  Since all money, including assets in the forms of investments, derivatives, and cryptocurrencies is said to exceed $1.2 quadrillion USD, Dogecoin's marketcap would account for approximately 10% of this total value.

If memory serves the doge cap is about 100 trillion and the circulating(how many mined) is at about 100 billion.  0.00000028 BTC = The actual reality of doge. I can mine many per day take them to an exchange and if I try real hard I can get maybe 0.00000035 BTC or if I am patient even 0.00000045 BTC per coin.  Thus from a miners point of view Doge is worth more than is stated on its profile because as a miner once you mine that coin, its all yours and you can get more than its worth because a miner does something a trader can never do, and that is, make their own stocks to sell.  Doge has been at about .006 average for a long time. So when its .01 its at a penny. Considering it started at 0.00000001, it has moved a long way considering its a tier 2 coin.

Interestingly, this moocher class apparently includes Marketeers, creators of pointless web 2.0 crud, tradeshow freaks, braindamaged pseudo-entrepreneurs working in VC entertainment. The scum of this Earth.  Some of the charges of scam are a bit weakened by the fact that no one is making money off Dogecoin\\u2013that's one of the great heresies.  It is clear that a big problem with Dogecoin is that those people like it. We are treated to vicious smears, basically indicating that all those blood sucking takers favor Dogecoin. Dogecoin users are idiots and retarded; they are silly kid[s] so deprived of human contact, halfwit[s] spending his hard-earned government dole to be part of something, everyone with something to give. [T]he kids, the unemployed, the unemployable.  Those people.  (IMO, it's not a brilliant rhetorical strategy to slash at everyone with something to give. Next, you'll be blasting the deep immorality of cute pictures of puppies. Oh, wait. Dogecoin is based on the pictures of cute doggies standard. Uh oh.)  In contrast, Bitcoinistas are in crypto for crypto, and understand the true rugged beauty of BC (to quote another enthusiast). Bitcoin isn't deflationary, which isn't a problem anyway, because I said so. Anyone who says otherwise, They're that stupid, these people.  Phew!  You don't need me to connect this rhetoric to the Ran Paul/Paul Ryan strain of libertarian politics. The references to those people make that very clear.  But why all this flame directed at Dogecoin specifically? Clearly, Dogecoin has gained popular recognition, nearly as great as Bitcoin. The son is rivaling the father, which is a tense situation. (I might say the daughter is rivallng the mother, but this is an all male affair, as far as I can see. Which reminds me: isn't it time for FemCoin?)  Dogecoin's narrative is deliberately designed to mock and undermine aspects of Bitcoin's narrative. Judging by the vehement and irrational responses, there are enthusiasts who have considerable personal commitment to these narratives, and are therefore threatened by alternative narratives.  If Dogecoin can succeed despite not being serious, and by taking alternative design choices from Bitcoin, then neither Bitcoin's technology nor its narrative are self-evidently right (nor inevitably successful).  For those true believers (and MP obviously is a very true believer), the success of Dogecoin is deeply wrong and even immoral.  This psychological dynamic probably drives some of the Dogecoin narrative. From the start, Dogecoin was deliberately a story about being not Bitcoin. The design decisions (e.g., to not have a cap, and to welcome regulation) were made for very good ideological reasons, which is why they are so idiotic for Bitcoinistas: Dogecoin dared to choose wrong, and, astonishingly, the heavens didn't fall.

Investing is not a guaranteed way to make money, so make sure you know the risks and can afford to lose the money.  Cryptocurrencies are also highly volatile, so your cash can go down as well as up.  What is Dogecoin?  Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency which was launched in 2013.  Originally invented as a joke by software engineers Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus, the Dogecoin has the image of a Shuba Inu dog as its logo.  It has been marketed as the \\\"fun\\\" version of bitcoin.  Two weeks after its launch, the value of it jumped 300% after China banned banks from investing in cryptocurrencies, according to Investopedia.  Dogecoin then skyrocketed alongside other cryptos during the bubble that peaked in 2017, and it fell with the rest of them over 2018.Investing in cryptocurrencies can be an intriguing prospect for a portion of your portfolio, but you should make sure to diversify your investments with other holdings. Aside buying and holding cryptocurrency for potential gains which is a huge advantage of the benefits derived from cryptocurrency,as a cryptocurrency trade deciding on which crypto coin to choose from can be really difficult, I also recommend that you invest in service companies such as the Zippercoin(www.zippercoin.tech)company, a cryptocurrency investment company that gives return on investments made in days by capitalizing on the volatility of the crypto market to generate profits giving you better chance in the cryptocurrency market.  At its height, Dogecoin was trading for $0.018 per coin, according to crypto data firm CoinMarketCap.  Why is the value of it going up now?  At its height on Friday (January 29), Dogecoin was trading for $0.075 (5.5p) per coin, according to crypto data firm CoinMarketCap.  It jumped by a staggering 972% from $0.007 (less than 1p) the day before.  Later on Friday it started falling which continued into the weekend and then on Sunday it started going up again.  At the time of writing today (Monday February 1), Dogecoin is trading at $0.039 (2.8p), up by 41% over the last 24 hours but still below Friday's high.  The turbulence comes off the back of a bunch of Reddit threads calling for it to hit a value of $1 per coin.  Shares rocketed after an army of amateur traders targeted the games retailer, causing professional hedge funds who'd shorted it to lose billions.  But for the amateur traders, the surge saw them make some serious cash.  In simple terms, \\\"short selling\\\" is when professional investors borrow shares of stock to sell, and then buy them back at a lower price.  Essentially, they are betting that the stocks will drop in value so they can pocket the profit when they hand them back to the company they borrowed them from.  They rely on the company failing, which makes it a risky way of raising cash.  To prove a point, the Reddit community called WallStreetBets decided to take on the hedge fund by buying up GameStop stock as quickly as possible, driving up share prices.  But the hedge fund still needed to return the borrowed stock so it ended up buying back the shares at a hugely inflated price, costing them billions.  This made the price soar even more. The GameStop losses caused the hedge fund to go bust."}, {"upvote": 13, "content": "Which is the best, legal Dogecoin wallet?"}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-invest-in-Dogecoin-1", "question": "How can I invest in Dogecoin 1", "answers": [{"upvote": 1, "content": "No\\u2026Strickly no\\u2026.don't fall into trap. $doge reached 0.45 cents today\\u2026wait for the consolidation period.

Then Elon stated that he was working with the Doge team to make it more sustainable [ https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/elon-musk-dogecoin-interest-is-not-new-he-is-in-touch-with-developers-since-2019-1803171-2021-05-16 ].  And then indicated that he might be selling Bitcoin with the following cryptic Tweet.  https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1394001894809427971 That Tweet tanked the entire crypto market.  Then news broke that Elon was lying about working with the Doge team [ https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/breaking-elon-never-contacted-us-says-dogecoin-lead-developer/ ]. The lead developer stated flatly that he's never communicated with Elon.  Then Elon clarified that he hadn't yet sold any Bitcoin [ https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/16/elon-musk-suggests-tesla-is-dumping-bitcoin.html ] (as he said he hadn't in the first announcement).

One of my key indicators for the crypto-market is a remarkably simple signal\\u2014the simple moving average (SMA) of the past 160 days for Bitcoin.  As long as the price of Bitcoin is above it, I think the market is healthy. When it drops below, I start to scale out (I have other indicators for further scaling).  Here's an image of Bitcoin's price action over the past year. The red line is the SMA 50 and the black line is the SMA 160.  I explain some of my main indicators in this article [ https://theartofthebubble.substack.com/p/3-smart-ways-to-improve-your-momentum ] and I honestly follow them. Of course, there are lots of little details.  Given this bearish signal, I sold. Not everything, but about 50% of my Ethereum holdings that I would only pay capital gains on (I live in the US and this is a big concern). It was about 1/3 of my crypto holdings.   * I cashed out that trade for a 17.7x return. I didn't sell $DOGE because:  (1) I'd have to pay higher taxes on my gains,  (2) I have a small amount and the transaction costs would be too large a portion of the trade to make it that profitable, and  (3) I don't think the bull run is done yet.  #3 Concluding Thoughts  If the Bitcoin bull run continues, I think that $DOGE has an especially bright future.  Even if Elon doesn't work with $DOGE to make it greener, there is one major positive: Coinbase is going to list $DOGE coin on its exchange [ https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2021/05/15/coinbase-reveals-dogecoin-bombshell-as-bitcoin-and-crypto-price-fears-grip-the-market/?sh=1882c4c954fe ].  I explain in detail why The Exchange Trade-Up can result in 100% returns even though nothing fundamental changes in this article [ https://theartofthebubble.substack.com/p/when-no-change-makes-for-massive ]. It may not have that dramatic an improvement, but I am still optimistic.  In brief, I still like the coin.  Happy Trading!!

Current Statistics:  With a market cap of 322,904,655 USD as on April 24, 2019, at 11:54:00 UTC, Dogecoin (DOGE) is ranked 26th in the top 100 cryptocurrencies list by the CoinMarketCap.

Investing is not a guaranteed way to make money, so make sure you know the risks and can afford to lose the money.  Cryptocurrencies are also highly volatile, so your cash can go down as well as up.  What is Dogecoin?  Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency which was launched in 2013.  Originally invented as a joke by software engineers Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus, the Dogecoin has the image of a Shuba Inu dog as its logo.  It has been marketed as the \\\"fun\\\" version of bitcoin.  Two weeks after its launch, the value of it jumped 300% after China banned banks from investing in cryptocurrencies, according to Investopedia.  Dogecoin then skyrocketed alongside other cryptos during the bubble that peaked in 2017, and it fell with the rest of them over 2018.Investing in cryptocurrencies can be an intriguing prospect for a portion of your portfolio, but you should make sure to diversify your investments with other holdings. Aside buying and holding cryptocurrency for potential gains which is a huge advantage of the benefits derived from cryptocurrency,as a cryptocurrency trade deciding on which crypto coin to choose from can be really difficult, I also recommend that you invest in service companies such as the Zippercoin(www.zippercoin.tech)company, a cryptocurrency investment company that gives return on investments made in days by capitalizing on the volatility of the crypto market to generate profits giving you better chance in the cryptocurrency market.  At its height, Dogecoin was trading for $0.018 per coin, according to crypto data firm CoinMarketCap.  Why is the value of it going up now?  At its height on Friday (January 29), Dogecoin was trading for $0.075 (5.5p) per coin, according to crypto data firm CoinMarketCap.  It jumped by a staggering 972% from $0.007 (less than 1p) the day before.  Later on Friday it started falling which continued into the weekend and then on Sunday it started going up again.  At the time of writing today (Monday February 1), Dogecoin is trading at $0.039 (2.8p), up by 41% over the last 24 hours but still below Friday's high.  The turbulence comes off the back of a bunch of Reddit threads calling for it to hit a value of $1 per coin.  Shares rocketed after an army of amateur traders targeted the games retailer, causing professional hedge funds who'd shorted it to lose billions.  But for the amateur traders, the surge saw them make some serious cash.  In simple terms, \\\"short selling\\\" is when professional investors borrow shares of stock to sell, and then buy them back at a lower price.  Essentially, they are betting that the stocks will drop in value so they can pocket the profit when they hand them back to the company they borrowed them from.  They rely on the company failing, which makes it a risky way of raising cash.  To prove a point, the Reddit community called WallStreetBets decided to take on the hedge fund by buying up GameStop stock as quickly as possible, driving up share prices.  But the hedge fund still needed to return the borrowed stock so it ended up buying back the shares at a hugely inflated price, costing them billions.  This made the price soar even more. The GameStop losses caused the hedge fund to go bust."}, {"upvote": 10, "content": "Can I expect Dogecoin to go up to 1$ by 2018?"}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/When-will-Coinbase-adopt-Dogecoin", "question": "When will Coinbase adopt Dogecoin", "answers": [{"upvote": 5, "content": "They won't anytime soon for two reasons: philosophically and technically.

DOGE was created as a joke and is still toyed with quite a bit by rich celebrities.  Both Elon Musk and Mark Cuban have recently tweeted about the crypto. This caused a buying frenzy and so much volatility that RobinHood's crypto trading platform froze the asset for a while.  Why do you think Cuban and Musk tweeted about DOGE coin? Well think about it just a bit. If you were a billionaire, you probably would have quite a few different investments. You would probably even have your own hedge fund that was somehow encrypted in its connection to you.  This is just pure speculation, but my guess would be that both Musk and Cuban own DOGE. They might not own it personally in their own wallet or account but in one of their venture capital funds or hedge funds they probably hold a sizable position. Musk for sure has been interested in buying Bitcoin and after making a sizable purchase a few weeks ago, BTC started soaring up in price.  Watching BTC go up like crazy they were probably trying to figure out how to unload some other asset that was not performing well so that they could buy more BTC. This would certainly explain the positive comments about DOGE as after musk did said things about DOGE the coin had a massive move from around 1.5 cents all the way up to around 8 cents.  But this kind of hype, pump and dump plans and such is just the kind of thing Coinbase wants to stay away from.

The scum of this Earth.  Some of the charges of scam are a bit weakened by the fact that no one is making money off Dogecoin\\u2013that's one of the great heresies.  It is clear that a big problem with Dogecoin is that those people like it. We are treated to vicious smears, basically indicating that all those blood sucking takers favor Dogecoin. Dogecoin users are idiots and retarded; they are silly kid[s] so deprived of human contact, halfwit[s] spending his hard-earned government dole to be part of something, everyone with something to give. [T]he kids, the unemployed, the unemployable.  Those people.  (IMO, it's not a brilliant rhetorical strategy to slash at everyone with something to give. Next, you'll be blasting the deep immorality of cute pictures of puppies. Oh, wait. Dogecoin is based on the pictures of cute doggies standard. Uh oh.)  In contrast, Bitcoinistas are in crypto for crypto, and understand the true rugged beauty of BC (to quote another enthusiast). Bitcoin isn't deflationary, which isn't a problem anyway, because I said so. Anyone who says otherwise, They're that stupid, these people.  Phew!  You don't need me to connect this rhetoric to the Ran Paul/Paul Ryan strain of libertarian politics. The references to those people make that very clear.  But why all this flame directed at Dogecoin specifically? Clearly, Dogecoin has gained popular recognition, nearly as great as Bitcoin. The son is rivaling the father, which is a tense situation. (I might say the daughter is rivallng the mother, but this is an all male affair, as far as I can see. Which reminds me: isn't it time for FemCoin?)  Dogecoin's narrative is deliberately designed to mock and undermine aspects of Bitcoin's narrative. Judging by the vehement and irrational responses, there are enthusiasts who have considerable personal commitment to these narratives, and are therefore threatened by alternative narratives.  If Dogecoin can succeed despite not being serious, and by taking alternative design choices from Bitcoin, then neither Bitcoin's technology nor its narrative are self-evidently right (nor inevitably successful).  For those true believers (and MP obviously is a very true believer), the success of Dogecoin is deeply wrong and even immoral.  This psychological dynamic probably drives some of the Dogecoin narrative. From the start, Dogecoin was deliberately a story about being not Bitcoin. The design decisions (e.g., to not have a cap, and to welcome regulation) were made for very good ideological reasons, which is why they are so idiotic for Bitcoinistas: Dogecoin dared to choose wrong, and, astonishingly, the heavens didn't fall. This cannot stand."}, {"upvote": 30, "content": "Coinbase Misses Out on Dogecoin Listing as Meme Token Rallies 6,000%+ on Binance.

I'll explain in a point and try to get at the motivation for this question in another.  #1 Why Doge Won't Go to $20  Right now, $DOGE is trading at around $.6 a coin. If you take that and multiply it by the total number of coins in existence, you get to its market capitalization, which is $79 billion (roughly).  If $DOGE were to go to $20, then its market cap would be $2.6 trillion. That's 2.6x Bitcoin's market cap.  That would make it more valuable than the most valuable company in the world, Saudi Aramco (at $2.5 trillion) and Apple (at $2.4 trillion).  Just no. Not going to happen. Certainly not in the next 12 months and not likely in the next 5 years.  #2 The Motivation For This Question  The motivation for this question is simple: if $DOGE were to go to $20, then it would do a little better than 33x.  So, I assume the questioner wants to know whether $DOGE can do at least 30x. The answer is no.  You are too late to this pump. Get over it and choose another one.  There are so many other cryptos out there that could do this\\u2014but you have to go outside the top 10 coins. You'll have to look at those in the 110 - 75 range (ranked by market cap).  My two favorite at or outside the top 100, because they are related to broader ecosystems are:  1. Voyager Token ($VGX) [ https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/voyager-token/ ], which is used for the Voyager Exchange. This exchange is available in the US and actually doesn't rip people off for their trades like Coinbase. It also lets you get interest 10% on your tokens right there (v. Coinbase's top yield of 2%). 2. Flow ($FLOW) [ https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/flow/ ], which is a layer 1 scalable blockchain by the developers of CryptoKitties and TopShot. Will it really beat $ETH? That's unlikely, but it could find a niche space and pump 10x. Ok, so there you go. The above statements are not recommendations for any of these, since the whole space is crazy right now. I just wanted to give you a sense of what it takes to pump even 10x.  The top 100 coins all have a market cap above $1 billion right now! So, those large gains are harder to find.

Unbelievable if it were, say, a stock, but this is a cryptocurrency. And a very popular one. In the last year it has surged 18,000%.  Dogecoin has uses, and it has appealing qualities.  It's very fast. It takes approximately 2 minutes to send any amount, for an extremely low transaction fee of 1 Dogecoin. That beats every other cryptocurrency by those metrics.  And the use case for Dogecoin, I'd argue, is as a stable coin, believe it or not. For 99.99% of its existence it has had an extremely stable price right around $0.005. That's a good thing if you want to, for example, lock in gains from other cryptocurrencies but don't want to 1. pay taxes on gains immediately by selling for USD and 2. continue on the price rollercoaster that all cryptocurrencies seem to go on simultaneously.

To get to $20 DOGE would need to be more than 2.5times as valuable as BTC is now. 5Billion new coins a year means that number will only get bigger.  Like I say it's theoretically possible but highly unlikely (to say the least). It would probably require some kind of mass adoption of DOGE for this to happen and given that DOGE has no real practical everyday use (too slow for payments & high coin supply & inflation make it less than ideal as a store of value) highly unlikely is being generous, it would practically count as a miracle."}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "No. People need to learn what a marketcap is and how it works.

With a circulating supply of 129 Billion DOGE at present, a price of $1,000 per unit would give Dogecoin a market cap of 129 TRILLION USD.  All money in circulation on planet earth is thought to be around 37 trillion USD in total, so that means Dogecoin would have 4X the value of all money in circulation on planet earth.  Since all money, including assets in the forms of investments, derivatives, and cryptocurrencies is said to exceed $1.2 quadrillion USD, Dogecoin's marketcap would account for approximately 10% of this total value.

Then when it did people said it will never reach 0.01$ and so on.  Nothing goes just up. Right now doge is 10k% up for the year. I think that's amazing. Asking it do this every year is a bit silly.  One argument for its growth is the amount of coins it has. To that I respond with the physical currencies. They have no gold backing, they can issue unlimited currency and inflation can go up in a day.  Meanwhile doge you know what to expect. It has a steady supply that cannot be increased or decreased. Many wallets that had a lot of doge are inactive so we can consider some of them lost bringing the amount down. Bitcoin for example has 20% of its supply lost forever. I thing doge is more trustworthy than our dollar, euro etc. Tomorrow the fed can say we will issue trillions of dollars. Who is gonna stop them?  Market cap is pointless when we talk about currencies. I don't know who made this a trend but currencies are not assets. They are not companies. Bitcoin used to worth pennies. Did anyone care about market cap then? Now they cap doge to the bitcoin market cap. Even if we do accept that if doge coin raises in price x10 now it will still be under bitcoin in market cap making its price go to 2.5 euros.  Don't pay attention to market cap. I mined doge 8 years ago.eft them on my wallet and just waited. Back then they were worth 17 euros. Do the math.  There are wallets with huge amounts and they didn't sell at 0.6$ why do you think is that?  First wallet is the Robin hood one even if they don't admit it. That's because in that platform you don't trade doge. You trade its price. That's why you can't take them out of the platform. Robin hood is the main reason doge is low in price. When they allow doge to be in private wallets then the price will skyrocket.  I am not a financial advisor and I am not giving you financial advice.

Maybe Doge will pump higher again and reach a new higher high, or maybe only reach out the previous high and touch it gently, making dogecoin holders richer again, but as something is just a trend, I would suggest you to invest in something more strategical and notable that will make you a certainly smaller profit (that's relative), but it won't be a total gamble. A probably profitable and attention-catching crypto at the moment is Ethereum, cryptocurrency born years ago that has been one of the first pillars in this world.

It's supposedly decentralized, though that's questionable. It derives its value from the number of people storing their value in it and expanding the betworkz and it's still supported mainly by the people, with the potential on some bigger names getting on board.

I don't think there are enough serious people behind dogecoins network to carry the hype into real long term value.

Investing is not a guaranteed way to make money, so make sure you know the risks and can afford to lose the money.  Cryptocurrencies are also highly volatile, so your cash can go down as well as up.  What is Dogecoin?  Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency which was launched in 2013.  Originally invented as a joke by software engineers Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus, the Dogecoin has the image of a Shuba Inu dog as its logo.  It has been marketed as the \\\"fun\\\" version of bitcoin.  Two weeks after its launch, the value of it jumped 300% after China banned banks from investing in cryptocurrencies, according to Investopedia.  Dogecoin then skyrocketed alongside other cryptos during the bubble that peaked in 2017, and it fell with the rest of them over 2018.Investing in cryptocurrencies can be an intriguing prospect for a portion of your portfolio, but you should make sure to diversify your investments with other holdings. Aside buying and holding cryptocurrency for potential gains which is a huge advantage of the benefits derived from cryptocurrency,as a cryptocurrency trade deciding on which crypto coin to choose from can be really difficult, I also recommend that you invest in service companies such as the Zippercoin(www.zippercoin.tech)company, a cryptocurrency investment company that gives return on investments made in days by capitalizing on the volatility of the crypto market to generate profits giving you better chance in the cryptocurrency market.  At its height, Dogecoin was trading for $0.018 per coin, according to crypto data firm CoinMarketCap.  Why is the value of it going up now?  At its height on Friday (January 29), Dogecoin was trading for $0.075 (5.5p) per coin, according to crypto data firm CoinMarketCap.  It jumped by a staggering 972% from $0.007 (less than 1p) the day before.  Later on Friday it started falling which continued into the weekend and then on Sunday it started going up again.  At the time of writing today (Monday February 1), Dogecoin is trading at $0.039 (2.8p), up by 41% over the last 24 hours but still below Friday's high.  The turbulence comes off the back of a bunch of Reddit threads calling for it to hit a value of $1 per coin.  Shares rocketed after an army of amateur traders targeted the games retailer, causing professional hedge funds who'd shorted it to lose billions.  But for the amateur traders, the surge saw them make some serious cash.  In simple terms, \\\"short selling\\\" is when professional investors borrow shares of stock to sell, and then buy them back at a lower price.  Essentially, they are betting that the stocks will drop in value so they can pocket the profit when they hand them back to the company they borrowed them from.  They rely on the company failing, which makes it a risky way of raising cash.  To prove a point, the Reddit community called WallStreetBets decided to take on the hedge fund by buying up GameStop stock as quickly as possible, driving up share prices.  But the hedge fund still needed to return the borrowed stock so it ended up buying back the shares at a hugely inflated price, costing them billions.  This made the price soar even more. The GameStop losses caused the hedge fund to go bust."}, {"upvote": 5, "content": "Which merchants accept Dogecoin?"}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-expected-price-of-Dogecoin-at-the-end-of-2017", "question": "Whats the expected price of Dogecoin at the end of 2017", "answers": [{"upvote": 4, "content": "There is no expected price.

Have you actually looked at least one of many live exchanges where you can see Dogecoin being traded with other currencies?  If you did then you get an answer to your question.  You can see book orders and order fill histories. You can watch most current value change as orders are filled.  It is a software-driven and automated process that runs 24/7 each day of the week. Each exchange has a script based upon exchange rules, policies and procedures. Each exchange is an open marketplace where any member can be a buyer or seller at any time. Members can choose to buy or sell with market orders (instant buys or sells as in a store) or limit orders where the member sets up a table and sells assets at preset volumes and prices.  It is a type of online computer game, really.  Please take time to view a live exchange. Here is DOGE-USD on CoinbasePro. If you are using a computer the page will appear.

Red is sell orders. Green is buy orders. When the order reaches the last trade price it fills. It is mathematical and logical process as directed by the Coinbase trading script.  If you view the list of orders you can try and guess which way it is going to go in the short term. Look at large orders and how they move closer to the spread bar. The large orders when filled cause the chart line to dip down or spike up depending upon how much the volume changed with the trade. (I have yet to find exact formula for this.)  You can see an example of a large dip in the long red jagged line that appears on the chart in the 5 minute view. For me it starts at 20:25 CST.  Let's pretend (with paper trading:) that you owned 1,000 DOGE and you sold 1,000 DOGE before it dropped. Then at the lowest point about an hour later you buy DOGE with USD. This is an example of what some traders are doing.  I see a big green bar that is a large order set at a price. When it drops to that price the trader member order will be filled. It can happen today, later tonight, later this week or perhaps next month.  That is why trading is for those who have extra cash assets to use not needed for anything else. As with a business, cash is used to keep the firm running at all hours.  Does this look fun and exciting to you?  Or not?  SUMMARY  Yes there are natural limits. Say hello to RSI.

That is basically an 8x gain in value. In April the price went to about $0.30 which is another 5x gain in value. Overall the price of Dogecoin went about 37x from its average in January.  The traditional investing pattern would suggest this is some sort of pump and dump if this was a price movement of a penny stock. In the case of Dogecoin, we know what happened. Elon Musk basically made some meme-related posts about it and it propelled the currency up with many day traders buying it with a belief that they will be able to get out in time if it drops. In that sense, this was a classic pump but this is not a nefarious illegal sort of pump and dump because Elon as far as we know it did not make a big investment in the currency only to dump it for a profit which would be illegal.  The fact that Dogecoin has maintained the $0.3 level value for six days now is already pretty incredible in its own right. The people who day traded it for a quick sensible profit have probably long exited their position by now. So the question should be as to who is buying and selling right now?  Who is buying?  1. People who feel the currency is fairly priced if Elon Musk continues to support it. These folks feel Elon Musk has some sort of plan that he has not announced yet. Perhaps he is waiting for some technical indicator before he makes his next move. He has the power to convince the board of Tesla to allow acceptance of Dogecoin as payment to purchase cars which would be a huge benefit to the currency. The marketing of the currency gives it a value of its own. 2. People who feel the currency may have some staying power. Perhaps it can maintain its status of major cryptocurrency if the meme nature of it continues or some more celebrities join in on the joke or simply that many more people start using it for everyday things. Perhaps the incredible rise will encourage the community to continue to advance the currency on technical levels. Who is selling?  1. People who don't agree with the people who are buying. They don't think the currency has any staying power and they think this is a dilutional fantasy that it could somehow get to $1 if enough people make meme posts about it. 2. Most importantly the people who are long-term holders of a lot of the currency that was mined early on. These are the so-called whales. These folks have come into incredible wealth basically by luck. It is like a thousand people all of a sudden won the jackpot in the lottery on the same day. Do you think a lot of them won't be heading to the cash register? Let's say someone had a million Dogecoins in their wallet and they pretty much forgot about it for years. Now, this is worth like $1M all of a sudden. I think anyone rational would be crazy to not at least cash in half to pay off a mortgage or student loans and secure their financial independence. The super whales who have so much dogecoin they have become wealthy beyond most people's imagination should at least know if they try to sell it all at once on public exchange it would crash the price so perhaps they are not so selfish as to do that. By the way, the point about whales selling now is actually a great thing for cryptocurrency's health. This may suck for anyone who FOMOed into buying it at $0.42 as they are down about 20% right now but it is a great thing for Dogecoin as a whole. Elon Musk hinted that he liked to see whales divest of some of their holdings in Dogecoin in order for him to seriously back it. Maybe some of them are doing that right now and simply following his advice. If that is the case there can be some long-term upside to Dogecoin. It matters that asset like cryptocurrency is widely owned and used in order to it to maintain it's value.  Also, I like to note that the mainstream media is busy writing all sorts of Dogecoin is in a bubble and warning newbie investors how careful they should be. I get what they are doing but writing over-the-top headlines is a bit too much. Every new investor should know that buying Dogecoin at these historically high prices is very risky and there is a good chance of downside in the short term but there are some chances of an upside as well so buying it is not totally irrational.  Disclaimer. Personally, I have a positive bias towards Dogecoin because of simply human phycology. I happen to have mined a little bit of it in 2014 as an experiment without having any hope of it gaining much value in the future. I was pleasantly surprised by its rise in price making me an accidental Dogecoin winner. I feel sort of like I won the lottery but got the lower value lottery ticker with fewer numbers guessed. Like the guy who won $100K in a lottery, enough to be happy but not enough to be like I am going to quit my day job happy."}, {"upvote": 22, "content": "Dogecoin and other similar meme coins are controlled by celebrities.

Well, actually your computer (or node) has to do some work! This work involves the confirming and checking of transactions.  Lots of computers work on the same block of transactions at the same time but the only one can win the reward of new coins. The one that earns the new coins is the node that adds the new block of transactions to the old block of transactions. This is completed using complex mathematical equations.The node that solves the mathematical problem first wins!

FAQ on mobile cryptocurrency mining on smartphones, updated for 2021 Q. Can I mine cryptocurrency on my smartphone? A. Ignoring mine Dogecoin in your mobile fact that mining cryptocurrencies requires a huge amount of processing power, Google and Apple don't allow on-device mining on Android and iOS hardware. The ban, originally introduced in 2018 is still applicable. Google's latest Developer Program Policy (effective January 20, 2021) clearly states: We don't allow apps that mine cryptocurrency on devices. We permit apps that remotely manage mine Dogecoin in your mobile mining of cryptocurrency. Q. Why did Google ban crypto mining apps? A. Mining crypto puts mine Dogecoin in your mobile processor and other components in mine Dogecoin in your mobile device under extreme stress, and also drains mine Dogecoin in your mobile battery. The Apple Store guidelines state that Apps should not rapidly drain battery, generate excessive heat, or put unnecessary strain on device resources. While Google hasn't specified mine Dogecoin in your mobile reasons for delisting mine Dogecoin in your mobile crypto mining apps, we can assume they did so because of mine Dogecoin in your mobile same reasons, that is, to prevent mine Dogecoin in your mobile devices from overheating and damaging mine Dogecoin in your mobile hardware. Q. But I still see some mining apps listed in mine Dogecoin in your mobile Play Store. What gives? A. As noted in mine Dogecoin in your mobile policy listed above, Google allows apps that help you manage cryptocurrency mining that's being done remotely, either in mine Dogecoin in your mobile cloud, or on your computer. Apps such as MinerGate Control do not really mine cryptocurrency on your smartphone. Instead, they enable you to keep track of mine Dogecoin in your mobile mining operation that's being done remotely, and perhaps even cash out any crypto that's been mined on your behalf in mine Dogecoin in your mobile cloud. Q. So is there no way I can make cryptocurrencies using my phone? A. Virtually all mine Dogecoin in your mobile crypto apps on mine Dogecoin in your mobile Play Store either allow you to manage mine Dogecoin in your mobile remote cloud mining tasks, or pay out rewards and giveaways in some other fashion. Q. But I found a mining app on mine Dogecoin in your mobile Internet. Couldn't I just sideload it? A. While Google doesn't stop you from sideloading an app, we can give you two reasons why you shouldn't even consider it. Firstly, most security experts agree that sideloaded apps from third-parties are usually riddled with malware. Since mine Dogecoin in your mobile app developers don't have to adhere to mine Dogecoin in your mobile strict guidelines imposed by mine Dogecoin in your mobile app stores, what's stopping them from sneaking in malware under mine Dogecoin in your mobile garb of a legitimate app. And do you know what's mine Dogecoin in your mobile most common type of mobile malware floating around these days? Cryptomining malware! Q. Wait, what? A. Yes, and this brings us to mine Dogecoin in your mobile second point. Like we've said before, smartphones don't have mine Dogecoin in your mobile kind of processing prowess that's required to mine crypto in any meaningful fashion. For instance, according to estimates, mine Dogecoin in your mobile HTC Exodus 1S smartphone, which comes with its own mining app, will take over a century to mine enough crypto to pay for itself! For instance, mine Dogecoin in your mobile way mine Dogecoin in your mobile software that mines bitcoins is written, while mine Dogecoin in your mobile time taken to produce a bitcoin doesn't vary, mine Dogecoin in your mobile computing power used to produce it does. This means that as more people join mine Dogecoin in your mobile Bitcoin network and try to mine bitcoins, more computing power is used to make a bitcoin. While computing mine Dogecoin in your mobile real cost of minting cryptocurrency is a long drawn process, and is constantly evolving, it is safe to say that you'll end up spending more money in electricity and cooling costs than mine Dogecoin in your mobile value of mine Dogecoin in your mobile mined crypto. So instead of borrowing a supercomputer, malware writers hijack mine Dogecoin in your mobile processor in your mobile phone (and computers) and use them to mine crypto.

It might be Year of mine Dogecoin in your mobile Ox in China, but for mine Dogecoin in your mobile crypto world, it is mine Dogecoin in your mobile Year of mine Dogecoin in your mobile Dog. The Shiba Inu-based meme currency dogecoin has zoomed 13,000% since mine Dogecoin in your mobile start of mine Dogecoin in your mobile year and is showing no signs of stopping. Mint explores. Ah, cryptocurrency. The dream of a digital asset that is based not on paper money backed by gold or silver but built on secure transactions and a decentralized network that is open to all. Well, it's a lot more complicated than that and in mine Dogecoin in your mobile year 2021, there are more cryptocurrencies than any sane person can keep track of. Unless you live under a rock, you've probably heard of Bitcoin which is widely considered mine Dogecoin in your mobile first-every cryptocurrency and also birthed mine Dogecoin in your mobile blockchain technology behind most cryptocurrencies. I'll spare you mine Dogecoin in your mobile long, drawn-out details of how it works because honestly, I'm really not that well-versed in mine Dogecoin in your mobile technology myself. To dumb it down, many cryptocurrencies are built on blockchain tech that utilizes various types of computers and networks to confirm digital transactions. In mine Dogecoin in your mobile process, digital coin, or crypto, is mined as a reward to mine Dogecoin in your mobile miners confirming mine Dogecoin in your mobile transactions. These are called mining rewards. Again, there's way more to it than that but you can go to Wikipedia or a million other sites to find out more details on how it all works. While cryptocurrencies offer mine Dogecoin in your mobile promise of decentralization and security with many boasting anonymous online transactions, there is no good without some bad, and crypto has its fair share of negatives. For starters, mine Dogecoin in your mobile anonymous nature of many cryptocurrencies has led to digital tokens being mine Dogecoin in your mobile currency of choice for a lot of dark web activity and other nefarious practices. That said, anything that involves money has mine Dogecoin in your mobile potential to be used for evil and cryptocurrency is in no way mine Dogecoin in your mobile first asset to be used in an unsavory manner. The bigger, more obvious problem with most cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Monero is that they require intense amounts of computing power and electricity to be profitable. When mine Dogecoin in your mobile Bitcoin blockchain first launched over a decade ago, users could easily mine large amounts of Bitcoin from personal devices. Of course, back then Bitcoin was nearly worthless at less than a penny per coin until a significant price bump to $0.08 per coin in 2010. Fast forward a decade and Bitcoin is now priced at more than $57,000 and even broke mine Dogecoin in your mobile $60K mark earlier this year. Mining even a single Bitcoin in 2021would take years using a powerful GPU like mine Dogecoin in your mobile NVIDIA GTX 3090. It would take more than a year just to recover mine Dogecoin in your mobile cost of mine Dogecoin in your mobile GPU before you actually made a profit and that's not taking into consideration mine Dogecoin in your mobile cost of electricity. This is mine Dogecoin in your mobile main reason it is nearly impossible to get a good GPU at a decent price right now. It is also mine Dogecoin in your mobile reason for mine Dogecoin in your mobile birth of mining-specific hardware known as ASIC miners. These are powerful, energy-hungry rigs that do nothing except mine currencies. Because of mine Dogecoin in your mobile cost involved, mining has become completely impractical for hobbyists and general consumers.Anyway, that's enough on mine Dogecoin in your mobile history lesson. If you follow any crypto news at all, you've likely seen a lot of reports on a little digital asset known as Dogecoin. With its signature Shiba Inu mascot, Doge was created in 2013 by a couple of software engineers as somewhat of a joke. The goal was to create a coin that was more accessible to mine Dogecoin in your mobile masses with faster transaction times and lower fees than Bitcoin. Until recently, Doge has been worth less than a penny and yet, it has a massive \\u2013 almost cult-like \\u2013 following on mine Dogecoin in your mobile internet. As of late, more and more big names have jumped on mine Dogecoin in your mobile Dogecoin bandwagon and mine Dogecoin in your mobile broader acknowledgments from major companies, expanded listing on major exchanges and billionaires like Elon Musk heralding mine Dogecoin in your mobile coin have driven mine Dogecoin in your mobile price of Doge to record highs. In mine Dogecoin in your mobile past year, Dogecoin has risen an astounding 24,000% from a fraction of a penny to over $0.60 per coin. Like Bitcoin, Doge is mined mostly by miners and farms with hardware designed solely for this purpose. However, there are still some that mine from home using gaming PCs or GPU rigs in mine Dogecoin in your mobile hopes of cashing in on mine Dogecoin in your mobile Doge phenomenon. This has led me to a user request asking if it is possible to mine Doge (or other cryptos) on a Chromebook.  Mining Crypto on Chrome OS  If you take a quick poke around mine Dogecoin in your mobile web, you'll find that most agree that mining cryptocurrency with a CPU-only PC is 100% unprofitable and, for mine Dogecoin in your mobile most part, they're right. There are some altcoins out there that can still be mined with a CPU and with some luck, you might make enough to pay for your week's coffee but don't hold your breath. Still, you know me. I'm willing to give anything Chrome OS-related a try just to say I did it. So, I found a Linux-based mining software that installs easily on Chrome OS and I gave it a try. If you're a tinkerer like me and you want to give it a go, here's how you can actually mine Dogecoin on a Chromebook or Chrome OS device that has Linux app support.There are numerous miners out there that will work on Ubuntu and Debian systems. Some have graphical interfaces and that does make it easier for mine Dogecoin in your mobile beginning users. However, mine Dogecoin in your mobile Linux container on Chrome OS often struggles using GUI apps because of mine Dogecoin in your mobile nature of mine Dogecoin in your mobile container and VM it uses. Plus, a GUI takes up CPU power and you want all mine Dogecoin in your mobile power you can get for your mining software. For this, we are going to use a CLI miner that runs in mine Dogecoin in your mobile terminal and you can track mine Dogecoin in your mobile progress on mine Dogecoin in your mobile back end of mine Dogecoin in your mobile mining pool where you and other miners pool PC power to mine blocks and gain rewards in Dogecoin. This particular miner is built off of mine Dogecoin in your mobile cpuminer-multi used by many CPU miners for a wide variety of coins. I found that it requires mine Dogecoin in your mobile least amount of hoops to get up and running on Chrome OS and it only takes a few commands to get started. Once installed, we'll look at how to start and monitor your miner.  Before you get started with mining, you'll need a place to store your earnings. For this, you need a wallet. There are many types of wallets out there. Some can be installed locally on your machine while others can be used on mobile devices. There are multi-wallets that can be used to store, exchange, and even purchase various cryptocurrencies and there are wallets specific to Dogecoin only. The one you choose is up to you but for this experiment, I chose to go with mine Dogecoin in your mobile online Doge wallet from http://Block.io because it is fully encrypted and you can access it anywhere that you can get online. Also, mine Dogecoin in your mobile wallet isn't custodial. You own mine Dogecoin in your mobile coin and you alone have access to your privately encrypted wallet. To set up a new Doge wallet, head over to Dogechain and create a new one. Be sure to save your private wallet ID and password somewhere offline for security's sake. Once you've set up your new wallet, navigate to mine Dogecoin in your mobile receive tab and get your unique Dogecoin address. You will need this for mine Dogecoin in your mobile miner's script. Don't worry about mine Dogecoin in your mobile safety of mine Dogecoin in your mobile address. Crypto addresses are generally used for only sending or receiving, not both. No one can access your funds or your wallet with this receiving address. On to mine Dogecoin in your mobile miner.  To get started, you will need to make sure your device is set up and ready to use Linux applications. You can learn more about that in this getting started article here. Up to date? Great. Here we go. Before you install mine Dogecoin in your mobile miner, you will need to download a couple of dependencies not present in Debian 10 by default. These are simply Linux packages that are used to compile and build other packages. You can install them all at once by pasting mine Dogecoin in your mobile following command in your Linux terminal and hitting enter. At mine Dogecoin in your mobile prompt, press y or simply hit enter to confirm mine Dogecoin in your mobile installation.  That's it. Your CPU miner is now ready to run. Keep in mind, this is going to put mine Dogecoin in your mobile spurs to your CPU and all or your cores will likely be maxed out while mine Dogecoin in your mobile miner is running. Don't plan on using your device for anything else while mine Dogecoin in your mobile cpuminer is running and you should also be aware that this will be very taxing on your hardware. The CPUs are going to run hot and long-term use of this miner could result in damage to your device. This is just an experiment. If you don't feel comfortable with it or don't know how to manage your thermals, DON'T DO IT. Okay, that's out of mine Dogecoin in your mobile way. To start your miner, you should be in mine Dogecoin in your mobile cpuminer-opt folder. If not, use mine Dogecoin in your mobile cd command to get there. There are a number of pools where you can mine Doge or mine other coins that can be automatically converted to Dogecoin. We're going to use Zpool because it is easy to use and you don't have to create an account to hook your miner up and monitor your mining. To get your miner started, run mine Dogecoin in your mobile following command replacing wallet address with mine Dogecoin in your mobile receiving address you created for your Dogecoin wallet.There you go. You will be able to see your current hash rate and accepted shares in mine Dogecoin in your mobile terminal. To keep an eye on your earnings (which will be very little) you can paste your wallet address into Zpool for real-time stats. I fired up this miner on a Core i5 Chromebox with 8GB of RAM right before I started writing this post. In roughly two hours, I have earned about .016 Doge or roughly one cent. Needless to say, a Chrome OS device shouldn't be your first pick if you're looking at getting into mining crypto at home. Maybe mine Dogecoin in your mobile Tiger Lake devices on mine Dogecoin in your mobile way can leverage some GPU power and do a bit better but I'd guess it won't be worth mine Dogecoin in your mobile price of mine Dogecoin in your mobile hardware or mine Dogecoin in your mobile electricity it takes to mine. I'm not here to give investment advice and I'm certainly not telling you to purchase cryptocurrencies. However, if you are wanting to hop on mine Dogecoin in your mobile Doge train, you will be better served to purchase some coin from a trusted exchange like Binance. If you already own some digital currency and you want to swap it out, you can quickly exchange a number of major cryptocurrencies for little more than mine Dogecoin in your mobile network fee at ChangeNOW and you'll have your Doge in just a couple of hours. For all you Shibes out there, see you on mine Dogecoin in your mobile moon.  At this point, we've virtually all heard about Bitcoin, one of several cryptocurrencies that are nowadays commonplace within mine Dogecoin in your mobile world belonging to mine Dogecoin in your mobile web.

Due to mine Dogecoin in your mobile cost for you, mining has become completely impractical for hobbyists in addition to widespread consumers.Anyway, that is enough on mine Dogecoin in your mobile history lesson. Any time you stick to some crypto news flash at all, you have likely viewed a great deal of reports on somewhat digital resource known as Dogecoin. With its signature Shiba Inu mascot, Doge was invented in 2013 by a few of an application engineers as a little bit of a laugh. The aim was to create a coin which was much more handy for mine Dogecoin in your mobile masses with faster transaction situations and lower fees in comparison with Bitcoin. Until not too long ago, Doge is really worth less money than a penny but yet, it has a tremendous - almost cult-like - adopting on mine Dogecoin in your mobile net. As of late, more plus more big names have jumped on mine Dogecoin in your mobile Dogecoin camp as well as mine Dogecoin in your mobile broader acknowledgments via major businesses, expanded listing on huge switches as well as billionaires like Elon Musk heralding mine Dogecoin in your mobile coin have pushed mine Dogecoin in your mobile price of Doge to capture highs. In mine Dogecoin in your mobile past 12 months, Dogecoin has risen a fantastic 24,000 % grown in a tiny proportion of a penny to over $0.60 per coin. As with Bitcoin, Doge is mined largely by miners and also farms with hardware developed primarily for this particular job. Nevertheless, right now there are still several that mine from house using gaming PCs or maybe GPU rigs within mine Dogecoin in your mobile hopes of cashing in on mine Dogecoin in your mobile Doge occurrence. This has led me to a person inquire asking whether it's feasible to mine Doge (or perhaps additional cryptos) on a Chromebook.  Advancement in mobile technology has made it easier to perform various tasks straight from our phones. Though mobile phones can be used to perform many functions, Bitcoin mining is proving a complex function in mine Dogecoin in your mobile technology ecosystem. The complexity associated with Bitcoin mining raises questions on whether mining Bitcoins via mobile devices is possible.

These increase their chances of getting mine Dogecoin in your mobile best out of Bitcoin mining. Traditionally, cryptocurrency mining focuses on validating transactions on mine Dogecoin in your mobile blockchain through complex computing systems. This implies using a computer processor that needs a significant amount of energy to execute its functions effectively.  To raise miners' chances of solving complex mathematical problems and winning impressive rewards, developers have designed tailor-made mining software to increase Bitcoin mining profitability.  Mobile mining  Typically, mobile mining is pretty mine Dogecoin in your mobile same though mine Dogecoin in your mobile mining is considered low scale.

What does this mean to you?  The rewards are shared across mine Dogecoin in your mobile pool depending on mine Dogecoin in your mobile amount of power shared with miners. This means as other serious miners receive better rewards, you only get little compared to mine Dogecoin in your mobile power you are contributing to mine Dogecoin in your mobile network. These are some of mine Dogecoin in your mobile downsides associated with mobile mining.  Which are preferable smartphones for mining?  When choosing mine Dogecoin in your mobile most appropriate hardware for Bitcoin mining, you should opt to go for Altcoins rather than trying out with Bitcoin. Given mine Dogecoin in your mobile big number of experienced miners in mine Dogecoin in your mobile crypto ecosystem, operating in a smaller market segment may increase your chances of getting mine Dogecoin in your mobile best out of Bitcoins.  To mine cryptocurrency, you need to have an android smartphone at least. This is because it has mine Dogecoin in your mobile most suitable mining-friendly operating system to facilitate Bitcoin mining.  The mobile market is already flooded with various apps designed for android that you can use to mine Bitcoin directly from your home. The main downside is that most of mine Dogecoin in your mobile Apps cannot be found on mine Dogecoin in your mobile Google play store. This follows a move by Google to ban all mining apps sighting harmful effects they have on devices.  Lower device performance, overheating, and battery damage are some of mine Dogecoin in your mobile negative effects of mining cryptocurrency through mobile phones. Further, Apple also banned mining apps from their mining store. This means owners of iOS devices can not mine through their apple devices.  The current Apple guidelines for delivers have now prohibited Mac Apps and ios from virtual mining currency from mine Dogecoin in your mobile background. Generally, mine Dogecoin in your mobile revelations are a big blow to cryptocurrency miners who may be interested in mining straight from their mobile devices. The measure was put in place to protect mine Dogecoin in your mobile integrity of Apple hardware.  In case you are a die-hard Bitcoin mining enthusiast, you can as well launch mine Dogecoin in your mobile following apps on your smartphone to hit mine Dogecoin in your mobile road on your Bitcoin mining journey.  MinerGate Mobile miner  This is one of mine Dogecoin in your mobile key bitcoin Apps that enables you to mine altcoins and Bitcoins. The App features an inbuilt wallet where users store their coins.  Bitcoin miner  Bitcoin miner is a common App compatible with most smartphone devices. The App has a seamless user interface .mine Dogecoin in your mobile unique aspect about this App is that besides Bitcoins, it supports altcoins' mining.  Conclusion  Bitcoin mobile mining is not complicated as people may think. All a miner needs is to install a mining App on a smartphone from bitcoinscycle. Upon launching mine Dogecoin in your mobile App on your phone, it enables you to mine in mine Dogecoin in your mobile background as you use your smartphone for other activities.  The worst undoing about mining apps is that they are likely to damage your device. Eventually, what you may have thought would help you generate some income will result in unnecessary expenses.  On mine Dogecoin in your mobile flip side, no matter how expensive your mobile device can be, mine Dogecoin in your mobile damage likely to be caused through mining may not be covered by what you will get out of mine Dogecoin in your mobile process.You may have heard about mining cryptocurrencies with your smartphone, but perhaps you don't know where to start or whether mine Dogecoin in your mobile returns are worth mine Dogecoin in your mobile effort.  Here's what you need to know about cryptocurrency mobile mining.  Is cryptocurrency mobile mining really possible?  Cryptocurrency mobile mining is possible, but it comes with a long list of reasons not to do it. Moreover, mining on your smartphone doesn't even come close to traditional mining hardware or software. In mine Dogecoin in your mobile current state of cryptocurrency mining, doing it on your smartphone might not bring you enough profits to be worth mine Dogecoin in your mobile time and effort.  It's not because mine Dogecoin in your mobile smartphones we have today aren't powerful enough to be used for cryptocurrency mining. The main point is that mine Dogecoin in your mobile tools that other miners use for mining are way more powerful. This means that they have higher chances of winning mine Dogecoin in your mobile incentives.  As you may have learnt by now, regular cryptocurrency mining implies validating transactions on mine Dogecoin in your mobile blockchain by solving complex mathematical problems. This process uses your computer processor or your GPU power and consumes a significant amount of energy.  Cryptocurrency mining has become more of an industrial activity. Developers created software specifically for mining, miners began to invest in ASIC mining devices that increased profitability, and pool mining was invented. All these innovations aim to gather more computing power to raise miners' chances of solving mine Dogecoin in your mobile algorithms and getting rewards.  Cryptocurrency mobile mining is pretty much mine Dogecoin in your mobile same but on an infinitely smaller scale. No one will stop you from using your smartphone to join a mining pool or a mobile mining farm. However, mine Dogecoin in your mobile power you share with your network is practically insignificant when compared with other miners. So, when mine Dogecoin in your mobile network shares rewards, you'll only receive mine Dogecoin in your mobile percentage that is related to your computing power.  Which smartphones can be used for mining?  When you consider mine Dogecoin in your mobile hardware requests for cryptocurrency mining, it's usually wiser to go for altcoins instead of experimenting with Bitcoin. Given mine Dogecoin in your mobile high number of professional miners out there, operating in a smaller market may help you to monetise your investment faster."}, {"upvote": 34, "content": "It rewards you with BTCs, the Satoshi Unit of Bitcoin.

Decentralization is the most important aspect of a blockchain.  I always knew why certain blockchains were centralized or not, but I never thought of putting it into a simple ranking. I will do this now.  For every person that tells me that XRP is so decentralized, because they read this scam article, The Inherently Decentralized Nature of XRP Ledger | Ripple,  [ https://ripple.com/insights/the-inherently-decentralized-nature-of-xrp-ledger/ ]I will point them to this article where they can see why XRP is the 4th most centralized blockchain.  Let's start with the most centralized blockchains and go to the most decentralized blockchains.  C-Tier - Blockchains with absolutely terrible decentralization.  1. NEO, which is only run by 7 nodes of which 5 are owned by NEO [ https://neo.org/consensus ], and it is permissioned and non-trustless 2. Icon, which is run by 6 nodes and it is permissioned and non-trustless 3. WTC, which is run by 6 nodes and it is permissioned and non-trustless 4. EOS, which is run by 21 nodes and is permissioned and non-trustless 5. Tron, originally a PoS blockchain, became the worst version of itself. If they simply stayed a classic PoS where around 100 entities hold 51% of the voting power and would have been happy with 1,500 TPS that a classic PoS blockchain can do, then it would be a top 10 blockchain in terms of decentralization and scalability. However, no they had to make the mistake that all the not so intelligent blockchain leader make. Sacrificing all of their decentralization for some more scalability.   Now, Tron is governed by 27 super representatives, which opens a myriad of attack vectors including social engineering, phising, blackmail, coercion and cartel formation, just like in EOS. Also, all super representatives have to identify themselves, this makes it extremely easy to attack them with all the above mentioned attack vectors. Furthermore, more than 51% of the token supply are within 3 entities. The first 3 entities here TRON BlockChain Explorer [ https://tronscan.org/#/ ] already have 20% and then the Tron foundation has locked up 33% of the token supply in 1,000 addresses [ https://tronscan.org/#/blockchain/foundation ] that they control, adding up to 53% of the tokens controlled by 4 entities.   These attacks are already starting to happen. Tron is already riddled with vote buying. Read more here: The trials of Tron [ https://decryptmedia.com/4336/the-trials-of-tron ] 6. Ark, which is run by 51 nodes and is permissioned and non-trustless 7. Lisk, which is run by 101 nodes and is permissioned and non-trustless 8. VeChain with their Proof of Authority algorithm, which is heavily permissioned and non-trustless 9. Nuls with their Proof of Credits algorithm, which is permissioned and non-trustless B-Tier - Blockchains with bad decentralization.  1. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Monero, Verge because 51% of their hashing power is controlled by 2 entities, Bitmain and another pool. However, this provides a bit more decentralization than Masternodes, since it is not completely centralized with mining pools.  However, they are permissionless and trustless. 2. Dash, which is controlled by 3 mining pools [ https://coinfoundry.org/pool/dash ], though with its 5,000 Masternodes [ https://chainz.cryptoid.info/dash/masternodes.dws ], it's slightly better than generic PoW coins. 3. Digibyte is a PoW blockchain that is controlled by 5 mining pools. [ https://chainz.cryptoid.info/dgb/#!extraction ] Additionally, it has several mining algorithms, which is better than just one. This puts it slightly ahead of all other PoW coins. However, it still suffers from mining pool centralization and doesn't seem to offer any solution for that. 4. Hashgraph, which is trustless, but also permissioned, because its governance is dictated by a board of 39 people and they decide what dapps and structures will be allowed or not based on their interest. 5. Stellar, which is permissionless, though non-trustless, and 80% of the supply is owned by Stellar [ https://www.stellar.org/stats/ ], which puts 1 entity in control while it has 60 known nodes [ https://dashboard.stellar.org/ ] and 250 total nodes [ https://stellarbeat.io/ ]. However, those nodes are put into quorum slices, so there are probably only around 10 quorum slices that vote. If anyone has information on that let me know, I didn't find more info on that. 6. XRP, which is run by 120 validating nodes  [ https://minivalist.cinn.app/ ]and which is permissionless, but not trustless. Furthermore, 52% of the supply is locked up by Ripple, which puts 1 entity in control. Finally, only only 6 accounts own [ https://ledger.exposed/rich-stats#range ] more than 51% of the circulating supply again. However, with XRP holding funds doesn't add to control, so it's not that important. A-Tier - Blockchains with ok decentralization.  1. Nano, which is controlled by 6 entities, which have more than 51% Nanode \\u00b7 Representatives [ https://www.nanode.co/representatives ], but which is trustless and permissionless. Another flaw with Nano is that it doesn't have dapps or smart contracts. 2. Cardano, which is controlled by 70 nodes and possibly 20 entities. Rich List - Cardano Block Explorer [ https://adatracker.com/richest ]. Cardano is also permissionless and trustless 3. Decred with their hybrid PoW/PoS consensus algorithm that is also permissionless and trustless S-Tier - Blockchains with excellent decentralization.  All of those are permissionless and trustless.  1. Tezos, which has liquid dPoS and constantly changes voting nodes 2. IOTA, which is controlled by millions of entities, but only at scale. Any new users will add a new node and vote and infinitely increase decentralization for each new node. 3. Holochain, which is built to be controlled by millions of entities. Any new users will add a new node and vote and infinitely increase decentralization for each new node. 4. Quarkchain, which uses Sharding for consensus, which is excellent decentralization, excellent scalability and also permissionless and trustless. 5. Zilliqa, which uses Sharding for consensus, which is excellent decentralization, excellent scalability and also permissionless and trustless. 6. Elastos, which is built to be controlled to by millions of entities, depending on the number of side-chains and number of nodes in those chains and infinitely increase decentralization for each new node. Conclusion  The C-Tier blockchains are pretty much worthless, because they suffer from the worst centralization. There is no point to use their blockchain and they could also use a server for their transaction with no difference in security. Tron, Stellar and XRP take the cake by having 1 entity in control.  The B-Tier blockchains are also bad. They are definitely not decentralized.  The A-Tier blockchains have ok decentralization, but they still have only 50 entities that control them. What makes them A-Tier is that they are permissionless and trustless. If you are permissioned or non-trustless, you can never be A-Tier.  The S-Tier blockchains have outstanding decentralization. They are designed to be controlled by at least millions of nodes and they are obviously also completely permissionless and trustless. If you are permissioned or non-trustless, you can never be S-Tier.  Tezos, IOTA (at scale), Holochain, Elastos are the only ones who have outstanding decentralization.  However, Tezos completely missed also focusing on scalability. That's why they can only do 300 TPS, while IOTA, Holochain and Elastos can do millions to billions of TPS.

Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at Oanda Asia Pacific Pte., a platform for trading traditional currencies, is quoted as saying: \\u2018Dogecoin has no apparent commercial or investment use other than as a conduit for speculative mania and the attempt to make a buck. I suspect much of its appeal lies in the fact that it is very, very cheap to buy and sell, as opposed to $60,000 for Bitcoin, making it much more approachable to a retail trader who fancies a flutter.'  Firstly, If you are new to Cryptocurrency and you are looking for the best place to invest, I will recommend CryptoFXnetwork Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www . cryptofxnetwork . com) as it is relatively new (launched at mid-summer 2018) but has become the largest cryptocurrency Investment Platform there is right now (total volume over 4 billion dollars) where you start getting returns of your invested cryptocurrency after 10 days. Supports variety of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin and other Altcoin. I find that it has a really nice UI and support.  NOTE: I recommend the consultation of a financial professional who would have a perfect knowledge of the financial and patrimonial situation of the recipient of this message and would be able to verify that the financial products mentioned are adapted to the said situation and the financial objectives pursued. This above mentioned is based on my own experience dealing with CryptoFXnetwork.  The low nominal price may have a psychological effect on investors like \\u2018penny stocks' do, but whether you put $1,000 in Dogecoin or Bitcoin, you are risking the same amount. Curtis Ting, managing director for Europe at crypto exchange Kraken, suggests that investors buy Dogecoin for the memes as much as for the money, stating: \\u2018investors buy Dogecoin to participate in a self-deprecating joke about their inability to invest wisely, which keeps going as the price of an individual Dogecoin continues to appreciate.'  The huge fluctuations in price look a lot like a \\u2018pump and dump' scheme, where users jack up the price by focusing attention on a cheap asset, encouraging investors to buy and then dumping the coin and leaving behind the investors who are too slow or not savvy enough. Further, the ownerships of Dogecoin seems to be concentrated in relatively few anonymous hands, so it may not take much to get the price moving in either direction.  The future  What the future holds for Dogecoin, never mind other cryptocurrencies, is a guessing game. The big problem with the cryptocurrency space is the polarisation of opinion \\u2013 commentators, bloggers and YouTubers are either crypto haters or \\u2018moonboys' (believing that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will go to the moon).  But the uptick in attention is part of a wider phenomenon of investors piling into speculative assets. Soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 G\\u00e9n\\u00e9rale SA's global head of quantitative strategy, Andrew Lapthorne, has cited Dogecoin as an example of \\u2018an increasingly large number of weird and wonderful signs of market excess.' Indeed, over 50 meme cryptocurrencies are now listed on CoinMarketCap, documenting their rise to prominence.  Like all cryptocurrencies, the greatest inhibitor to its growth is the inability to use it for transactions. Yet the specific issue for meme cryptocurrencies, as opposed to other cryptocurrencies, is that their usage relies somewhat on users being attracted to the meme. If investors lose interest in the meme, then the price will collapse and Dogecoin will be worthless.

It received support from a worldwide community on Reddit following the influential KOLs on their expectations for the Shiba Inu.  No whitepaper, no technology highlights, only a meme of Shiba Inu and a group of a jeering crowd, dogecoin unsurprisingly received little reactions among geeks and traditional investors, but was rather warmly embraced by newbies to crypto investment.  If one has invested $5000 in Dogecoin back in January, the initial investment would now be worth around $500,000. Its excellent performance in price rallies, community discussions, and mainstream focuses pushed it to the top position among other altcoins. Up till today Doge's total trading volume has exceeded $12 billion, with an estimated overall worth of more than $60 billion \\u2014 making it bigger than Tether, Ford, and Twitter.  However, meme coins are extremely volatile, and prices often are closely tied to influencers pumping excitement for them. Joey Montoya is one of the investors that still hold on to dogecoin and is confident of a continued rise. He is an audio engineering student in Arizona, began buying dogecoin in December 2020, and a high-risk taker that are willing to share with others that he has seen a 200% return at that time.  Doge holders share one common point, they are extremely open to emergent opportunities under volatile markets. They believe that the crowd's power will continue to push it to the skyline.  The more people that adopt the currency and the more people that are using it, the more valuable it is, and that's why it's not too late, Montoya said.  Doge is far beyond pure investment assets  Dogecoin has been attracting huge attention after it found favour with retail investors and won over high-profile fans including rapper Snoop Dogg and the Kiss bassist Gene Simmons.  The Dogecoin community are extremely united, mostly on Reddit. They've banded together to support and raise money for their own, including donating to people who lost theirs in a hack in 2013, or used it to raise money to build a well in Kenya in 2014. They even raised enough Doge to sponsor the 2014 Jamaican Bobsled Team and Indian Olympic luger Shiva Keshavan.  Advice before You Buy Doge  The price of cryptocurrencies can change on a sec-to-sec basis. Some of the factors that may influence the price of DOGE:   * Current Total supply: The total supply of DOGE is diminishing quickly due to its popularity, despite 10,000 DOGE are minted with every block (around 1 minute).  * Current financial conditions: As the speed of price surge in Bitcoin is slowing down, fresh investments will flood into altcoins. As an increasing number of investors are worried about the decline of the bull market, fast money will rush into the top altcoin that has the highest consensus among communities.  * KOL influences: Retail investors regard KOL opinions as a key indicator for cryptocurrency purchase, especially when talking about meme coins. For instance, as Vitalik Buterin donated Shiba Inu tokens sent to his public wallet by the creators of SHIB, ELON, AKITA , mwDOGE, OSHIB, their market price were shaken with a plunge.

This gives Dogecoin the following 5 big fundamentals that no other cryptocurrency has.  1. It has the most brand recognition in the crypto industry next to Bitcoin. It might consistently gain more brand recognition than Bitcoin soon if Bitcoin keeps declining 2. The world's richest man loves DOGE so much and has probably hundreds of millions of dollars in Dogecoin. He will make sure that it pumps again. It is also tied to his reputation and brand, so the success of Dogecoin is in the very high interest of Elon Musk. 3. Dogecoin has captured the spirit of cryptocurrency that doesn't follow norms and disrupts finance as we know it 4. Dogecoin will be in the history books and be taught in businsess schools as a case study about marketing, branding & Co. for centuries as one of the biggest movements that revolutionized finance this century 5. Everytime crypto is mentioned, there will always be a referance to Dogecoin Dogecoin is possibly the most amazing marketing case-study and marketing success story in the history of marketing.  So, to answer your question How good is Dogecoin cryptocurrency?  It is one of the best and is at the level of Bitcoin and Ethereum and probably the second-best investment in the Top 10 after Ethereum.  Ethereum is safer and Dogecoin is more speculative and more high risk of course, but it can possibly give a bigger return.  The good thing about Dogecoin is that people have zero expectations. Instead it is powered by the huge meme economy. This means DOGE is powered by the entire Generation Y and Z. This is so big and no other coin has this kind of support.  At the same time, for other Top 10 coins like Polkadot, BNB they have massive expectations and need to deliver greatly if they want to grow while Dogecoin simply has to say  That's the power of the meme-economy."}, {"upvote": 93, "content": "Dogecoin just had a large impulse upward, forming what is likely the pole of a bull flag that will consolidate for some time before another leg up.

Thank me later.  The next big thing  Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency [ https://www.cnet.com/news/blockchain-explained-builds-trust-when-you-need-it-most/ ], a form of digital money that, much like bitcoin [ https://www.cnet.com/tags/bitcoin/ ], enables peer-to-peer transactions across a decentralized network. One important difference: bitcoin is the original blockchain proof-of-concept. Bitcoin is ground-breaking. Bitcoin is (some believe) world-changing tech with the potential to transform how money works in the 21st century.  Dogecoin is a digital coin with a picture of dog on it.  \\\"It is a puzzle to me why Dogecoin is so highly valued,\\\" says Adrian Lee, a senior finance lecturer at the University of Technology in Sydney.  At one point Dogecoin was worth $2 billion. It's difficult to make sense of that.  \\\"Dogecoin is an easily replicable coin,\\\" Lee said. \\\"I don't know how it distinguishes itself from Bitcoin. I really think it has to do with being established early.  \\\"And also the dog.\\\"  If you've spent any time on the internet during the last decade, you've probably heard of the Doge meme [ http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doge ]. The iconic Shibe, his inner monologue expressed in comic sans with broken modifiers: \\\"so scare,\\\" \\\"much noble,\\\" \\\"wow.\\\"  At the peak of the meme's popularity near the tail end of 2013, Palmer, an Australian marketer for one of the world's largest tech companies, made a joke combining two of the internet's most talked-about topics: cryptocurrency and Doge. It was a joke taking aim at the bizarre world of crypto and bitcoin's multiple derivatives.  \\\"Investing in Dogecoin,\\\" Palmer tweeted, \\\"pretty sure it's the next big thing.\\\"  The tweet got a lot of attention.  For laughs, Palmer decided to keep the joke going. He bought the Dogecoin [ http://Dogecoin.com ] domain and uploaded a photoshopped Shibe on a coin.  He left a note on the site: If you want to make Dogecoin a reality, get in touch.  Animal Crossing, featuring the in-game currency \\\"Bells\\\".Nintendo  The bell tolls  On the other side of the world, Billy Markus, a video game-obsessed software engineer at IBM [ https://www.cnet.com/tags/ibm/ ], saw Palmer's note. He'd just finished \\\"Bells\\\", a project he was working on in his spare time.  Bells was a cryptocurrency named after money used in the Nintendo [ https://www.cnet.com/tags/nintendo/ ] game Animal Crossing. It was 2013, the original crypto gold rush. Markus saw that bitcoin's code was open-source. He decided to take a weekend and do something weird. He tried to create his own cryptocurrency for \\\"sillies,\\\" as he put it.  Bells was weird as hell. The major difference between Bells and regular cryptocurrencies was the rewards: they were completely random. If you mined bitcoin, using a decently powerful home computer, the rewards were consistent.  CNET DAILY NEWS  Stay in the know. Get the latest tech stories from CNET News every weekday.  SIGN ME UP!

And that's because Bells wasn't meant to be serious, it was a digital currency based on a video game about animals who live in a village and go fishing together.  The cryptocurrency community didn't really get the joke.  \\\"People were just trashing it,\\\" laughs Markus, who quickly discovered there was very little crossover between crypto-obsessives and gamers.  \\\"I was like alright, I retire,\\\" says Markus. \\\"I don't need to do this anymore.\\\"  But then Markus read Palmer's message on Dogecoin [ http://Dogecoin.com ]. That was the moment Billy Markus decided to come out of crypto retirement.  Ctrl+F bitcoin  When Palmer didn't immediately respond to Markus' offer to help build Dogecoin, he started working on it anyway.  \\\"Dogecoin,\\\" says Markus, \\\"from 'that seems like it's funny' to actually doing it, took about three hours. It's almost trivial to create a new cryptocurrency.\\\"  It was a find-and-replace job.  Ctrl+F 'Bitcoin,' replace with 'Dogecoin.'  Markus freely admits to finding large chunks of bitcoin's source code completely incomprehensible, but knew enough to change a few core elements for Dogecoin. For example, Markus created 100 billion dogecoins (as opposed to bitcoin's 21 million) and made them easier to mine. (Dogecoin is already close to being mined out, while bitcoin's final coin will be mined in 2140.)  He changed the font (to comic sans of course) and changed every mention of the word 'mine' to 'dig' (because dogs don't mine, they dig...).  And then, during his lunch break, Markus set Dogecoin live.  Moving at light speed  Premining: the act of gathering cryptocurrency before launching your coin into the public domain. Almost everyone serious about launching a cryptocurrency does this.  But Markus and Palmer didn't premine any Dogecoin. Because they weren't serious about launching a cryptocurrency.  \\\"We thought it was this big joke that would die off,\\\" laughs Palmer.  And according to Markus, Palmer wasn't even sure how to mine a cryptocurrency.  Markus had a relatively powerful gaming [ https://www.cnet.com/games/ ] PC, with two graphics cards, so he was officially the first person to mine Dogecoin. But given the the nature of mining (which gets increasingly difficult as the currency is mined) Billy's computer was no longer powerful enough to mine Dogecoin after about five minutes. Markus split what he'd mined 50-50 with Palmer and that was that. Both got about $5,000 of Dogecoin.  And that's all the Dogecoin either man would ever own.  In online crypto circles, Dogecoin became popular very quickly. Forum threads moved rapidly. The name Dogecoin echoed throughout dark corners of the internet.  But Reddit [ https://www.cnet.com/tags/reddit/ ] was almost certainly the main driver in Dogecoin's rapid rise to crypto stardom. The Dogecoin subreddit exploded almost immediately, and with that explosion came the infrastructure any cryptocurrency needs if it is to become successful: mining pools, services.  \\\"It was moving at light speed,\\\" explains Markus. \\\"Within minutes we were like, 'Wow, this is way out of our control.\\\"  But it was the Reddit \\\"tipping bot\\\" that drove Dogecoin into the stratosphere.  If a user posted something to the effect of, \\\"hey 'dogebot' tip this person five dogecoin,\\\" that Reddit user would automatically receive five Dogecoin. People were sending Dogecoin back and forth in a feel-good exercise that cost very little money in real-world terms.  \\\"I liked it,\\\" says Markus. \\\"At the time, Dogecoin wasn't worth anything, but getting five Dogecoin felt better than getting two cents.\\\"  Reddit users were sharing Dogecoin back and forth constantly, which expanded the user base of Dogecoin and, as a result, increased its value as a cryptocurrency.  \\\"Pretty much everyone who used Reddit had Dogecoin,\\\" says Palmer. \\\"I think that was key to its success.\\\"  The 2014 Jamaican bobsled team, holding Dogecoin t-shirts.Crowdtilt  A force for good  January 2014. Jackson Palmer is already three drinks deep at a trivia night at his local pub in Sydney. His phone starts buzzing. It doesn't stop buzzing.  Earlier that night, Palmer and the Dogecoin community had brainstormed a ridiculous (but completely brilliant) idea.  For the first time in a decade, Jamaica's bobsled team had qualified for the Winter Olympics, but it didn't have enough money to attend. As huge fans of the comedy \\\"Cool Runnings [ http://www.metacritic.com/movie/cool-runnings ],\\\" Palmer and the Dogecoin crew decided to do something about it.  They chucked up a Dogecoin address onto the subreddit and asked for donations. Hours later they'd raised $25,000.  That's when Palmer's phone started vibrating off the hook.  \\\"I was like, 'Quick we need to get back to our computers,'\\\" laughs Palmer.  So Palmer and friends stumbled home from the pub, picked up a six-pack of beer for good measure and set about figuring out how to send 26 million Dogecoins to the Jamaican bobsled team.  It was a gesture that symbolized the early spirit of Dogecoin.  In Markus' words, they were allergic to the word \\\"invest.\\\" Both Palmer and Markus donated all their Dogecoin to these massive charity initiatives. They helped build water wells in Kenya and raised money to help train assistance dogs for autistic children.  \\\"We wanted to create something that was a force for good,\\\" explains Palmer.  But as the community grew, the initial spirit in which Dogecoin was launched was difficult to preserve. People started to care about the price of Dogecoin. They were literally and figuratively invested in it.  And that terrified Markus.  \\\"I don't mind if someone spends ten bucks and gets some Dogecoin,\\\" says Markus. \\\"It's like buying a movie ticket or something, that's fun.  \\\"But when someone puts $20,000 in? That makes me really, really uncomfortable.\\\"  Markus began clashing with members of the community. For him, Dogecoin was still crypto \\\"for sillies,\\\" but here it was ballooning into a currency people were trading for real money. In his view Dogecoin was a silly thing that should remain silly. Many in the community disagreed.  Eventually he decided enough was enough.  \\\"I was like, \\\"Okay, this is dumb. I don't want to be the leader of a cult.\\\"\\\"  Markus decided to bail on Dogecoin.  Moolah  It was Moolah that pushed Dogecoin to the brink.  Palmer describes it as \\\"PayPal for cryptocurrency.\\\" From the very beginning, Palmer was cynical.  Run by a British man calling himself Alex Green, Moolah was a cryptocurrency exchange designed to help people buy and sell Dogecoin. They infiltrated the Dogecoin community with startling efficiency.  Alex Green began by doling out Dogecoin in exchange for upvotes on the Dogecoin subreddit. He also donated generously to charitable causes the community were involved in, like $2,500 to a cancer charity, or $3,000 to help get the Dogecoin Nascar vehicle on the track.  The community loved it. Soon Moolah began hiring people from the Dogecoin community for key positions in the company.  \\\"Alex Green started building his business on top of Dogecoin,\\\" says Palmer.  Markus, watching from afar, wasn't a fan.  Despite removing himself from the day-to-day workings of Dogecoin, Markus attended a Dogecoin convention, organized in part by Palmer. He wanted to catch up with some of the old gang. By chance, he ran into representatives from Moolah, who were at the bar guzzling Cristal at $200 a bottle. They poured a glass for Markus.  \\\"I was really uncomfortable,\\\" remembers Markus. \\\"I said, 'whatever's going on here I just don't want any part of it.'\\\"  \\\"I just passed the glass to someone else.\\\"  Many key figures in the Dogecoin community shared Markus' suspicions, particularly Palmer, who was wary of Moolah from the beginning. But when concerns were raised they were mostly shouted down by a community that enjoyed the free currency being sent their way.  Later Moolah began soliciting the Dogecoin community for investment dollars and plenty donated Dogecoin to the cause. Why not? Moolah had been generous in the past. It made sense to repay the favor.  Moolah received over $300,000 from the Dogecoin community, across three separate rounds of investment.  And then it all came crashing down.  Months later, October 2014, Moolah went completely bankrupt. The Dogecoin community would end up losing every single cent they'd invested.  The situation got worse. An ex-girlfriend of Green got in contact with Palmer and other members of the Dogecoin community. She revealed that Green was actually Ryan Kennedy, who was notorious in the UK anime community for running companies terrifyingly similar to Moolah.  Suddenly the UK police were involved. After a three-year investigation, Kennedy faces multiple charges of fraud and money laundering. At a preliminary hearing in Bristol Crown Court  [ https://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/news/bath-news/former-bath-resident-ryan-kennedy-465560 ]on September 2017 he denied all charges. A request for comment was sent to Kennedy's Defence Lawyer, but we've yet to receive a response.  But Kennedy had to answer to more serious, disturbing crimes. In May 2016, he was tried and convicted on three counts of rape with three separate women [ http://blog.cps.gov.uk/2016/05/ryan-kennedy-convicted-of-three-counts-of-rape-against-three-women.html ]. According to press reports he smiled as he was being led from court [ http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3724522/Vicious-sex-fiend-emotionally-controlled-three-women-raped-jailed-11-years.html ].  \\\"Ryan Kennedy convinced his victims they had no choice but to do as they were told,\\\" said senior prosecutor Ben Samples. \\\"He was emotionally, sexually and physically abusive, putting his needs above all else.\\\"  Ryan Kennedy is currently serving an 11-year sentence in a UK prison.  Remember this moment  In the months after Moolah's bankruptcy, Palmer struggled. He distanced himself from Dogecoin. From the community. From cryptocurrency as a whole.  \\\"The energy I was putting into it wasn't helping me from a mental health perspective,\\\" he explains.  The famous Dogecoin. Much cryptocurrency.Dogecoin  Like Markus, Palmer decided to bail on Dogecoin.  Palmer has re-emerged on the cryptocurrency scene. He now runs his own YouTube channel [ https://www.youtube.com/JacksonPalmer ]. He has no interest in launching another cryptocurrency and has little to do with Dogecoin. He calls himself a crypto skeptic. \\\"Cryptocurrency is a solution in search of a problem,\\\" he says.  What problem did Dogecoin solve?  \\\"I don't think it solves anything,\\\" he says. \\\"If anything, it exists as an educational tool. It's a reminder that we can't take this stuff seriously.  \\\"I hope people see Dogecoin and say, I'm not going to put all my money into this. Because right now there's a dog on a coin and it's worth half a billion dollars.\\\"  Outside of the occasional donation, neither Palmer or Markus owns any significant amount of Dogecoin.  Back in January 2014, Markus posted a message on the Dogecoin subreddit; an ode to the community and what it had achieved. One year later, in the wake of the Moolah disaster, it had been reposted. An attempt to recapture the spirit in which Dogecoin had been founded.  It was a timely reminder of what had been lost.  \\\"I have no way of knowing how transient this all may be,\\\" Markus wrote of Dogecoin, two months after creating it.  He wrote about how proud he was -- of the community, of the money they'd raised for various good causes. He thanked everyone for the incredible amount of work they'd put in.  \\\"I would like everyone to remember this moment,\\\" he said. \\\"My hope is that Dogecoin will always be remembered fondly.\\\""}, {"upvote": 129, "content": "Like all cryptocurrencies, Doge has no fundamental value, and some argue it has no reason to have any. Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at Oanda Asia Pacific Pte., a platform for trading traditional currencies, is quoted as saying: \\u2018Dogecoin has no apparent commercial or investment use other than as a conduit for speculative mania and the attempt to make a buck. I suspect much of its appeal lies in the fact that it is very, very cheap to buy and sell, as opposed to $60,000 for Bitcoin, making it much more approachable to a retail trader who fancies a flutter.'

This above mentioned is based on my own experience dealing with CryptoFXnetwork.  The low nominal price may have a psychological effect on investors like \\u2018penny stocks' do, but whether you put $1,000 in Dogecoin or Bitcoin, you are risking the same amount. Curtis Ting, managing director for Europe at crypto exchange Kraken, suggests that investors buy Dogecoin for the memes as much as for the money, stating: \\u2018investors buy Dogecoin to participate in a self-deprecating joke about their inability to invest wisely, which keeps going as the price of an individual Dogecoin continues to appreciate.'  The huge fluctuations in price look a lot like a \\u2018pump and dump' scheme, where users jack up the price by focusing attention on a cheap asset, encouraging investors to buy and then dumping the coin and leaving behind the investors who are too slow or not savvy enough. Further, the ownerships of Dogecoin seems to be concentrated in relatively few anonymous hands, so it may not take much to get the price moving in either direction.  The future  What the future holds for Dogecoin, never mind other cryptocurrencies, is a guessing game. The big problem with the cryptocurrency space is the polarisation of opinion \\u2013 commentators, bloggers and YouTubers are either crypto haters or \\u2018moonboys' (believing that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will go to the moon).  But the uptick in attention is part of a wider phenomenon of investors piling into speculative assets. Soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 G\\u00e9n\\u00e9rale SA's global head of quantitative strategy, Andrew Lapthorne, has cited Dogecoin as an example of \\u2018an increasingly large number of weird and wonderful signs of market excess.' Indeed, over 50 meme cryptocurrencies are now listed on CoinMarketCap, documenting their rise to prominence.  Like all cryptocurrencies, the greatest inhibitor to its growth is the inability to use it for transactions. Yet the specific issue for meme cryptocurrencies, as opposed to other cryptocurrencies, is that their usage relies somewhat on users being attracted to the meme. If investors lose interest in the meme, then the price will collapse and Dogecoin will be worthless.

It received support from a worldwide community on Reddit following the influential KOLs on their expectations for the Shiba Inu.  No whitepaper, no technology highlights, only a meme of Shiba Inu and a group of a jeering crowd, dogecoin unsurprisingly received little reactions among geeks and traditional investors, but was rather warmly embraced by newbies to crypto investment.  If one has invested $5000 in Dogecoin back in January, the initial investment would now be worth around $500,000. Its excellent performance in price rallies, community discussions, and mainstream focuses pushed it to the top position among other altcoins. Up till today Doge's total trading volume has exceeded $12 billion, with an estimated overall worth of more than $60 billion \\u2014 making it bigger than Tether, Ford, and Twitter.  However, meme coins are extremely volatile, and prices often are closely tied to influencers pumping excitement for them. Joey Montoya is one of the investors that still hold on to dogecoin and is confident of a continued rise. He is an audio engineering student in Arizona, began buying dogecoin in December 2020, and a high-risk taker that are willing to share with others that he has seen a 200% return at that time.  Doge holders share one common point, they are extremely open to emergent opportunities under volatile markets. They believe that the crowd's power will continue to push it to the skyline.  The more people that adopt the currency and the more people that are using it, the more valuable it is, and that's why it's not too late, Montoya said.  Doge is far beyond pure investment assets  Dogecoin has been attracting huge attention after it found favour with retail investors and won over high-profile fans including rapper Snoop Dogg and the Kiss bassist Gene Simmons.  The Dogecoin community are extremely united, mostly on Reddit. They've banded together to support and raise money for their own, including donating to people who lost theirs in a hack in 2013, or used it to raise money to build a well in Kenya in 2014. They even raised enough Doge to sponsor the 2014 Jamaican Bobsled Team and Indian Olympic luger Shiva Keshavan.  Advice before You Buy Doge  The price of cryptocurrencies can change on a sec-to-sec basis. Some of the factors that may influence the price of DOGE:   * Current Total supply: The total supply of DOGE is diminishing quickly due to its popularity, despite 10,000 DOGE are minted with every block (around 1 minute).  * Current financial conditions: As the speed of price surge in Bitcoin is slowing down, fresh investments will flood into altcoins. As an increasing number of investors are worried about the decline of the bull market, fast money will rush into the top altcoin that has the highest consensus among communities.  * KOL influences: Retail investors regard KOL opinions as a key indicator for cryptocurrency purchase, especially when talking about meme coins. For instance, as Vitalik Buterin donated Shiba Inu tokens sent to his public wallet by the creators of SHIB, ELON, AKITA , mwDOGE, OSHIB, their market price were shaken with a plunge.

Source:  https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=bitcoin,dogecoin,ethereum Dogecoin was also one of the best performing cryptocurrencies in this bull run with a performance of 15,000% since last July!  This gives Dogecoin the following 5 big fundamentals that no other cryptocurrency has.  1. It has the most brand recognition in the crypto industry next to Bitcoin. It might consistently gain more brand recognition than Bitcoin soon if Bitcoin keeps declining 2. The world's richest man loves DOGE so much and has probably hundreds of millions of dollars in Dogecoin. He will make sure that it pumps again. It is also tied to his reputation and brand, so the success of Dogecoin is in the very high interest of Elon Musk. 3. Dogecoin has captured the spirit of cryptocurrency that doesn't follow norms and disrupts finance as we know it 4. Dogecoin will be in the history books and be taught in businsess schools as a case study about marketing, branding & Co. for centuries as one of the biggest movements that revolutionized finance this century 5. Everytime crypto is mentioned, there will always be a referance to Dogecoin Dogecoin is possibly the most amazing marketing case-study and marketing success story in the history of marketing.  So, to answer your question How good is Dogecoin cryptocurrency?  It is one of the best and is at the level of Bitcoin and Ethereum and probably the second-best investment in the Top 10 after Ethereum.  Ethereum is safer and Dogecoin is more speculative and more high risk of course, but it can possibly give a bigger return.  The good thing about Dogecoin is that people have zero expectations. Instead it is powered by the huge meme economy. This means DOGE is powered by the entire Generation Y and Z. This is so big and no other coin has this kind of support.  At the same time, for other Top 10 coins like Polkadot, BNB they have massive expectations and need to deliver greatly if they want to grow while Dogecoin simply has to say  That's the power of the meme-economy."}, {"upvote": 10, "content": "I think yes. Here are some potential signs of this shift from low-value meme to potential medium of exchange:  1. It is retaining value despite the crypto roller-coaster  That Dogecoin continues to trade far above its early 2021 price range of $0.02 or less suggests that market forces have established a \\\"floor\\\" at current levels, at least for the time being. The coin's worth never fell far below $0.30 during the past month, despite China's push to ban cryptocurrency mining. That decision came as a blow to Bitcoin miners in particular, since 65% of them are believed to operate in China, but the decision exerted downward pressure on the whole crypto market.  2. It has some everyday advantages over Bitcoin  Among the younger demographic that makes up the bulk of cryptocurrency enthusiasts, preserving the environment is commonly seen as a high priority.  In light of that, the vastly lower amount of electricity required to mine and use Dogecoin compared to Bitcoin could boost its attractiveness as a crypto alternative. Dogecoin uses just 0.12 kilowatt-hours of electricity per transaction, compared to Bitcoin's 707 kilowatt-hours.  Though the concept is currently little more than an upbeat prospectus, the nonprofit VeriBlock Foundation says it is working on a \\\"proof-of-proof\\\" blockchain technology that would reuse Bitcoin's proof-of-work security for other cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin. If successfully deployed, the technology could greatly lower Bitcoin's relative environmental costs, while providing improved security for other cryptocurrencies, potentially helping Bitcoin and Dogecoin develop a type of symbiosis rather than a direct rivalry, benefiting holders of both.  While some view with concern the fact that there is no limit on the total number of Dogecoin that could eventually be mined -- in contrast to Bitcoin, which does have a hard cap -- a maximum of 5.26 billion additional Dogecoin tokens can be mined per year. With over 129 billion coins already in circulation, this capped mining rate ensures Dogecoin's inflation rate will decline steadily over time, while still providing an incentive to continue mining it.  The total number of Dogecoin in circulation will rise by 4.1% in 2021, but only 3.9% in 2022. Dogecoin inflation will be 3.5% in 2025, 3.0% by 2030, 2.3% by 2040, and 1.9% by 2048. Given the attrition from lost Dogecoin wallets -- a factor in the supply of all cryptocurrencies -- the coin could theoretically become deflationary at some point if those losses exceed the ever-shrinking inflation provided via mining.  In short, while Dogecoin is theoretically \\\"infinitely inflationary,\\\" its predictably declining, mathematically inevitable inflation rate potentially gives it more a stable value than national currencies.  3. It's gradually winning wider acceptance  Like any currency, Dogecoin gains value as it becomes more widely accepted as a medium of exchange. While dozens of small businesses now accept Dogecoin as a form of payment, their economic impact is effectively zero. However, some larger entities are also accepting Doge, including the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, which will let customers use it to buy both tickets and merchandise through BitPay.  As team owner Mark Cuban stated: \\\"The Mavericks have decided to accept Dogecoin as payment for Mavs tickets and merchandise for one very important, earth shattering reason, because we can!\\\" The team's press release offered some more practical reasons for the decision, noting that the \\\"ability to accept crypto expands a business' sales opportunity into international markets where accepting credit cards is not practical while reducing high fees and increasing payment transparency and efficiency.\\\" The Houston Rockets are also accepting Dogecoin, among other cryptocurrencies.  It is now also possible to purchase the hardest of hard assets, precious metals, using Dogecoin. The largest U.S. silver and gold e-commerce site, JM Bullion, added it to the list of seven cryptocurrencies it accepts as payment. Under JM Bullion's policy, buyers using cryptocurrencies receive a 3% discount on their transactions compared to credit card purchases, close to the 4% discount it offers to purchasers who pay via personal check.  Rumors also continue to swirl that so-called \\\"DogeFather\\\" Elon Musk might start accepting the cryptocurrency for purchases of Tesla vehicles. The electric car manufacturer has stopped accepting Bitcoin payments due to the coin's adverse environmental impact, but Musk continues to offer verbal support for Dogecoin. However, with Musk now signaling that he'd be willing to reverse his Bitcoin rejection if miners commit to \\\"going green,\\\" Tesla's future stance on Dogecoin remains cloudy."}, {"upvote": 5, "content": "What are some cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin?"}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/Why-are-useless-cryptocurrencies-like-Shiba-Inu-and-Dogecoin-so-popular", "question": "Why are useless cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin so popular", "answers": [{"upvote": 1, "content": "Hopium  h\\u014d-p\\u0113-\\u0259m  (noun)  an addictive narcotic drug that consists of hopeful thoughts and interacts with human emotions as a catalyst, inducing similar to the psychological effects of playing the lottery.

There have been a variety of factors at play that have made this crypto popular. Most of these factors are sociological and not technological\\u2026 but network effect is King in the world of cryptocurrency.  1. The first memecoin. It came out in December 2013 and it clearly started as a joke. It's symbol is the Doge and the tokenomics are outrageous. And that is what gave it charm. Over the course of nearly 10 years it's had time for a loyal community to band around it. 2. Easy to mine. Dogecoin has always been a relatively easy coin to mine. It can be done with GPU mining and has a similar protocol to Litecoin. It never required a warehouse like Bitcoin (until now possibly). 3. Reddit. If you want to laugh at some memes join the Dogecoin community. They've had a good time since 2013. This is where the loyal strength of the community comes from. 4. Exchanges. Dogecoin can be found just about anywhere\\u2026 and that was before the token's value shot to the moon. It can be found on: Binance, Coinbase, Huobi, Kucoin, FTX, Gate.io, Gemini, Kraken and Abra just to name a few. It's not hard to find Dogecoin. You can even trade it on Robinhood! 5. Elon Musk. Elon Musk is the secret sauce that took Dogecoin to the moon. When he tweeted about $Doge it created a sensation that went viral. The coin went from being worth about 1 penny to almost 75 cents in just a few months. Long time Doge holders who bought in years prior saw even bigger gains. Some bought in under $0.001! Doggy millionaires were made! 6. Long term. The biggest complaint about Dogecoin has been its lack of development. The good news is that the Doge Foundation seems to be picking up steam with the influence of Elon Musk and Vitalik Buterin. Will the software improve? Only time will tell.

There is no such thing as a useless crypto currency because they all have a vision and a strategy. Behind each coin, developers and founders present detailed blueprints and white papers. The majority of them have solid plans for the future, as well as relationships with some of the market's biggest names.  Every day, we see several memes on social media; how wonderful would it be to own some stacks of those memes and have some value in them? Founders are doing just that right now. All of these are referred to as meme coins. The key to all the fame and hysteria is heavy marketing. Extension work and effort are placed into the currency's marketing to improve awareness among potential investors.  Partnerships are another important factor. Founders strive to form partnerships with well-known companies in order to boost demand for their coin. Shiba Inu recently teamed with AMC Theatres, and AMC Theatres will now accept Shiba Inu coins as a form of payment.

Otherwise, it's nothing more than a vehicle for supposition. Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have both suffered in this arena, owing primarily to their inefficiency and high transaction costs as payment systems, but also to their extreme volatility.  A business cannot accept payments in a currency that has the potential to fall by more than 70% in a short period of time since it undermines all assurance regarding cash flow. Not to mention that such a drop would wipe out the merchant's income from the sale of its goods and services. Similarly, consumers would be unable to trace their purchasing power on any given day, rendering the token practically useless as a currency.This has major ramifications. Cryptocurrency exchanges, like stock exchanges, would have to register with the SEC and be subject to a number of limitations to avoid market manipulation. They would also be expected to keep detailed records of all trades and to adhere to stringent audit and compliance standards. In this case, cryptocurrency investors' days of anonymity would be virtually ended.  But, in any event, it's possible that this may happen shortly.

While some cryptocurrencies have ventured into the physical world with credit cards or other projects, the large majority remain entirely intangible. The crypto in cryptocurrencies refers to complicated cryptography which allows for a particular digital token to be generated, stored, and transacted securely and, typically, anonymously. Alongside this important crypto feature of these currencies is a common commitment to decentralization; cryptocurrencies are typically developed as code by teams who build in mechanisms for issuance (often, although not always, through a process called mining) and other controls.

However, both tokens have demonstrated their ability to undergo significant price rallies - and both came from relative obscurity to nudging their way into the top ten cryptocurrencies in 2021.  As a self-confessed meme coin, it's probably fair to say that Shiba Inu presents the riskier investment. Its price will largely be determined by the proactiveness of the various online communities. However, the platform's innovations and quirky branding have so far proved a hit with younger crypto-enthusiasts.  If we look at the price forecasts for SHIB and LUNA, then we see a similar story for both. Most platforms are predicting growth of anywhere between 30% and 50% for the coming years, but it's also true that most foresee some fairly significant volatility on the horizon.  So which is the better investment? This one could come down to your personal opinion and investment strategy. Whilst community price runs can be remarkable, they are never guaranteed and Shiba Inu has yet to establish itself as a viable form of digital payment in the same way that Terra Luna has managed to do.

An intergalactic tax war was therefore started by the two powers at be in 2089.  Rent and basic living costs are very expensive on Mars.

In spite of their reputation for creating price hikes, the lead up to the halving has witnessed a 25 percent decline in valuation over the last month.  What is halving?  Halving is a process that occurs when the mining reward for a cryptocurrency is reduced by 50%. Miners receive crypto rewards for solving problems that create each new block on a given blockchain. The rewards differ for each cryptocurrency. With Litecoin, miners are currently awarded 25 coins per block. After Aug 5, miners will only receive 12.5 Litecoins per block.  A lot of people do not know there are so many ways to earn cryptocurrencies by investing legitimately in platforms like www.coastminers.tech where they can get double of their investment in 7 days without losing them(thank me later).  Litecoin rewards halve every 840,000 blocks, a process that occurs every four years. The block speed for Litecoin is roughly 2.5 minutes, with around 576 blocks generated per day. One of the key factors to take into account is that, according to the coding behind cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin, only a certain amount will ever be mined. This distinct characteristic sets it apart from fiat currencies, which can theoretically be printed infinitely.  Although it's difficult to say when the final Litecoins will be mined, the Litecoin Foundation estimates that it will be around 2142, when the maximum of 84 million Litecoins will be reached. As of press time, there are 62,983,450 Litecoins in circulation, representing 74.93% of all Litecoins that will ever be mined. This leaves roughly 21 million coins left to be mined up until 2142. Comparatively, it's estimated that the final few Bitcoins (BTC) will be mined around 2140.  Halvings are closely followed by investors, as the consequent reduction in mining rewards affects the profitability. Accordingly, this has a knock-on effect on the price. For investors, this can be a mixed bag. According to the theory of supply and demand, halvings should drive up the price of the cryptocurrency. As they receive fewer coins per block solved, miners stop producing them until the work once again becomes profitable. As fewer coins enter circulation, the price consequently goes up, as demand \\u2014 in theory \\u2014 will overtake the supply. Although this sounds like a sure-fire win for investors, halvings can bring about even greater instability to an already volatile market.  Previous halvings have stoked investor interest, and the upcoming Litecoin event is no exception. According to Google Trends, searches for Litecoin halving peaked between June 9 and June 15, although data shows that this trend is once again increasing.  Searches for Bitcoin halving on Google are typically more numerous than entries for Litecoin, although this trend has reversed as of July 30.  What could happen?  In the time leading up to the halving, miners ramp up operations to maximize their returns until the whole process becomes unprofitable. Miners need to invest in powerful, specialized equipment to take on the computing challenges required for creating blocks. As the difficulty of mining blocks rises, so do electricity costs. Mining is no longer a game for individual hobbyists, with even the biggest mining farms struggling to remain profitable during the so-called crypto winter of 2018. Mining is now a big business, and businesses need to make a profit. So, when profitability falls, activities tend to cease.  The fact that miners will feel the heat after the halving is no secret, with Litecoin creator Charlie Lee predicting that many will shut up shop after Aug 5. Lee told Australian crypto news site Mickey that halving the block rewards by 50% always has an impact on the Litecoin mining ecosystem:   %3E When the mining rewards get cut in half, some miners will not be profitable and they will shut off their machine. If a big percentage does that, then blocks will slow down for some time. For litecoin it's three and a half days before the next change, so possibly like seven days of slower blocks, and then after that, the difficulty will readjust and everything will be fine. Despite the commonly accepted theory that a decrease in supply results in a corresponding increase in demand, Lee suggested that market sentiment also plays a role in ramping up the price:   %3E In terms of the price, the halvening should be priced in because everyone knows about it since the beginning. But the thing is people kind of expect the price to go up. So a lot of people are buying in because they expect the price to go up and that's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy. So, because they're buying in, the price does actually go up. After Litecoin's 2015 halving, the coin peaked in July of that year before losing nearly 50% of its value by the time of the reward reduction, culminating in a decrease of 75% in the aftermath, Mickey reports. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarketsFX, told Cointelegraph via email that reducing block rewards for miners is an effective filtering process and agreed that the effect on the price is usually positive:   %3E Reducing the incentive for miners is good for LTC because only serious people will remain in the space. As for the price action, it is difficult and it depends a lot on the sentiment but usually this kind of action is positive for the price. If the price bombs following the halving, the network hash rate will tail off as mining begins to shut down, leaving only the largest mining farms operational. Once the hash rate drops below a certain point, the mining difficulty will adjust itself and smaller miners may be able to begin mining once again.  Supply and demand: Experts weigh in  Although halving events are widely considered to result in a price hike for the given cryptocurrency, market experts do not foresee any dramatic changes in valuation. Mati Greenspan, a senior market analyst at eToro, told Cointelegraph that halving events are usually priced in before they actually happen:   %3E It seems to be the case here as well. Litecoin has outperformed the rest of the market during this year's rally and some say that it was a root cause of the upward momentum in the first half of this year. It's difficult to say how or even if the price will react to the event in the short term. In the long term, reduced supply supports higher prices all else being equal. Renowned crypto trader and technical analyst Crypto Rand also agreed in email conversations with Cointelegraph that the halving event has already been priced in:   %3E I don't think the halving event will have much impact on Litecoin price, it's already priced in since one month I would say. LTC is looking pretty solid here. It just broke up the local downtrend channel after bouncing on the key $88 range support. If the downtrend of volume finally comes to an end I'm expecting a rise on the price back to $105-$110. Right now looks like a solid option among the rest of big caps. For Aslam, those trying to jump on the halving gravy train are already too late:   %3E The most important factor to remember is that these kind of planned events are already fully priced in and traders have already positioned themselves for this. Running up to the event, it is not usually wise to participate in that move because you are already too late for the party. Therefore, smart money always buy the rumour and sell the news. Greenspan predicts that there won't be many surprises in mining activity, due in part to Litecoin's scrypt algorithm:   %3E Litecoin's scrypt algorithm is pretty unique so the hardware used to mine it is not easily adaptable to mining other tokens. Therefore it doesn't have quite the same of competition over hashrate that some of the other cons have. My feeling is that LTC miners have had ample time to prepare for the halving so we shouldn't see any major changes. When asked about what investors holding LTC should be doing, Greenspan had advice:   %3E Holding. But more importantly spending. Litecoin's value proposition specifically involves being a more durable token for making payments. The more people use it for this purpose, the stronger the network gets. Some members of the crypto community are commenting that the Litecoin halving can be viewed as a test run for the upcoming midyear 2020 BTC halving and that we can consequently expect similar results. For Greenspan, the comparison is sound, although he warned that results will not be identical:   %3E The market has matured a lot since the last Bitcoin and Litecoin halvings. Though we couldn't possibly expect a mirror reaction, the LTC halving should give us some indication of what to expect when BTC does the same next year. Crypto Rand is not so sure, however, stating that investor understanding and even awareness of Litecoin juxtaposed to Bitcoin is incomparable:   %3E I don't think LTC halving can work as test for Bitcoin, I would say 95% of the traders/investors are not aware of the halving on LTC or they don't know what means. The coverage for BTC it's and will be a fully mainstream event, everyone will be aware of it. Strix Leviathan says halving profits are a myth  A blog post published on July 21 by institutional-grade algorithmic investment management platform Strix Leviathan reported that cryptocurrencies do not outperform the market in the months leading up to and following block reward reductions.  The report found that the supply and demand theory, while certainly feasible as a logical theory, does not result in a rapid increase in price. Per the report, Strix Leviathan analysts found that LTC outperformed the market twice prior to a reduction in block rewards, yet fell to the bottom 25% of the market in the ensuing six-month period. The report also postulates that the performance of a crypto asset both in and out of halving periods are more or less the same:   %3E What we find is that the return distribution of an asset's halving periods versus the return distribution outside of its halving periods reveals that they are statistically the same at a 99% confidence level. In other words, we did not find evidence that a halving event results in abnormal pricing action and we are dealing with a circumstantial illusion. It appears more likely that the return behavior before, during, and after a halving coincides more with increasing levels of speculation than with an underlying shift in sell side pressure. Merged mining could mitigate block reward reductions  A report published by binance Research, an arm of major crypto exchange Binance, found that the impact of halvings for both BTC and LTC miners could be mitigated by merged mining. Binance researchers analyzed Charlie Lee's prediction that many miners would have to halt operations and looked into how merged mining could help keep miners on-board even after rewards have been reduced.  Merged mining uses the work done on a parent blockchain and spreads it across other smaller child blockchains by using auxiliary proof-of-work (AuxPoW). The three most prominent examples of merged mining are the Litecoin-merged Namecoin (NMC), Bitcoin-merged Dogecoin (DOGE) and Myriadcoin (XMY), a cryptocurrency merged with both BTC and LTC.  The report theorized that merged mining could help mitigate the impact of reward reductions by future block rewards scheduled for both Litecoin and Bitcoin. Binance researchers also reported that smaller chains could incorporate AuxPoW in future to support greater network security and reduce the need for an independent mining operation. The report did, however, find some potential shortcomings. Researchers said that miners may not turn to merged mining due to the risk of operational costs when supporting child blockchains and potential declines in the market price.  The report cites Dogecoin as the most successful examples of merged mining, which adopted the model in August 2014. After the switch, the coin's mining hash rate skyrocketed 1,500%. The report also found that, as of July 2019, 90% of Dogecoin's total hash rate is sourced from Litecoin mining pools"}, {"upvote": 93, "content": "Dogecoin just had a large impulse upward, forming what is likely the pole of a bull flag that will consolidate for some time before another leg up.

By that time, there should be more clear choices for winners in the crypto arms race, and either Dogecoin falls out of favor or starts to approach the promised land of nearly $1 per coin."}, {"upvote": 3, "content": "Let's look at the price graph for the last three month:  The currency was worth $0.008 back in January of 2021 and then it gained to about $0.07 in a very short time. That is basically an 8x gain in value. In April the price went to about $0.30 which is another 5x gain in value. Overall the price of Dogecoin went about 37x from its average in January.  The traditional investing pattern would suggest this is some sort of pump and dump if this was a price movement of a penny stock. In the case of Dogecoin, we know what happened. Elon Musk basically made some meme-related posts about it and it propelled the currency up with many day traders buying it with a belief that they will be able to get out in time if it drops. In that sense, this was a classic pump but this is not a nefarious illegal sort of pump and dump because Elon as far as we know it did not make a big investment in the currency only to dump it for a profit which would be illegal.  The fact that Dogecoin has maintained the $0.3 level value for six days now is already pretty incredible in its own right. The people who day traded it for a quick sensible profit have probably long exited their position by now. So the question should be as to who is buying and selling right now?  Who is buying?  1. People who feel the currency is fairly priced if Elon Musk continues to support it. These folks feel Elon Musk has some sort of plan that he has not announced yet. Perhaps he is waiting for some technical indicator before he makes his next move. He has the power to convince the board of Tesla to allow acceptance of Dogecoin as payment to purchase cars which would be a huge benefit to the currency. The marketing of the currency gives it a value of its own. 2. People who feel the currency may have some staying power. Perhaps it can maintain its status of major cryptocurrency if the meme nature of it continues or some more celebrities join in on the joke or simply that many more people start using it for everyday things. Perhaps the incredible rise will encourage the community to continue to advance the currency on technical levels. Who is selling?  1. People who don't agree with the people who are buying. They don't think the currency has any staying power and they think this is a dilutional fantasy that it could somehow get to $1 if enough people make meme posts about it. 2. Most importantly the people who are long-term holders of a lot of the currency that was mined early on. These are the so-called whales. These folks have come into incredible wealth basically by luck. It is like a thousand people all of a sudden won the jackpot in the lottery on the same day. Do you think a lot of them won't be heading to the cash register? Let's say someone had a million Dogecoins in their wallet and they pretty much forgot about it for years. Now, this is worth like $1M all of a sudden. I think anyone rational would be crazy to not at least cash in half to pay off a mortgage or student loans and secure their financial independence. The super whales who have so much dogecoin they have become wealthy beyond most people's imagination should at least know if they try to sell it all at once on public exchange it would crash the price so perhaps they are not so selfish as to do that. By the way, the point about whales selling now is actually a great thing for cryptocurrency's health. This may suck for anyone who FOMOed into buying it at $0.42 as they are down about 20% right now but it is a great thing for Dogecoin as a whole. Elon Musk hinted that he liked to see whales divest of some of their holdings in Dogecoin in order for him to seriously back it. Maybe some of them are doing that right now and simply following his advice. If that is the case there can be some long-term upside to Dogecoin. It matters that asset like cryptocurrency is widely owned and used in order to it to maintain it's value.  Also, I like to note that the mainstream media is busy writing all sorts of Dogecoin is in a bubble and warning newbie investors how careful they should be. I get what they are doing but writing over-the-top headlines is a bit too much. Every new investor should know that buying Dogecoin at these historically high prices is very risky and there is a good chance of downside in the short term but there are some chances of an upside as well so buying it is not totally irrational.  Disclaimer. Personally, I have a positive bias towards Dogecoin because of simply human phycology. I happen to have mined a little bit of it in 2014 as an experiment without having any hope of it gaining much value in the future. I was pleasantly surprised by its rise in price making me an accidental Dogecoin winner. I feel sort of like I won the lottery but got the lower value lottery ticker with fewer numbers guessed.

Dogecoin was one of the standout performers in the cryptocurrency market during 2021, peaking in May before gradually descending in the following months.

My Forecast,  End of 2022 \\u2013 Although Dogecoin's value has decreased significantly over the past eight months, the coin still benefits from incredible backing from social media communities.

With bitcoin struggling to maintain gains above $8,000, investors may continue to pour money into altcoins. Litecoin, in particular, could shine bright over the next few weeks, as the mining reward halvingis now less than 90 days away.  On Aug. 6, the reward for mining coins on litecoin's blockchain will drop from current 25 LTC to 12.5 LTC. The process, aimed at curbing inflation, is repeated every four years and markets tend to price in the supply-altering event well in advance, according to historical data.  LTC/USD and LTC/BTC daily charts  LTC/USD (above left) jumped above $100 earlier today, as expected, having witnessed a falling wedge last month and an inverse head-and-shoulders breakout on May 14.  The bullish price action is accompanied again by an overbought reading an (above-70 reading) on the relative strength index (RSI).  However, with reward halving due in less than three months, pullbacks, if any, will likely end up fueling stronger price rallies toward $155, which is the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from December 2017 highs to December 2018 lows.  The bullish view would be invalidated if LTC violates the current higher lows, higher highs pattern on the RSI with a move below 68.83. That could happen if bitcoin falls sharply toward $5,000.

Dogecoin is a highly-risky memecoin with little real-world utility. It neither has the pedigree of Bitcoin nor the utility of a crypto like ETH. Like other cryptocurrencies, the price of Dogecoin is very volatile and can soar or crash simply based on one or two tweets (as Elon Musk showed us).  While quite a few people have made money off of trading Dogecoin, many of these people are simply speculators who got lucky (I'm sure there are a few smart traders who knew what they were doing, but these are probably the minority).  In contrast, stablecoins are intended to 100% track the price of a fiat currency such as the U.S. dollar, with the safest stablecoins, like USD Coin (USDC) reportedly being 100% backed by U.S. dollars and U.S. Treasury bonds.

However, most crypto experts agree that Dogecoin is not a good long-term investment option due to a number of reasons. Doge is an inflationary coin, meaning it has an endless supply that keeps growing more and more rapidly as time goes. Every year, more than 4 Billion Dogecoin are mined and added to the overall supply. In the long term, this makes Doge unstable for long term investment, unlike deflationary coins like Bitcoin, which has a high demand and a limited supply.  No way it can be stable under these circumstances, certainly not now."}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "Search  3 Reasons Dogecoin Could Head to the Moon  1. It is retaining value despite the crypto roller-coaster  Cryptocurrencies in general have taken a pummeling over the past several weeks, and Dogecoin has not been immune from that trend. Its value often moved independently from Bitcoin or even the crypto market as a whole during its ascent, and its price has hovered in the $0.30 to $0.40 range for nearly a week. This stability has come despite the average size of trades and the overall trading volume dropping sharply. The average transaction value, which shot upward starting in mid-April, peaked at $1.16 million on May 23, then fell back to less than $240,000 by May 26, according to data supplied by BitInfoCharts.  That Dogecoin continues to trade far above its early 2021 price range of $0.02 or less suggests that market forces have established a \\\"floor\\\" at current levels, at least for the time being. The coin's worth never fell far below $0.30 during the past month, despite China's push to ban cryptocurrency mining. That decision came as a blow to Bitcoin miners in particular, since 65% of them are believed to operate in China, but the decision exerted downward pressure on the whole crypto market.  2. It has some everyday advantages over Bitcoin  Among the younger demographic that makes up the bulk of cryptocurrency enthusiasts, preserving the environment is commonly seen as a high priority.  In light of that, the vastly lower amount of electricity required to mine and use Dogecoin compared to Bitcoin could boost its attractiveness as a crypto alternative. Dogecoin uses just 0.12 kilowatt-hours of electricity per transaction, compared to Bitcoin's 707 kilowatt-hours.  Though the concept is currently little more than an upbeat prospectus, the nonprofit VeriBlock Foundation says it is working on a \\\"proof-of-proof\\\" blockchain technology that would reuse Bitcoin's proof-of-work security for other cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin. If successfully deployed, the technology could greatly lower Bitcoin's relative environmental costs, while providing improved security for other cryptocurrencies, potentially helping Bitcoin and Dogecoin develop a type of symbiosis rather than a direct rivalry, benefiting holders of both.  3. It's gradually winning wider acceptance  Like any currency, Dogecoin gains value as it becomes more widely accepted as a medium of exchange. While dozens of small businesses now accept Dogecoin as a form of payment, their economic impact is effectively zero. However, some larger entities are also accepting Doge, including the NBA's Dallas Mavericks, which will let customers use it to buy both tickets and merchandise through BitPay.  It is now also possible to purchase the hardest of hard assets, precious metals, using Dogecoin. The largest U.S. silver and gold e-commerce site, JM Bullion, added it to the list of seven cryptocurrencies it accepts as payment. Under JM Bullion's policy, buyers using cryptocurrencies receive a 3% discount on their transactions compared to credit card purchases, close to the 4% discount it offers to purchasers who pay via personal check."}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "No, unless there are some drastic changes in direction.

Dogecoin faces these challenges to a much greater degree than many of its rivals.  Secondly, Built-in-dilution.  Unlike bitcoin, which has built-in scarcity with a finite supply of 21 million coins, Dogecoin is inflationary. There are currently 132 billion units in circulation, according to data from Cryptocurrency Prices, Charts And Market Capitalizations | CoinMarketCap.  And that number will expand by 5 billion annually forever. This dilution makes Dogecoin unsuitable as a long-term store of value, because the more coins in circulation, the less each is worth.

Then, in 1193 CE, Enrico Dandolo, the Doge of Venice, introduced a new coin known as the grosso. This new coin, which originally weighed a total of 2.18 grams, was 98.5% silver and was valued equivalent to twenty-six denarii. As a result of its remarkable purity, the coin soon became widely preferred among merchants and it became an important trade currency.  The obverse of the coin depicts the Doge himself receiving a banner from Saint Mark the Evangelist, the patron saint of the Republic of Venice. The reverse of the coin depicts Christ Pantokrator enthroned.  Venetian grossos are now collected by coin collectors around the world. Like most medieval silver coins of this level of purity, however, they are very expensive. Moreover, collecting medieval coins is also fraught with thorny issues of provenance and the legality of medieval coin collecting in some jurisdictions may be open to question. Finally, buying one of the Doge's coins probably will not benefit you materially and the only reason to buy one is really for the mere sake of having it.

Dogecoin was created by software engineer Billy Markus in only 3 hours. After copying and pasting Bitcoin\\u2018s core code, Markus spent the bulk of that time making alterations to the client to make the text Comic Sans.  Markus will be the first to admit that Dogecoin was created as a joke. He even sold his entire position in 2015 just to buy a used Honda Civic. As of May 4, Dogecoin has surpassed a $75 billion market cap. That's a lot of Civics.  Is it too late to board the Dogecoin rocketship, or will Elon have a few extra Falcon 9s to spare for the journey? Well, That is my job here. My job is to let you know it's never too late!! In fact, You'd still be an early bird if you purchase Doge now.  While I am by no means an expert on fundamental analysis, anyone who's ever copy-pasted anything online can tell you that this task is likely not worth $75 billion. Just like Bitcoin and the US dollar, the price of Dogecoin is only worth what someone else is willing to pay for it. And for some reason, people are willing to pay a lot for the Shiba Inu, meme coin.  To find out why we turn to Richard Dawkins 1976 book, The Selfish Gene, where the word meme was coined. The new soup is the soup of human culture. We need a name for the new replicator, a noun which conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation.  If you're a zoomer or a millennial with a Robinhood account, odds are you already own a chunk of DOGE larger than any financial advisor on the face of the earth would recommend, and you've also probably already made a higher yield on it than those advisors will make in the next decade on their stock portfolios. Give yourself a pat on the back, you've earned it.  An investment in Dogecoin is not about making money (although it may happen accidentally) it's about being a part of something bigger.  The retail investor is no longer an individual. They're a team, and Doge is their mascot \\u2013 at $0.01 or $1. If you've decided to throw away some of your money in exchange for being a part of a revolution, here's how you can do it.  Dogecoin is not supported by Coinbase or Gemini, however you can pick it up on Robinhood, Binance and Kraken.  A $75 billion dollar meme tends to shake traditional investors to their core. It even scares many away from cryptocurrency altogether. While many see this as a market top indicator, it looks to me like a bull flag.  In 2017, the biggest concern facing Bitcoin was it's viability for everyday use. No stores accepted it as payment (except a few really, really smart ones) and the average person still thought Bitcoin was magic internet money.  Now the narrative has changed, and Dogecoin has had a significant impact in cryptocurrency adoption as a whole. Gone are the days of boring CDs and treasury bonds from grandma. The new generation speaks in memes on their iPads from the age of 3, and their finances ought to reflect that.  Dogecoin introduced the millionaires and billionaires of the future to a technology they didn't know (and may still not realize) they wanted, blockchain.  If the growth of blockchain and Bitcoin truly follow Metcalfe's law (as they appear to do so far), then widespread adoption through any channel is not only a good thing, but ideal.

The joke crypto, the world's most valuable joke, the meme cryptocurrency: however you've heard Dogecoin described, it's recently shown that it's no laughing matter!

Just two years after the launch of Bitcoin, Markus and Palmer introduced Dogecoin as a \\u2018fun' and \\u2018friendly' alternative \\u2014 taking the famous meme dog \\u2018Doge' as their inspiration.  Although there is definitely a stark satirical element to DOGE, it's still a fully functioning cryptocurrency with its own online community. It was built on the Luckycoin protocol, which is itself built on the Litecoin platform. Like Bitcoin and other assets, Dogecoin users must mine the crypto before they can add it to their wallets. Unlike Bitcoin, however, there's an infinite supply of DOGE. (The number of Bitcoin tokens has been capped at 21 million).  In the eight years since its launch, Dogecoin has remained relatively separate from the wider cryptocurrency industry. This is partly because many \\u2018serious' crypto investors didn't believe the asset was worth their while. Until its recent growth, people who hold DOGE have mainly used it to tip online content creators, meaning its real-world use cases have been limited. However, it has also been used to raise funds for charitable causes. Most notably, the Dogecoin community raised more than $36,000 worth of DOGE to help the Jamaican bobsled team attend the Sochi Winter Olympics.

The supply at any given time is a factor of those who are mining DOGE coin mostly with state of the art computers, fast internet connection, and cheap or Free electricity, and those who already own DOGE and decide to sell it.  The demand is determined by those who want to buy DOGE and that is people who have been convinced by tweets from famous people like Elon Musk and Mark Cuban who sometimes do a one word tweet, DOGE and it creates a lot of demand. Other times in an interview Musk might make a comment about how he likes DOGE.  Now think just a bit about those who are buying, (the demand side of the equation) and those who are selling, (the supply side).  The supply has two types of people. Those who own DOGE already because they mined it in the past or bought mostly at a lower price than the current price, and those who are mining DOGE currently. Musk and Cuban, both very rich, have access to big state of the art computers and probably buy electricity cheaper than the average person. The supply of DOGE they have is probably from mining the coin at this advantage over other miners.  Now this is pure speculation on my part, I only suspect that Musk and Cuban mine DOGE. They may not. Or they may do it indirectly through a Hedge fund or other investment vehicle. But of course if they are mining it, Musk and Cuban like DOGE.  The mining reward for each block of transactions is 10,000 DOGE. They are at an advantage if they mine it, for winning the reward since they have the best equipment at their disposal. BTC mining reward is now 6.25 BTC, and even at the start was only 50 BTC.  There is no device in the programing of DOGE coin that halves the mining rate. This is what is unique about BTC and LTC, and DGB, and nearly every legitimate Crypto currency as it is hard wired into their code. It causes there to be dwindling supply over time, and this supply shock tends to drive the price up over time.  But with DOGE, because there is no halving of the mining reward DOGE has no supply shock over time. So the long term prospects for the price is due wholly on the demand that famous people like Musk and Cuban can create by making positive comments about DOGE.  Where BTC and legitimate cryptos rise due to both Dwindling supply, an ultimate hard cap on total supply as well as increasing demand, utilizing both sides of the supply and demand equation, DOGE has no Dwindling supply, No Ultimate hard cap, so there is no limit to the supply side of the equation. And it is unlikely that Musk will be able to continue to increase demand by his comments.  DOGE will eventually have a sustainability crisis.  Eventually all the people who follow Musk and are mentally shallow enough to be convinced to buy DOGE will have already bought it. At that point there will be no one else to buy at a higher price, thus the price will start crashing.  Crashes in price happen with legitimate cryptos like BTC as well but because the fundamentals are much better, (Hard caps, real world use cases, and mining reward halving) for the good cryptos, the prices are higher and more sustainable and as the long term charts show, the good crypto's follow a 4 year cycle because the mining reward supply shock is on a 4 year cycle.  Bottom line is this. Don't be a sucker. Don't buy crypto's that have no use case, were created as a joke, can be created to infinity, have poor fundamentals, and no dwindling supply built in. This is exactly what DOGE is. It's a fools coin.  Yes it might rise in price a while longer. Nearly all crypto's rise when BTC is in a bull market like it is right now.

That would make it more valuable than the most valuable company in the world, Saudi Aramco (at $2.5 trillion) and Apple (at $2.4 trillion).  Just no. Not going to happen. Certainly not in the next 12 months and not likely in the next 5 years.  #2 The Motivation For This Question  The motivation for this question is simple: if $DOGE were to go to $20, then it would do a little better than 33x.  So, I assume the questioner wants to know whether $DOGE can do at least 30x. The answer is no.  You are too late to this pump. Get over it and choose another one.  There are so many other cryptos out there that could do this\\u2014but you have to go outside the top 10 coins. You'll have to look at those in the 110 - 75 range (ranked by market cap).  My two favorite at or outside the top 100, because they are related to broader ecosystems are:  1. Voyager Token ($VGX) [ https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/voyager-token/ ], which is used for the Voyager Exchange. This exchange is available in the US and actually doesn't rip people off for their trades like Coinbase. It also lets you get interest 10% on your tokens right there (v. Coinbase's top yield of 2%). 2. Flow ($FLOW) [ https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/flow/ ], which is a layer 1 scalable blockchain by the developers of CryptoKitties and TopShot. Will it really beat $ETH? That's unlikely, but it could find a niche space and pump 10x. Ok, so there you go. The above statements are not recommendations for any of these, since the whole space is crazy right now. I just wanted to give you a sense of what it takes to pump even 10x.  The top 100 coins all have a market cap above $1 billion right now! So, those large gains are harder to find.
