Moreover, the creators of EOS have also decided not to define this acronym and use it as it is formally. BlockOne has developed it; whereas, its core developer is BM (Daniel Larimer).  EOS has the ability to support all core and fundamental functionalities required by different businesses to enable themselves along with other people to make blockchain-based DApps in a similar fashion so that of the web-based applications.  These applications are hosted with functionalities like safe and sound access and authentication provisioning, permission, usage management, data hosting, and smooth communication between the end-users, DApp, and the Internet.  The EOS blockchain aims to build such a platform that can perform millions of transactions per second. These transactions are to be performed without any additional cost.  In EOS, blocks are produced by Block Producers, just like miners produce them in Ethereum. Once the blocks are generated, they are being paid by EOS blockchain instead of the users paying for them.  EOS blockchain system has a built-in inflation system that helps in the maintenance and proportion of an ecosystem. In EOS, two blocks are produced simultaneously every second.

Full blog post is here [ https://livecryptoinvest.com/eos-coin-super-fast-blockchain-for-decentralized-apps/ ]   What is EOS?  EOS is a cryptocurrency that is built on a blockchain named EOSIO. EOS coin went public in 2018. Block.one is the company behind this cryptocurrency.  Brendon Blumer and his team has developed this decentralized operating protocol.  For ensuring widespread distribution, 1 billion tokens were sold during the ICO of EOS coin.  This is also one of the few cryptocurrencies that managed to raise more than a billion dollar as investment.  Within a very short period, EOS coin has become one of the top ten cryptocurrencies in the market based on capital.  What will be the application of EOS coin and EOSIO?  EOS coin has started its journey based on Ethereum blockchain. Now it has become the potential thread to the market (decentralized application) Ethereum is focused on \\u2013 What an irony!  Similar to Ethereum, different blockchains developed on EOSIO will have the capability to communicate with other blockchains working based on the same platform.  In simple terms, dApps will be the main focus for EOS coin's blockchain.  dApps are the decentralized applications that can be developed on top of EOS blockchain and can operate based on smart contracts.  EOS is aiming to make decentralized applications a common entity in modern internet.  dApps will save resource, cost and increase efficiency without compromising security.  But one of the milestones for EOS blockchain developers to achieve that goal is to get fast transactions.  How dApps will use EOS coin on EOSIO blockchain?  The operation principle of dApps in EOSIO is similar to Ethereum.  Basically, EOS blockchain will stay at the core of the structure. dApps will be built on top of EOSIO.  dApps will stay in between users and blockchain in simplest structure. dApps will have the capability of transacting data to and from EOS blockchain based on smart contracts.  In this process, to operate blockchain, store data and maintaining smart contracts all monetary transactions will be done based on EOS coin.  So, What Is The Challenge EOS Coin Needs To Overcome?  Speed.  Yes, making the transactions super fast in the main challenge for EOSIO blockchain.  EOS is moving fast towards its goal of achieving incredible transaction speed of 1 million units per second.  If the developers can reach that goal, it will be dominating that industry sooner than you can think of. Just for your note, it will be faster than Visa transactions at this peak speed they are aiming.  By 2018, EOS achieved thousand transaction per second which is far from the actual target. But it is much better than the best alternative Ethereum.  Who wins at the end is still needed to be watched.

How to do with quilt cover, how about next year's EOS market  A series of questions will be clearified completely.  It took a week for me to collect data and analyze.  It is divided into three parts  I don't ask for any reward. I hope you can give me some upvotes  The content will be divided into the following three parts  1\\u3001 What is EOS  (1) what kind of currency, what kind of problems it solves, and what is the team background  (2) why did the \\\"star currency\\\" fall? What reason can investors get  2\\u3001 As an ordinary investor, how to view EOS  (1) buy or not? Why?  (2) EOS market analysis (about 3-8 months)  \\u2460 EOS is still in shock, and the trend has not come out yet. It is inevitable that EOS will explode after it comes out  \\u2461 Bitcoin and EOS and other mainstream currencies have totally different rhythms. Other mainstream currencies will definitely rise  \\u2462 EOS is up in the quarter! The short-term does not affect the trend of the large level, and the small level is subordinate to the large level  \\u2463 When is the buying time  3\\u3001 Have we made any profit  Let's start now.  1\\u3001 What is EOS  (1) what problems are solved  EOS is created by BM, who is a very powerful blockchain boss. He has done three blockchain projects, BTS, EOS and steem. Among the three currencies, EOS is the most famous.  (the above passage can be interpreted as: BM has money, power and team.)  EOS actually is aimed to solve the congestion problem of Ethereum.  EOS is known as the \\\"public chain of the next generation of smart contracts\\\". We should all know that Ethereum is the starting point of smart contracts, but BM has found a problem that the throughput of Ethereum is too small.  Ethereum is very congested. It can only process a few orders per second, so it is inefficient, and has low performance.  EOS improves transaction throughput by DPS technology, so EOS has been regarded as \\\"blockchain 3.0\\\" since its birth, and its ICO has lasted for a year. (generally, an ICO lasts for a few months, and EOS has been in operation for a year). ICO can be understood as giving the BM team initial funds to do something...  Anyway, the idea is very good, but there is a loophole in EOS - EOS is actually an inflation system.  Every year, some more EOS coins are created, which will naturally affect the price of EOS  But this is not a matter of life and death. What really makes EOS depressed is that:  Retail investors give it too much hope  For digital currencies, making money must be made secretly. Because only 10% or less of the people can make profit, the opportunity can not be disclosed to the world.  For example, EOS, we all know that the technology of EOS is strong, the concept is strong, and the BM is strong. So we sold our houses to buy EOS. Who will pump? Pumping costs too much.  Another example is BCH last year. At the end of last year, all analysts said BCH will be pumped more than $1000. What about the results? If everyone thinks it's an opportunity, it can't be an opportunity. In the end, BCH only reached over 400 and made a hasty settlement.  (2) why did \\\"star currency\\\" fall and what can investors conclude  Most people think it is opportunity. If you buy it, you will lose money.  The underlying logic is that the more you buy, the more difficult it will be to pump. Therefore, the makers have to whipsaw.  0  As long as retail investors buy at a high level and sell at a low level, the whipsawing is success. Otherwise, the \\\"selling pressure\\\" will be particularly heavy.  At that time, the EOS currency, known as star currency, blockchain 3.0, and K line were all so ugly. It's not that the EOS currency has no value at all, but that the makers have made a lot of profits. Why do they have to pump to the top to rescue retail investors?  At that time, there was a funny news story. When a man sold his house and bought EOS for $15, the famous saying \\\"the team is working\\\" came out.  2. As an ordinary investor, how do you view EOS  Let's take a look at the trend of EOS. The market is getting weaker and weaker. There are too many people trapped. The high point of each time is getting lower and lower. If we don't look at bitcoin, we think it's a bear market. The fundamental reason is that retail investors have too much expectation for EOS, so they buy them crazily.  With that in mind, we can avoid a lot of scams. Even the coins that all people are optimistic about, you should carefully consider them and don't buy them blindly.  \\u2474Buy or not? why? This needs to be divided into circumstances. It is not recommended to buy in the short-term (within one month). In the mid-term, we can buy on dips and buy regularly.  The reason why it is not recommended to buy in the short-term is that eos has trapped too many retail investors, and the market makers can only use time to exchange space to wash the market.  In the short-term, you can buy some favorable coins, such as the folkedcurrency of BCH. You can also choose some coins with better trends in the mid-line. If the technology is good, you can also buy some new coins, such as: FIL.UNI, etc.  Why is it not recommended to buy short-term? ! Take a look at the short-term market of eos  In the previous wave of upsurge, a head and shoulders pattern came out... So the part of the head and shoulders is completely short-term pressure, and the pressure is at 2.97$. (BM uses his mouth to pump when the market drops, eos has gone two independent quotations, and many retail investors were trapped)  From the perspective of trading volume, it can also be seen that all above 3$ are pressure levels, because the head and shoulders pattern has emerged. The trading volume is large, and the support and pressure are large. In short,there is no power to punch, and the needle is only to liquidate the contract. So in the short term, there is no profit at all.  \\u2475the mid-term trend of eos (about 3-8 months)  If you have already bought eos or are stuck with eos, you should pay attention to the following text, how is the market of EOS in the future 3-8 months, how is the market from February 21 to May 21.  Let me talk about the result first: the mid-line trend is optimistic. Don't get excited, you have to hold it first.  As I wrote in the previous article [ https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-start-doing-BTC-investments (https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-start-doing-BTC-investments) ], all bids are pulled because the time comes, not because of good news. What is timing? For example, the completion of the accumulation and the strong buying power are all called opportunities.  How can I start doing BTC investments? [ https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-start-doing-BTC-investments ]  What about eos? Is the time yet?  Obviously, the weekly level has been suppressed by the 30-week moving average and by the 19-year trend line. The trend has not yet come out. There is another point. From the daily perspective, EOS is also hovering in a rectangular shock, up and down.  If the price fluctuates within this rectangular range, the time has not come. If it falls below the lower edge, it is a good opportunity to increase the position.  \\u2461The rhythms of mainstream currencies such as Bitcoin and eos are completely inconsistent, and they will definitely follow Bitcoin broke through $18,000 today.  But eos is still in the historical low range, so the rhythm is completely inconsistent, but this inconsistency of rhythm will be at a certain point, the mainstream currency will make up, and we are waiting for that point.  The recent yields of mainstream currencies are not as good as Bitcoin, (except for Ethereum). So speaking of this, EOS can still be invested at a low level because it is an ambush.  I will also talk about how to ambush below and how to buy investment regularly.  \\u2462 EOS is bullish in the quarter! The short-term does not affect the trend of the major level, the small level obeys the large level I also bought EOs, and I am also waiting for the explosion in the next quarter. I believe that few people notice the quarterly K line. Most people play short-term for 15 minutes. The higher the level, the more clearly the relationship between volume and price can be seen.  Come and see\\uff1a  Obviously there is a deviation between volume and price. Such a large-scale deviation of volume and price will definitely be covered. Then the opportunity for eos to cover is a quarterly rebound.  So even if the daily line is falling, the weekly line is ugly, but the quarter is bullish, so the result is still up, because the small level obeys the large level.  For example, seele, an altcoin, has the same reason for the quarterly outbreak as mentioned above. When the market makers finished making chips, it is when it rises.  NEO is the same.  This long process is very grueling to individual investors, and we can only wait.  So eos will not be an exception. It's just a quarter, and the waiting time is relatively long. A rebound will definitely come.  3. Have we ever made a profit for eos?  Yes.

Like most blockchains, EOS has its own crypto-currency, which is simply called EOS. It has a couple of different purposes.  You will have to pay transaction fees when using the Ethereum blockchain. This is called GAS and it becomes increasingly expensive as more and more people use the network. The EOS model is different though: EOS coin holders have control of the network instead of renting the computing resources. For instance, if you owned a 1 percent stake in EOS coins, you'd own 1 percent of the network, which means you'd own 1 percent of the computing power needed to process the transaction.  This is what frees up transactions! The EOS coin works in the same manner as any other cryptocurrency-between wallets you can send, keep, or receive funds. This makes it an ideal payment system because, in just a few seconds, you can pass money to everyone in the world for free.  Besides, all the dApps that are built on the EOS blockchain platform can be upgraded. This means that users can be allowed to deploy code fix, add / update functionality, and adjust application logic. In addition, developers can update their applications without being permanently attached to a bug.  Irreversible EOS smart contracts can also be deployed. But such decisions are based on developers' discretion and not on protocol restrictions.  EOS tokens can be deposited in various wallets like Ethereum Wallet, MyEtherWallet, and MetaMask, and tradable on exchanges such as Bitfinex and YoBit, BuyUcoin.  The above reasons are enough to invest in EOS tokens. Investment in EOS tokens would prove advantageous if done strategically.  EOS scope seems to be immense, as it seeks to solve the issues associated with traditional blockchain-based networks. It is, however, only a conceptual effort that may or may not produce anticipated fruits.

Not only is the 1D X around $6,000 (body-only), but you're going to need expensive CFast cards for 4K video, and the 4K video on the thing is in gigantic Motion JPEG files, and not all that amazing anyway. If I wanted a 4K camera for video, I'd recommend either get a Panasonic GH4 or perhaps a Sony A7s mark II.  The Nikon D80 (2006) and the D3 (2007) are ancient models and don't shoot video. The D3s does shoot video, but only 720p, not full HD.  The EOS 7D (2009) is also fairly old. It can shoot 720p or 1080p video, but only 12 minutes at a time. The others here can shoot 29\\u203259\\u2033 without stopping \\u2014 that's a limit set to avoid paying a European camcorder tax. While it doesn't apply at all in the USA, most camera manufacturers (other than Panasonic, far as I know) impose this limit even on North American and Japanese models.  The Nikon D5300 isn't a bad choice for video. It's a few models old, it came out in 2003, the current model is the D5600, so it's may be available for a value price. But this line is a consumer line, APS-C sensor, and not terribly expensive. It can shoot video at 1080p up to 60fps\\u2026 not something you'd need for vlogging, but you want 60p for sports or other action video. Another advantage for vlogging, the D5300 has built-in WiFi, so it can be controlled wirelessly via an app. Most Canon and Nikon can be tethered via USB for remote control, and some have add-on controls, but it's handy to have it built-in.  I have the EOS 6D, and it produces amazing video, particularly in low light, where it blows away my far more expensive dedicated camcorders. The 6D right now is a good bargain, but mostly because everyone expects Canon to announce the 6D mark II Real Soon Now. The 6D also has built-in WiFi.  The EOS 5D mark III is the upgrade of Canon's breakthrough EOS 5D mark II. It's a great camera, one of the go-to standards for video-on-stills camera shooting. But while it's a solid choice if you can afford it, it's not the best choice. For one, it's been superceeded by the EOS 5D mark IV, if you're looking for a higher end model that shoots great video.  Of those on your list, the Canon EOS 80D would be my choice for anyone wanting a strong video option. Like the Nikon, it can shoot a variety of modes up to 1080p60. But the real advantage is in the sensor. This is Canon's second-generation mid-range DSLR with what they call a Dual Pixel sensor. This sensor splits each pixel into two separate photodiodes. Based on the way they're masked, each sensor pair works like a phase-detect autofocus sensor. So unlike every other DSLR on your list, the 80D can give you full performance autofocus in video, and things you usually just find on camcorders and mirrorless cameras, like follow-focus in video, etc. Dual Pixel is also used on Canon's 5D mark IV and all the new Cinema EOS video cameras. And the 80D also has built-in WiFi.  Far as the larger idea of a full camera system goes, you can't really go wrong with either Canon or Nikon. They have the two most complete lines of cameras and two most complete collection of lenses. However, neither offers a mirrorless option. So that means you're only shooting video from the back screen, not the viewfinder. And that only the 80D on your list has fully function video autofocus\\u2026 the others will AF in video, but it's on demand, not continuous, and it's often not very good. The phase detect sensors that DSLRs use are not available with the mirror up, which is what you have in video mode.  For one-person vlogging, keep in mind you are going to want to see yourself, which means either an add-on monitor while shooting or an articulated screen. The 80D and the D5300 both have fully articulated screens which let you see what you're recording from the front of the camera. The others do not, and will absolutely require an external monitor for vlogging."}, {"upvote": 5, "content": "Of the cameras you listed, a 5d mark iii offers the best combination of value and performance.  A 1dx mark ii is crazy expensive and overkill even for most working professionals.  I do not like the ergonomics or build quality of the 6d line vs the 5d line. They feel like cheap plastic-y toys compared to the 5d line. Save your money.  The 7d line is a good workhorse of a camera if you want a crop sensor. A used 7d is around $300\\u2013400 and a used 7d mark ii is around $600 \\u2014 900. You really wouldn't go wrong with either one. Going with the older body lets you invest more of your budget in lenses which is the smart move for someone starting out. A good lens on a cheap body always beats a cheap lens on a good body.  The 5d mark III is a pro level full frame camera with just about every feature you can ask for. Unless your main focus is sports or wildlife, full frame is more useful than cropped. Used examples are around $1000 which is excellent value for a camera of that caliber.  The important thing to remember is that the camera body is the least important variable in the equation. You should be thinking of putting about 60-70% of your total budget into 1 or 2 really good lenses and only 30\\u201340% into the body.  What lenses you get depends on what you are shooting. I would probably suggest one general purpose zoom (the 24-70 f/4L IS is a great choice for either a 5d or a 7d) and maybe one specialized lens based on the type of photography you plan to do most. That second lens might be a macro lens, a wide angle for doing landscapes, a telephoto for sports and wildlife, a fast prime for portraits, etc. Don't buy gear on what you might need\\u2026 use what you have until you feel like you are being held back by the limitations of that lens, and then buy something that fills that specific need."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "After reading your list, I believe that you should buy no camera until you learn a little more about DSLRs.

IN fact cameras are now so good that just about any Mirrorless, compact or DSLR currently on sale is more than enough for most people's needs, whether it has a 1\\u2033, APS-C or FF sensor.  However:  If I were not already fully equipped with cameras that do everything I need AND money was no object then I would get either the 5D iv or the 1Dx ii.  Both cameras are great generalists and are capable of being used for just about any kind of photography, but for most people on ordinary incomes, they are expensive purchases, and being fairly new (in mid 2017) their resale value will fall quite steeply and you will lose a lot if you decide that they are not for you and have to re-sell them.  If I expected to occasionally make extremely large prints, or if I had to carry the gear for hours every day I'd tend towards the 5D iv. If rapid operation, Focus tracking, toughness and dim light ability mattered most I'd tend towards the 1Dx ii.  If you are a beginner and just starting out I would not get any of the cameras on your list. I'd get myself an inexpensive second hand camera, perhaps with as few as 8Mp, and a lens of mid-range quality to suit whatever I intend to photograph. The camera can be of a previous generation of technology. Digital cameras were already very, very good by the middle of the first decade of the 21st Century. Just because current cameras are even better is no reason to be sniffy about older used equipment. Used within their limits older cameras can be excellent.  After using that for a few months you'll know what matters to you and what doesn't and you'll be able to make an intelligent decision about more capable equipment.

However, it then doubled in less than 24 hours, with EOS hitting $5.40.  This hike did not last, however, and the coin soon started falling, breaking one support level after another. EOS found its bottom at $0.59, which is where it remained until late October 2017. Once the crypto bull run that marked the year reached its peak, EOS joined the rally, and it skyrocketed to $16.39 on January 13, 2018.  However, while most coins peaked around this date or earlier, EOS' all-time high came later, in April 2018. In mid-April, the crypto market \\u2013 which had been crashing since January \\u2013 started seeing a new bullish wave. Prices started going up, and many assumed that the so-called 'crypto winter' was over.  These days, we know that the surge in April was only the eye of the storm, as the crash continued as May 2018 arrived. But, for those few weeks, the EOS price jumped once more, breaking its former record, and going up to $22.89. This was the coin's highest price, and it has never reached these highs again, at least so far.  Following this second surge, EOS kept dropping, briefly stopped by support here and there, but eventually, it dropped to its new bottom at $1.86 around December 7, 2018. In 2019, the coin saw gradual growth, although it progressed slowly, and everything it had achieved by mid-2019 was undone in the second half of the year, as it slowly returned to the level where it sat ever since \\u2013 between $2 and $2.8.  The EOS price has fluctuated in this range, except for on three occasions in 2020. The first one was between mid-January and mid-February, when it joined another bull run that took it to $5.35. The second was in August 2020, when it hit $3.7, and the last one is right now, led by Bitcoin (BTC), which is once again approaching its all-time highs at $20,000.  EOS, on the other hand, is as far away from its own record as it can be, hovering around $3.26.  What is happening to EOS these days?  Unfortunately, EOS has not been making headlines in 2020, as the crypto industry is mostly focused on the decentralised finance (DeFi) sector. When DeFi started slowing down, bull runs took over, and most of the attention went to Bitcoin.  However, that does not mean that EOS has been doing nothing. Its developers at Block.one recently announced the EOS Resource Model proposal, and the soon-to-arrive review of various talented organisations that responded to the company's invitation to evaluate their code.  Block.one also recently expressed its pleasure with how Spielworks built a rewards and loyalty platform for gamers using EOSIO.  The company also worked on adding new features to its Training and Certification segment of the blockchain.  And, of course, as a development platform, EOS has also been making moves to attract people to develop new DeFi projects on its network. The network already has quite a few successful projects, although the majority of the developers are still focusing on developing DeFi on Ethereum.  EOS price prediction 2021: what to expect from EOS going forward?  Lastly, we arrive at the most interesting part \\u2014 EOS coin price prediction for 2021 and beyond.  According to TradingBeasts, the EOS price in December 2020 will reach a maximum of $3.4, after which the forecasting service expects it to drop back down to $2.7, on average.  In January 2021, its EOS crypto price prediction shows the coin remaining near this level, at around $2.7, later expecting it to experience a slow but steady rise throughout the year, with the coin having the potential to hit a high of $3.9 next December. The average price of EOS is predicted to reach $4.07 in December 2022, and then $5.03 in December 2023.  Wallet Investor also expects the currency's price to rise in early 2021, although their EOS coin forecast says that the asset will see a price crash in the second half of the year. The event will potentially lead EOS down to $1.2 one year from now.  As for CryptoGround, they have a very bullish EOS prediction. In fact, their EOS forecast claims that the coin will simply keep climbing, with its value reaching $4.17 in six months, $4.7 in one year, and $21.4 by December 2025."}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "Cryptocurrencies have taken the world by storm. The rise of the digital currencies in the past few years has been amazing. One such is EOS.  Home [ http://EOS.IO ] is an open-source blockchain platform, built to support and operate safe, compliant, and predictable digital infrastructures. Out of over 8,000 cryptocurrencies in the world, EOS was launched in June 2018 by Dan Larimer as an open-source decentralised operating system on blockchain.  After its launch, EOS gradually picked up pace and attracted investors' and programmers' attention. Its open source software was developed by Cayman Island's private firm Block.one.  EOS, which stands for Electro-Optical System, was at one time considered an \\u2018Ethereum Killer'. Its goal is to make it simple for programmers to embrace blockchain technology. It aims to achieve that by ensuring its network is easier to use than rivals.  The other factor that distinguishes EOS from its competitors is scalability. While most of its rivals can less than handle a dozen transactions per second, EOS promises to be way ahead of them. EOS tokens can be traded on different exchanges and also can be stored in various wallets such as Ethereum, MyEtherWallet, and MetaMask.  Here are some good new for EOS investors. Several analysts offer positive EOS predictions. Coin Price Forecast is estimating $4.21 for the end of 2022 and $7.36 for the end of 2025. Wallet Investor considers EOS a 'very good' long-term investment.  According to EOS, it has the capacity to handle the requirements of at least hundreds of dApps. dApps are the computer applications that run on a decentralised computing system. DApps have been popularised by distributed ledger technologies such as the Ethereum blockchain through the use of smart contracts.  According to reports, EOS crypto tokens are also created and earned in a unique way compared to Bitcoin mining. Users create the required amount of blocks and are rewarded with fresh EOS coins for each block they create. The EOS blockchain is often regarded as a major and direct competitor to the Ethereum blockchain.  There are more than 93.6 crore EOS coins in circulation today with a total supply of 1.02 billion coins. Block.one began an initial coin offering for EOS in June 2017 and it lasted for a year.

It doesn't have a promising market cap, there are several reasons to think it will show its possibilities a little later than we expected.  You have probably heard about Ethereum killers. EOS has earned that title basically by being more flexible than Ethereum.   %3E This flexibility will make it indispensable in the Web 3.0 era as developers will have a wide range of options in deploying both public or private, and permissioned or permissionless blockchain infrastructures.  article [ https://dailycoin.com/why-eos-might-actually-survive-web-3-0/ ] Also, the fact that it is largely decentralized shows us how it fits Web 3.0. All of this will help EOS navigate the uncertainties that may happen after Web 3.0 goes public. In short - the future looks bright."}, {"upvote": 2, "content": "EOS is the native cryptocurrency underpinning the EOSIO - Blockchain Software Architecture blockchain protocol. EOSIO - Blockchain Software Architecture is a smart contract platform for decentralized applications and protocol designed as an enterprise solution for scaling computer resources, emulating computer processing hardware, storage, and more. EOS was created, like many top cryptocurrency projects, to solve the speed, flexibility, and scalability issues and high fees in both Bitcoin and Ethereum.  EOS is based on a white paper released in 2017, developed by the Dan Larimer and Brendan Blumer lead Block.One. The EOS initial coin offering launched in June 2017 and concluded in the following June in 2018. The ICO broke records for the largest amount of capital raised in an ICO, pulling in over $4.197 billion.  EOS is among the more controversial crypto tokens across the crypto market, but due to its disruptive technology could have among the largest long-term profit potential. The blockchain technology behind the EOSIO - Blockchain Software Architecture protocol has the potential to drastically change the future of computer resources and applications and improve upon several businesses and industries. Due to the powerful impact EOS could have, it's long-term value could increase exponentially.  Using fundamental analysis to forecast the long-term outlook of the crypto asset, and providing technical analysis from experts from around the industry, long term price predictions can help an investor decide if EOS is a good investment.  EOS Forecast and Long Term Outlook  EOS has a total supply of 1,024,389,871 native EOS tokens, with 927,689,866 currently in circulation, according to crypto market data aggregate CoinMarketCap. EOS is currently ranked 8th in the top ten crypto assets by market cap, making it among the top cryptocurrencies in the market with the most positive long term outlook and expected growth.  From the EOS ICO launch to current prices around $3.50 per coin, EOS has brought investors an ROI of 244%. EOS reached an all-time high value of $22.89 on April 29, 2018, while most other crypto assets had reached their all-time high in December 2017 or January 2018, showing that EOS has shown additional bullish momentum that could help EOS coin reach the price forecast of the experts listed in this guide.  EOS has been dubbed the Ethereum Killer due to the 100,000 transactions per second it hopes to achieve, in comparison with Ethereum's current 15-30 tps. Despite being an Ethereum Killer EOS started its life as an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token, but later launched its own mainnet.  One often overlooked fundamental factor is the fact that the EOS cryptocurrency token's lead developer and Block.One CTO is Dan Larimer. Larimer has been called the Bill Gates of blockchain and is the inventor of proof-of-stake and the concept of decentralized autonomous organizations or DAO. He was also integral to the founding of other crypto companies BitShares, Steemit, and Graphene. Larimer's support and involvement suggest that EOS has long-term potential in the market, and this will have an impact on long-term EOS price projections.  EOS Price Analysis and Price Potential  EOS trades across cryptocurrency exchanges such as PrimeXBT under the trading pairs EOS/USD, and EOS/BTC. Technical analysis can be performed on each of these trading pairs, and give unique results. Oftentimes Bitcoin moves correlated to altcoin crypto assets such as EOS, while other times they diverge and move in opposition to one another. This provides analysts with a variety of tools to perform price predictions, find price targets, and more.  The lowest price recorded for EOS was a price of $0.48 per coin, during the early phases of the initial coin offering that resulted in over $4 billion in funds raised. In 2018, EOS launched to much hype and enthusiasm, and EOS reached its all-time high value in April at $22 dollars, but soon after was dragged down by the bearish sell pressure and the negative sentiment the rest of the crypto market and Bitcoin was experiencing at the time.  During 2020, EOS has fared much better and is showing signs of a strong recovery. Thus far, bounced from a low of $2.43 per token, to as high as $5.47 per token. On the EOS/BTC trading pair, the low was set at 0.00033621 BTC and reached a high of 0.00053145 BTC. Both pairs present a great long opportunity after two years of bear market and drawdown.  Factoring the total EOS supply, current prices, and the previous all-time high of $22.89, EOS has strong price potential and the future price outlook can only improve from here. Even at current prices, which are near local lows, EOS has provided early investors with a 240% ROI. At the previous all-time high, EOS brought 4669% ROI for early investors who bought the ICO and then sold the top.  A return to the previous all-time high of $22.89 from the current price of $2.50 would represent an over 550% increase and ROI. Gains such as these are unheard of in traditional markets, and that number only represents the ROI if EOS returns to its all-time high. Blockchain technology like EOS is new, emerging, and still has many years to go before it shows its true value and revolutionizes industries. When that happens, EOS true long-term price potential will be revealed, and many speculate that EOS future price will have a price target well above the previous all-time high.  EOS Technical Analysis and Long Term Price Prediction  In addition to fundamental analysis \\u2013 such as reviewing token supply, the team behind the project, and more \\u2013 and general price analysis, technical analysis can help predict EOS price trends, and help to find short-term price targets.  EOS Price Prediction 2020  EOS has been trading within a massive symmetrical triangle for most of its existence. It will likely remain trapped within the triangle for the rest of 2020, with a potential high of $3.50.  A drop, however, would take the price of the cryptocurrency to a low of around 50 cents per token. This scenario is unlikely, the asset has already fallen over 90% from all-time high prices and has built significant support below.  Due to the asset being relatively new, it has much price discovery ahead of it once highs are breached and new records set. A breach of an all-time high is still unlikely during 2020, but it will get close or potentially take out the high at the close of the year.  EOS Price Prediction 2021-2022  EOS doesn't have much price history to analyze for repeating patterns, however, the symmetrical triangle the asset has been trading within for its entire lifecycle was preceded by a powerful rise.  After a breakout of resistance and signaling the end of the bear market, EOS could experience another extremely powerful burst upward, returning to prices near $15 per EOS in 2021 or 2022.  Because EOS has little price history, another theory from Gerard Walker also uses Elliot Wave Theory to predict future price movements in EOS. This analyst thinks that EOS could reach as high as $40 per token in the near term.  EOS Price Prediction 2023-2025  Following a long-term growth corridor, EOS would continue to ping pong between the top and bottom of the channel.  Eventually, in the long-term future during 2023, 2024, 2025 and beyond, EOS could reach valuations as high as $500 per token.  Experts and Investors Weigh In On EOS Potential  To further add validity to the above EOS price analysis, EOS predictions, and below EOS forecast, the comments and involvement from industry experts and investment from venture capitalists can help provide a glimpse into the future of EOS and if the listed EOS predictions are realistic and achievable.  EOS and Block.One have among some of the most influential backers and investors in the crypto market. Even they understand how high EOS can go as an investment and what the long term EOS price potential can bring investors for returns.  Among the big-name investors behind EOS and Block.One, are former Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu and Peter Thiel. Wu said in a statement that the EOSIO protocol is a great example of blockchain innovation. Its performance and scalability can meet the needs of demanding consumer applications and will pave the way for mainstream blockchain adoption.  Crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital also has made a large investment in the project and the team. Founder Michael Novogratz said that thus far, EOS had significant outperformance relative to the rest of his company's portfolio and given the EOS forecast, he and his company will continue to work closely with Block.one as a key partner across a number of our business lines, including the Galaxy EOS VC Fund, which invests in companies building on the EOSIO - Blockchain Software Architecture protocol, and remain excited about the EOSIO - Blockchain Software Architecture protocol.  Lumeous CEO and founder Ali Ayyash claims that EOS is on its way to become the biggest blockchain ever and poised to become the dominant smart contract platform on the blockchain, beating Ethereum by a factor of ten.  Give how bullish these brilliant minds and powerful investors are on EOS price potential, the question is not will EOS go up, but how high can EOS go?  Is EOS a Good Investment?  The answer to the question is EOS a good investment is one only the investor themselves can answer after considering extensive fundamental analysis, price analysis, and technical analysis to ensure all due diligence was performed and the crypto asset was widely researched before investing. This guide serves as a condensed version of the vast amount of research required to select the right asset to invest in and feel comfortable in holdings and portfolio allocations.  Given its potential to disrupt industries and the fact it's already brought investors 240% ROI and it's only just been launched, EOS has enormous upside potential in the future and has a place in every investor's portfolio. How much to invest in EOS is up to the risk appetite of the investor and their comfort with the presented research.  If EOS reclaims its previous all-time high from current prices, EOS will provide investors with returns of over 550%. Using some of the price targets from the experts outlined above will give potential investors and traders interest in EOS a better idea of the long-term price potential.  At the $65-70 price target, EOS would bring a return of between 1700-1900%, crushing the gains of nearly every other asset class in history. But the $65-70 price target was the middle of the range for many top analysts.  On the higher end of the analysis, we had a $150 target price as a result of the greatest bull run in human history. Should the analyst be correct, and EOS goes on a massive bull rally reaching prices of $150 per EOS token, from the current price of $2.50 represents and over 3000% increase and ROI.  The highest and most profitable of the price targets would be at $349 per EOS token. From current prices to the loft long-term price target, EOS would appreciate just under 10,000%. A $1,000 investment would bring the investor a return of nearly $99,000.  If EOS is a good investment or not is subjective and entirely up to each individual investor, their taste, the amount of capital they have to invest, and their appetite for risk. This guide summarizes the most important data points across fundamental analysis, price analysis, and technical analysis to provide potential investors with short- and long-term price predictions, and help advise investors on how high the price of EOS can go, and allow individuals to make their own decision.

EOS can be understood as the Enterprise Operation System, a blockchain operating system designed for commercial distributed applications. EOS is a new blockchain architecture introduced to extend the performance of distributed applications. Note that it is not a currency like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but a token based on the EOS software project, called Blockchain 3.0\\u2014From Google.  So, EOS is not a cryptocurrency but a token based on its technology project. Then, thinking about the future of EOS must basing on EOS technology.  How is about the EOS software project?  Base on news from CoinNess, search the keywordEOS project, only can find a piece of news on June 2018. That news reported that the creator of EOS\\u2014Dan Larimer, releases Draft Proposal of New EOS Constitution.  It seems that there is little news about the development of the EOS software project. However, it does mean that the outlook of it is not reasonable. There are three features of EOS.  1. EOS is somewhat similar to Microsoft's Windows platform. By creating a developer-friendly blockchain underlying platform, it supports multiple applications running simultaneously, providing the underlying templates for developing dAPP.  2. EOS solves the problem of delay and data throughput through parallel chain and DPOS. EOS can process thousands of levels per second, while bitcoin is about 7 per second. Ethereum is 30-40 per second. ;  3. EOS has no fees, and the general audience is more extensive. The development of dApp on EOS requires the network and computing resources to be allocated in proportion to the EOS owned by the developer. When you have EOS, it is equivalent to having computer resources. With the development of DAPP, you can lease the EOS in your hand to others. From this point of view, EOS also has a wide range of values. To put it simply, if you own EOS, it is equivalent to having a suite rented to someone else to rent, or to have a piece of land rent for others to build a house [1].\\u2014-From Google  The construction of the EOS project is complete, and it is valuable for realistic applications in the future.

It essentially means nothing any more, as all cameras have decent focusing, and 'EOS' is no guarantee of a better focusing system (some people may quibble this, but the EOS system changes per model so is no longer even a standard).  The number of focusing sensors, their distribution and type, and whether the particular model is aimed at the beginner, intermediate or pro are all better indicators.  Ignore 'EOS', PDAF , 'TTL', 'SLT', back-lit' and all the other acronyms and key words to do with internal operation, and look at actual product reviews.  The only terms you should consider is the difference between 'DSLR' and 'Advanced compact' as the latter is now almost as good as the former for entry level, and far cheaper for the beginner (you don't need to pay out for quality fast glass) whilst allowing you to do everything you can with a DSLR. The terms \\u2018DSLR' and \\u2018mirrorless' may also matter (DSLRs tend to focus faster, although the most recent mirrorless cameras are changing this because computer processing now allows finer focus control via features such as eye-autofocus).  Here's one big thing to remember; For a still subject in good light, you cannot tell the difference between a photo taken with a $500 camera and a $3000 one. The reasons for buying the $3000 camera are to do with the subject not being still and the light not being good, and nothing else.  Just look at each camera as a self standing device compared against results vs price vs what you need. If you are set on a Pro model, buy second hand; a Canon 5D Mk 1 is as cheap as a modern entry level DSLR, and will fast-track you to pro, because you have a pro model to start with!

Canon took it as a challenge and gave its R&D a tight schedule to come up with a  highly-refined AF SLR model to be released on March 1st, 1987 which was also Canon's 50th Anniversary.  As planned, Canon hit the market with EOS 650, which went on to be a super hit , It bagged the Japan Camera Grand Prix award for the year 1986 and also the European Camera '87/'88 Award.

PS:I'm Canon1300d user"}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "To be honest, I haven't used either of the two but I started my journey with a Canon 600d. If you compare the specs, both 1200 & the 1300 are neither very different from it, nor are they too different from each other. The thing with Canon or for that matter with any big manufacturer these days is that they have to bring out new models every year. If they don't, their competitors benefit.  To answer your question I did a quick look up and a few differences that I could spot were the processor (Digic 4 vs 4+) and Wifi/NFC. For me, WiFi is yet not a viable feature in our country as we still lack the infrastructure required to transfer data at high speeds unless you are ready to spend a lot. I own a Canon 6d which has both Wifi and GPS, but I rarely use these features and rely on the trusty tethering cables to transfer data. Nor do I work sports or any other kinds of photography which require me to control my camera wirelessly.  Here are a few points to consider:  1. what kind of photography would you like to do? would you require real-time transfer of data or transferring data using a usb cable or copying the data via sd card would be enough for you. 2. Is speed a factor? Digic 4+ would obviously help you with buffering and all 3. Difference in the cost if the two is not too much, 5\\u20137k I think. If you would've already owned a 1200d, I would never recommend that you upgrade to the 1300. I'm assuming it's your first buy, so you should invest in the newer model, which is 1300d in your case. It should be faster and offer you a better resale in the future. There's a whole lot of difference in cameras in different segments and the companies would want to keep it that way. So, unless the comparison is between a 1300d and 760d and price is not an issue, you're better off with the newer model."}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "I wouldn't know what the differences without looking at the stats are comparing them side-by-side or talking with someone who sells both pieces of equipment."}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "cheap dslr body like 1XXXD are almost same you want to take picture like pro photographer that camera is not proper however you want to take picture just for record cellphone camera is better I thnk. if you want print or zoom you just see the pixel and choose the cheapest dslr"}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "Both cameras are almost same in their specifications.

This is a bit of a tough battle, but Black Star doesn't really stand a chance against any of these guys base forms. By base form, I mean Naruto in base with Kyubi's chakra, Ichigo as a Shinigami but not in Shikai, Natsu in base with Magic and Luffy in base with Gum Gum Powers. Black Star simply cannot compare to these guys. Back to the remaining four fighters, they would probably stay in base form for a while and get to know the enemy, Ichigo being in Shikai, then after a while, Naruto would resort to Nine Tails Chakra Mode, while Ichigo releases Bankai, Natsu uses Fire Dragon King Mode and Luffy starts using his Haki. This would go for a while, with Natsu gaining the upper hand, but then Naruto would release Nine Tails Chakra Sage Mode. Seeing that, Luffy enters Gear Second. While Naruto and Luffy have a duel of extreme speeds, Natsu and Ichigo fight each other in a fight of destructive power, as Ichigo accidentally unleashes his Hollow half. Finally, Ichigo gets control over it and transforms into his Merged Hollow Form, overwhelming Natsu with Quincy, Shinigami and Hollow, maybe even Fullbring Techniques, forcing Natsu into a Natural Dragon Force. Luffy then tries to attack Naruto with brute force, using Gear Third, Naruto barely stopping it in time, with a chakra shield. At this point, Naruto draws in chakra from the tailed beasts, transforming into Six Paths Sage Mode, forcing Luffy to transform into Gear Fourth Snakeman. Then, Natsu tries to attack Naruto, which prompts Luffy to go after Ichigo. Natsu is unable to faze Naruto, who just casually deflects his blows. Ichigo is unable to battle Luffy as he is too unpredictable. Luffy then accidentally attacks Natsu, which sparks a fight between them, Ichigo then fighting Naruto, feeling confused about why the fight was changing around so much, and also why they were fighting in the first place. It just sort of happened. Eventually, Luffy beats Natsu and Naruto defeats Ichigo. Then, it ends up as Naruto vs Luffy. Luffy may still have something up his sleeve, but Naruto uses his final form, Asura Kurama and his ultimate move, Six Paths Cho'odama Rasen-Shuriken, in that case. Otherwise, Naruto simply beats Luffy using Six Paths Sage.  In the end, Naruto is the winner. The story is only one of many ways it could have went.

Black star doesn't stand a chance against Natsu,Ichigo or Naruto either their just far too strong. This would really come down to Ichigo vs Naruto as their the strongest here.

I'll only promote the Bleach scans server that we're working on.  https://discord.gg/TUMMcvpHbR And the KSI server too  https://discord.gg/8vAFUtSFQK So onto the answer LMAO.   Before I make this answer, I want to address something.  Ichigo did indeed get his powers back or at the very least his Quincy powers.  Not only that but Ichigo in TYBW got his Zanpakuto basically restored by Tsukushima.  Now, if you pay attention to the first scan for a bit.  He basically made a completely different and alternate past where Ichigo's Zangetsu was never destroyed, think about it like this.  Let's say there's a past, a past that can't change, or anything like that because it already happened, and in front of the past is an infinite amount of possibilities, and as Yhwach states, the future to him appears like sand.  As he states, he can just pluck one grain of sand and change that, so because of that, ALL of those future timelines have been affected by Yhwach, and in basically every since one of them, he's destroy Zangetsu.  So what Tsukushima does, is create an alternate past, where Zangetsu was never destroyed, basically making new infinite timelines that Yhwach has never affected yet.  Basically all of this allows Orihime to revert the sword back to it's original form.   Now to ACTUALLY get onto the answer.  Due to all of this, we can say that EOS Ichigo most likely wins.  He was low end relative to a Yhwach as he was able to harm EOS Ichigo in the fight  Not only that but in the fight, he was able to severely harm Yhwach too  Not only that but Yhwach himself compliments Ichigo  And in fact, he even broke Ichigo's Zangetsu because it might have been overpowered.  Kenpachi is strong in his own right, he's stated to basically be the strongest Soul Reaper  (Won't beat Ichigo but).  Still though, Kenpachi has some good feats, but EOS Ichigo was able to fight Yhwach and be lower end relative to him.  I don't see any way for Kenpachi to win.   So imo, EOS Ichigo wins.

What subjects are you shooting? What would you like to shoot?  Is it family, friends, travel, sports, parties/events, wildlife, interiors?  Are you using wide views or shooting telephoto with the point-and-shoot? (The phone camera will be a mild wide angle.)  Capability For Sports And Wildlife  I've used an EOS 7D for years shooting wildlife and sports, with 500mm, 400mm, 70-200mm, and 24-70mm lenses. The 7D II adds some features, most notably a 65-point all-cross AF sensor suite. Cross AF sensors will focus more quickly in lower light on subject features at any angle. This system is in many ways better than the 19-point AF suite from the original 7D, and the EOS 70D.  Brian Lopes, 2010 Sea Otter Classic - EOS 7D, 70-200mm f/2.8L IS  Speed And Build Quality   The 7D II is very strongly built - just below the quality of Canon's 1D series cameras. The 7D II's weather sealing will make it fairly impervious to rain, mud and dust with a mounted L-series weather-sealed lens. It's very fast with two DIGIC 6 image processors.  But what do you want to shoot?  If you're interested in sports and wildlife, the 7D II will excel. It will also work very well for travel and events - I shoot all of these constantly with the 7D.   It's About The Lens System - Choose It First  It also mounts Canon's EF lens system - everything from full-frame fisheye lenses to an 800mm f/5.6 telephoto you wouldn't want to carry. Any EOS body lets you access one of the world's best lens systems. Any EOS body will perform well with those lenses.   Competitors  Sure, other makers have good lens systems, but the only competitor with an extensive system is Nikon.  Sony's A7 mirrorless cameras are lightweight alternatives. But using their electronic viewfinders outside in bright sun will show you blown highlights and muddy shadows where you actually get detail in pictures. At night, you may not see anything through the EVF.   Fajada Butte, Chaco Canyon - Fuji X-E2 mirrorless camera, Leitz 50mm f/1.4 - shot blind     Grow Into It  When manufacturers release new camera models, the older ones they replace don't stop working. I've used EOS 5D and 7D since 2009. The cameras still work very well for my needs.   So buying a capable camera you can grow into over the next couple years makes sense, especially with current camera quality levels and features.   Sure, you can start with any manufacturer's entry level dSLR and kit zoom lens, and have money left over for additional equipment.  Final Questions  But ask yourself: will you shoot fast-moving subjects? Will you shoot outdoors in crappy conditions? Are you likely to abuse your gear, however unintentionally?   If your answer to any of these is yes, the 7D II may be a good choice."}, {"upvote": 2, "content": "No.   The 7D Mk II is a pro-grade APS-C sensor camera designed for sports photography. It's main features are a fast autofocus system and high continuous shot frame rate. If you are not using those two feature a lot, you are just paying an extra $200 for a camera body with the same sensor as the Canon 70D.   Canon EOS 7D Mark II Review [ http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canon-eos-7d-mark-ii ]   In my opinion, you should not buy camera bodies to \\\"last a while\\\" because a $1400 camera today is not going to be better than a $700 camera in 5 years. So you can pay $700 for a decent camera now, and another $700 in 5 years and have a much better camera in 5 years for the same amount of money spent.  Personally, I would buy a mirrorless camera like the Sony a6000 because it is less than a third of the price of the Canon 7D Mk.2 - has arguable BETTER image quality  (more detail recorded, better color depth, high dynamic range) - it is also significantly smaller and lighter (making it much more likely for you to bring it everywhere with you, which is the most important aspect of any camera).

However, even if you sell your a6000 body with its lens in 5 years say for $200, you could still upgrade yourself to a better camera in 5 years for less money than buying a 7d mkII now.

It's a great camera, but it's serious overkill in performance for most people, and the added complexity in operation isn't going to benefit you. In the long run it won't hurt, of course.

Here's its predecessor...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCT-YMgjm9k The truth is, the camera doesn't matter a whole lot. Different cameras and systems have various strengths and weaknesses - Canon (Lens selection is crazy and generally the best value, but their products are more segmented and dynamic range is less than the competition). Nikon (Second best lens selection, better dynamic range, different operational theory to Canon in terms of interface, service dept. isn't as good), Sony (Again, better dynamic range. Mirrorless bodies are smaller. Lens selection is small. Focus performance is getting there but for tracking moving subjects, not there yet.  My recommendation is to go to a shop and try a few types of cameras out. Look at the available lenses and see what they cost, and if they have something that will suit your needs.  Any body you buy is going to be fully capable of making fantastic images. Most pictures will come out essentially the same with different camera bodies, unless you're pushing their limits, or comparing a low megapixel model to a high megapixel model for small details (In reality, they don't matter unless you're making big prints).  So, if you want to shoot sports and wildlife, the 7DII is ideal. If you're looking to do other things with the camera, you'll be paying more for a very performant camera, but it wouldn't have any major benefits to you over a 70D or D7200.

Choose a camera with a manual setting and experiment with the relationship between lens aperture (f-stop), shutter speed (time) and sensor sensitivity (ISO). Learn the difference between center spot metering and scene metering. Similarly understand the differences between spot focusing and scene focusing. Get a camera with a zoom lens and take photos of faces which fill the entire image both by zooming in on the face and by zooming out then walking forward until the face fills the image. Do you see the difference? Do you understand why there is a difference?  Next, learn the rules of good composition. Understand the rule of thirds, the importance of leading lines, the impact of light and shadow. Be critical of your images. Always ask yourself what would have made this photograph better and try out that idea. Watch photo movies on youtube and read as much as you can about photography.  Every camera has some limitations. Learn to work within those limitations. Start developing a photographic style. Work on seeing possibly great photographs when you walk around or drive anywhere. What do you find yourself photographing most - landscapes? people? buildings? flowers? insects? sports? sunsets? birds? wildlife?  You can do all the above with a relatively inexpensive small-sensor mirrorless camera with a zoom lens. It will be a fairly small camera which is not too much of a problem to carry with you. Take as many images as you can and then study each one. Rinse and repeat until you instinctively know what the image will look like before you even take the shot. Before you even lift the camera you just know that you have to move about twenty feet to your left and to kneel to get the right shot. You just know that the shadow across the front of the church will disappear in half and hour and give you a magnificent image. You just know that the contrast is too high and highlights in the scene will be blown out as white blobs, so you need to under-expose the image a bit. This may take a long time, but remember no pain - no gain.  When you reach this stage in your personal development you will know where you want to concentrate your photography. You will understand what features you need in a camera and where your current camera is limiting you. You will also understand the principles of different focal lengths for different images and how crop factor influences the focal length of a lens.  This is the time to make a list of all the things you MUST HAVE in a camera as well as those items which would be NICE TO HAVE if available. For instance lets assume you become most interested in sports photography. Your list of MUST HAVE items in a camera may include   * Fast shutter speed - 1/8000th.  * Fast continuous shutter - 10 or more frames per second.  * Fast accurate focusing and focus tracking  * 100mm to 500mm zoom lens  * In camera 5-axis sensor anti-shake system Now look at camera specs which meet this list and choose the ones that meet all the requirements. Then, from that shortlist choose which you like best because of its price, design, battery life, LED screen or whatever. You will then end up with the camera that suits your needs and makes you happy - and don't limit yourself to a Canon 1300D or a Nikon D3300 because your friend has one or the guy in the photo store recommends it for beginners. At that stage you are an experienced photographer and no longer a beginner!"}, {"upvote": 4, "content": "Hi Shubham, thanks for the answer request.

It is a decentralized platform based blockchain and enables the users, organizations, and different entities to develop, and execute commercial-scale distributed and decentralized apps. (DApps) using same platform.  It is different from both Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of its design paradigm and technical implementation.  The term EOS has no officially declared full form. Moreover, the creators of EOS have also decided not to define this acronym and use it as it is formally. BlockOne has developed it; whereas, its core developer is BM (Daniel Larimer).  EOS has the ability to support all core and fundamental functionalities required by different businesses to enable themselves along with other people to make blockchain-based DApps in a similar fashion so that of the web-based applications.  These applications are hosted with functionalities like safe and sound access and authentication provisioning, permission, usage management, data hosting, and smooth communication between the end-users, DApp, and the Internet.  The EOS blockchain aims to build such a platform that can perform millions of transactions per second. These transactions are to be performed without any additional cost.  In EOS, blocks are produced by Block Producers, just like miners produce them in Ethereum. Once the blocks are generated, they are being paid by EOS blockchain instead of the users paying for them.  EOS blockchain system has a built-in inflation system that helps in the maintenance and proportion of an ecosystem. In EOS, two blocks are produced simultaneously every second. Out of these two, only one will be allowed to generate a block and the other producer who does not generate a block within a specific period and will be removed temporarily from the network."}, {"upvote": 9, "content": "You could say it has 1 advantage with more scalability, but at a heavy price, because it chose to be permissioned and non-trustless instead of permissionless and trustless.

ECAF ordered to freeze the hacked accounts, blockchain isn't immutable. many both inside and outside the EOS community aren't clear what ECAF, the main body tasked with resolving disputes between token holders on the network, is and what control it has over transactions. 2.

This wouldn't be so bad in a trustless and permissionless platform, but wreaks havoc in a non trustless and permissioned platform. Also if it were several people in charge that have to write a constitution, it's even worse, because writing a constitution with many people is always victim of special interests, lobbying and the like. 2. A design that doesn't prevent cartel formation. Cartels always happen if it is possible. 3. If the security of a network relies on 1 person, it can't get mass adoption, because that person has to be perfect. Unfortunately, he isn't perfect, because he has made a very bad constitution.

Keep that term in mind -- \\\"video clips.\\\"    The 60D is great is your shooting intermittent shots, and they are somewhat planned -- you have to set your camera up for video, half press the shutter button to get a focus and exposure read, then hit the record button.  Once you start recording you do not constant auto-focus, like a camcorder.  So if your object is moving, you will have to follow focus the shot  manually, which is difficult to do, particularly if you are not using after-market follow-focus equipment.  Also, there is a limit to how long the shot could be (I think it's up to 12 min, depending the quality setting you set. Audio is somewhat on par with low-end consumer camcorders, but you can again plug-in aftermarket equipment.    All in all, the 60d good for video?   Depends how you shoot video and what you're shooting.  If you're covering your son's soccer match, and you want the 'entire' match on video - no.   If you don't want to buy external mics, tripods, monopods, stablilizers, follow-focus tools - no.  If you don't want to deal with a long learning curve shooting DSLR video. - no.

That nowadays photo cameras shoot video is more of a marketing thing to boost sales. Part of problem is the sensor type. That does not mean you cannot shoot a decent video with the 5D, 7D or 60D, but that does not make them good cameras to shoot video.

The photos posted here don't really tell us what is you are objecting too, is it even related to the camera, or your own technique?  I jumped from the 40D (which I still use) to the 6D and then 5D MKIII. I love my 6D and it stayed as a second body and for landscapes when travelling as it's much lighter than any of the 5Dx series and slightly better in low light than the 5D MKIII, Really can't go wrong with it. The 5D MKIII is much more of a great all rounder though, street photos, action, birds in flight, all reasonable, the 6D is better for more sedate subjects.  I picked up a 5DSR and it is an amazing camera for detail in static objects. A little tricky to use, as all your shutter speed and DOF assumptions need to change, you really need to check the image at 100% to ensure sharpness until you get used to this, however the biggest issue for me is not related to the camera at all, it's the resolution, it's huge! As a result almost nobody ever sees the photos in all their glory! When publishing them (unless you plan to really crop in) then a lot of the detail is lost in the conversion process to whatever resolution you intend to display them in. If they are for web use or to be displayed on a typical panel at 1080p then all those delicious details you really loved are lost in the down sample. You end up either cropping the hell out of them to highlight the details you cared about or putting them online and letting the viewer zoom in and see all the details, which nobody ever bothers to do. Think watching a 4K movie on a 1080p TV. If you print however it's can be a different story it makes a difference (to a point).  Also be aware that the 5DSR has (subjectively) poorer ISO than the 6D, MKIII and MKIV, ISO 3200 is about as high as you ever wish to go and most of the time I don't like to exceed the low thousands, which can be challenging, requiring faster lenses. Diffraction becomes an issue earlier also, I'm scared to go above f/11 most of the time for fear of 50MP of soft images. There is nothing more disappointing that getting home and that pin sharp looking image that gets softer and softer as you zoom in.  That said when you nail it, it really is a thing of beauty, the detail is extraordinary, but you really need decent lenses to get the most out of it and a decent monitor to view it on. The 5DSR and the 11\\u201324mm is a formidable (but heavy and expensive) combination and with the 100\\u2013400mm you do macro and with some cropping you can do macro at 10 feet away ;-) My favourite light weight landscape lens with this is the beautiful 16\\u201335mm F/4L.  The move to full frame is a bit of a marketing game, OK better ISO but APS-C is catching up fast and then there is the cost of new lenses, as you'll need to get EF lenses. Once you are at equivalent resolution (say 1080p on your monitor) you would be pushed to tell the difference between the 6D, 5DMKIII,5DS/R and IV, expect for ever improving dynamic range.  You don't mention how many lenses you have but if they are EF-S they won't work on any of your FF bodies. If you've not really heavily invested in Canon EF glass, then newer bodies from Nikon and various others have better\\u2026.almost everything for landscape (Pentax K1, Nikon D750 etc) Not enough to persuade me to jump ship but if was just starting out I'd probably go with something else but as the camera companies are forever playing leapfrog with each other, it matters little, whatever you buy somebody has better one out tomorrow, I prefer Canon's handling.  Since I regally shoot with all four of these bodies I'd choose the 5D MKIV right now for one very important reason, you really get a hell of a lot more latitude in the RAW files than any previous Canon camera, especially in the shadows. Gone are the bad old days of exposing for the highlights to find your shadows are a mess of noise and banding in when you lift them in post. Seems kind of lazy, but saves an awful lot of messing about bracketing or with filters in the field (which I hate, especially when travelling or when it rains) and I'd expect the 6D MK 2 to benefit in the same way, makes a massive difference to what you can do with almost every shot you take and allows you more more latitude when exposing to the right. Canon is still behind Nikon and Sony on this front but not by much. The one and only thing I don't like on the MKIV is it has a poor battery life compared to the 6D/MKIII, don't get me wrong it's still great but I'm used to a single battery covering me all day on the MKIII the MKIV chews through them much quicker even with all the Wifi/GPS turned off, still way better than the Sony A7RII or any of the other mirrorless bodies I own.  That said, it's hard to buy a bad camera at the 6D price point, anything you buy from any manufacturer will take amazing images in just about any conditions from dusk till dawn, as long as you know how to do so and here is the rub. Lenses and technique combined with decent post processing skills will help more than any new camera body. Limitations in ISO, dynamic range and all the other things that improve in new bodies are just walls you hit, the difference is you hit them later on pro/enthusiast gear, they can be easily overcome using fairly standard techniques such as bracketing, filters, longer exposures at lower ISO etc.Especially in landscape where you are usually tied to a tripod, so easy to do. Newer cameras eliminate a lot of this messing about so us lazy consumers want them, however very difficult replicate the sharpness of a decent lens or the beautiful bokeh on a F1.2 lens in post ;-)  Hope this helps and your enjoy your trip.

The image processors are a minor upgrade (arguable), and newer features are mostly just marketing or efficiency of automation. The features of cameras newer than the 60D tend to be relatively insignificant \\u2013 the 60D functions well enough for anyone with sufficient photographic skills, and any drawbacks can [mostly] be compensated for by hacking it with Magic Lantern or by using alternative techniques and tools. For examples, if a newer camera does auto-HDR, the 60D can be hacked or you can do manual HDR; or if a newer camera has a timer, you can use a $12 intervalometer.  Granted, number of autofocus points, sensor size, and similar features could provide significant advantage. Apples to apples, those are not quite in the same realm of comparison.  The 60D remains a good camera, and will continue to be good for several years.  As usual, glass and photographer skill make more difference than camera body."}, {"upvote": 123, "content": "It's the paper or plastic, Coke or Pepsi for photographers\\u2014Canon, or Nikon? While one photographer will swear by his Canon, another will insist her Nikon is the better option. So which camera is best? That's a matter of opinion\\u2014but that doesn't mean the individual camera brands don't have characteristics that may make them more suited to one type of photography or one type of photographer over the other.  When comparing Canon vs. Nikon side-by-side, there are a lot of similarities, like solid image quality and a wide range of accessories, but there's a lot of differences too\\u2014some subtle, others, not so much.  Canon Vs. Nikon: Sensors  Both Canon and Nikon offer cameras powered by similarly sized sensors, but there's a lot more that goes into image quality than just the size of the sensor. Just when one manufacturer seems to leap forward in sensor technology, the other catches up.  Most of Nikon's latest DSLRs use a new sensor design that allows them to eliminate the optical low pass filter without an abundance of moir\\u00e9, or distortion in fine lines and patterns. The filter is one more thing for the light to pass through before hitting the sensor, so eliminating it allows the camera to pick up more details and perform a bit better in low light. All of Nikon's 2015 APS-C sensor cameras don't use an optical low pass filter and a handful of their full frame professional models have eliminated it as well.  Canon's latest DSLRs, on the other hand, seem more focused on the megapixels. Most of Canon's DSLRs still use an optical low pass filter, though there are options like the Canon EOS 5DS R that do without. Their latest big announcements come in the form of full frame DSLRs with a whopping 50 megapixels. While judging a camera on megapixels alone is like judging a book by its cover, the EOS 5DS does capture a 8688 x 5792 resolution, where the Nikon D810 with 36 megapixels captures at most 7360 x 4912. The higher resolution allows for larger prints and more cropping without affecting the image quality.  While the two are focusing on different areas of sensor technology, Canon and Nikon DSLRs both have excellent image quality. That doesn't mean you'll get the exact same image when shot with two different cameras, though. Colors between the two options can be noticeably different, for example. Which one produces better color is a matter of personal preference\\u2014they are simply different, there's no right or wrong answer.  Canon Vs. Nikon: Speed  Canon and Nikon come in pretty even as far as the speed of their autofocus, but there's a subtle difference in their burst speed rates. Speed is hard to come by in DSLRs\\u2014where it's not uncommon to find a mirror-less camera with a 10 fps burst mode, DSLRs have more gear to move to take a picture and it's tougher to reach those high speeds.  Canon tends to have faster high-end DSLRs. The Canon EOS 7D Mark II ($1,799) hits an excellent 10 fps burst rate, making it one of the top DSLRs for sports shooters. Nikon's fastest APS-C camera, on the other hand, is capable of 6 fps, the D7200 ($1,199). Getting even further into the advanced options, Canon's full frame 1D X hits 14 fps, where the similar Nikon D4S gets 11 fps.  When it comes to the entry-level, more budget friendly models, however, Nikon offers more speed. It's usually just by a frame or two though, as when comparing the Nikon D7200's 6-7 fps to the Canon T6S's 5 fps.  Canon Vs. Nikon: Operation  Performance between the two brands is pretty similar, but there are some noticeable differences when it comes to operating each camera. The terminology on a Canon is different from that on a Nikon, for starters. The S on the Nikon's mode dial and the Tv on the Canon both indicate shutter priority mode, for example. Nikon also uses simpler terminology for autofocus modes\\u2014it's a bit simpler to remember what Continuous Autofocus is versus Al Servo Autofocus (they're both the same thing).  There's also often a significant difference in battery life, with Nikons generally able to take more shots on a single charge. For example, the Nikon D7200 has double the battery life of the similarly priced Canon T6S. That's not the case with every model, but, more often than not, Nikons have a better battery rating.  Canon Vs. Nikon: Video Quality  Canon, traditionally, has offered better video quality sooner. They were the first to develop a hybrid autofocus system allowing the camera to refocus while recording. Canon is known for their better autofocus tracking while recording, and they also have a selection of lenses designed specifically for video.  Answering which brand has the better video quality two years ago would have been much simpler. Where a few models ago Nikon didn't offer autofocus while recording video, their latest DSLRs offer continuous autofocus. Comparing models individually across the brands, Nikon even has some cameras with a 60 fps frame rate for smoother motion where the equivalent Canon has 30 fps. Canon traditionally offers the better video, but Nikon's latest developments put them much closer.  Canon Vs. Nikon: Options  When it comes to the more advanced DSLRs, there's pretty much a Canon to match every Nikon. That's not always the case though. Nikon hasn't yet come up with an answer to Canon's speedy 10 fps EOS 7D Mark II, and Nikon has a camera designed specifically for astrophotography, the D810A, where Canon's similar option has a smaller APS-C sensor.  When it comes to entry-level options, however, Canon's selection doesn't quite match up with Nikon's models. There are older Canon DSLRs available for around $500, but the current models (as listed on Canon's website) start at $899 for the body only for the EOS 60D. Nikon's D3300 offers full DSLR capability to beginners for a $650 list price\\u2014and that includes a kit lens. Canon offers a model priced fairly evenly with the enthusiast Nikon D7200, the T6S, but there are some pretty significant differences. The D7200 has no optical low pass filter, 51 autofocus points, 60 fps HD video, 6-7 fps burst shooting and an 1,100 shot battery life. The T6S, by comparison, has an optical low pass filter, 19 focus points, 30 fps HD video, 5 fps burst shots and half the battery life. Where the specs are close in the high-end models, Nikon often offers more in their entry and enthusiast options (though again, that's not always the case).  Canon Vs. Nikon: So which one is best?  Buying a DSLR is a bit different than buying a compact camera, because once you start accumulating lenses, it becomes much more expensive to change brands. Since the two brands operate a little differently (and with different terminology), switching would also mean relearning a few minor things.  So, then, which manufacturer is best? Which camera brand should you choose?  The answer? There isn't a winner\\u2014both Canon and Nikon offer excellent cameras with solid image quality. If one brand offered a better camera every time, the other would've gone out of business a long time ago.  But, that's not to say one brand isn't more suited to one person or the other. Beginners would likely be happy with a DSLR from either system\\u2014but Nikon offers a more affordable option that's still full of features and Nikon's terminology is a bit easier to understand when starting from scratch. Sports photographers can capture the action with a DSLR from either manufacturer\\u2014but Canon tends to offer more speed in their high end models. Quality videos can be shot on both\\u2014but Canon typically has a smoother autofocus and offers lenses specifically for cinema.  When choosing between camera brands, it's best to compare each camera individually\\u2014where Nikon may have a better entry-level DSLR, Canon may have a better DSLR for sports.  When making the choice between Canon vs. Nikon, here are a few things to consider:   * What is the most important thing in a camera to you? Speed? Resolution? Video quality?  * What does the manufacturer offer at your current experience level and for your current budget?  * What does the manufacturer offer that you might be looking to upgrade to in the future? While you probably won't be looking at the same options in five years, if they offer something in that range currently, they're likely to continue to making updates to that line.  * What lenses would you ideally like to add to your kit? Does that manufacturer offer those lenses? Canon or Nikon? Neither one is a bad choice, which means it's not an easy choice."}, {"upvote": 13, "content": "A problem you'll find is that very few people are Nikon / Canon ambidextrous if I can put it that way. You tend to commit to an ecosystem early on. But its a valid question, let me tell you how I chose.  I borrowed a couple of cameras and being totally new to digital (I'd been a Nikon user in 35mm film era) I just played with them to see which one was more comfortable to use.  Which did I feel I would get the hang of faster. And that turned out to be a Canon.  Just the way my brain is wired, the Canon's controls and menus seemed more logical.  Its as personal as that because what you don't want is a camera that gets in the way.    Ok so much for Nikon vs Canon.  Both your choices are fantastic cameras, per se.  As you get more and more fluent in using them (and in retouching the pictures afterwards) you will constantly amaze yourself with the images you are able to get.  Now for fashion and model photography.  I'll assume you're starting out or that you do it on a semi-casual basis because the first criteria to be top tier professional photographer (whatever the genre) is going to be experience and to get that level of experience you will have committed to an ecosystem along the way.  Either ecosystem can take you to the very top. You don't have to worry about putting your eggs in the wrong basket.  A lot of people talk about crop sensors vs full frame.  Yes, most professionals use full frame.  And in a chicken and egg way, most manufacturers put better features in their full frame cameras and lenses so if you need a specific capability you may only find it on the full frame models.  This is changing though.  The other advantage of a bigger sensor is simply that it captures more of the light.  Remember where I said you want the camera to get out of the way?  The full-frame sensor is less in the way.  You can get amazing photos with a crop sensor, I personally do use a crop sensor Canon 70D and I do everything from portraiture to fashion to product shots. My finished work cannot be distinguished from someone shooting with a full-frame camera next to me. I just have to remember I get less light and I have to make certain adjustments but after a while it becomes second nature.  Its a trade-off I'm ok with as it allows me to be more mobile, I have physically smaller and lighter equipment, my investment is less, all that stuff.  If my photos are unsharp or grainy it has nothing to do with the camera (you have to go a long way before you hit the edge of the envelope on what either of these cameras can do) its because I didn't set up the picture right."}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/Should-I-buy-the-Canon-EOS-100D-18-55-DC-III-Kit-Canon-EOS-1100D-18-55-IS-II-Kit-or-Nikon-D3100-18-55VR-Kit", "question": "Should I buy the Canon EOS 100D 18 55 DC III Kit Canon EOS 1100D 18 55 IS II Kit or Nikon D3100 18 55VR Kit", "answers": [{"upvote": 5, "content": "Canon 100D is better than Nikon D3100, which in turn is better than Canon 1100 D .

It was a Canon 1200D, a recent beginner camera released in 2014. I used it to learn almost everything about cameras, from aperture to histogram. I am satisfied by its performance.  I mainly used the Canon 1200D in my casual photography. Lately, I am into videos and filmmaking. I even planned to make videos for my channel using the camera.  However, I would later find out that the camera lacks many basic features that I need in order to create vlogs and videos, all by myself. It had no articulating screen, thats a real pain. I tried using DSLR remote pro, but it didn't work well. I could barely focus myself when I am filming. A lot of shots were wasted.  Other features are discussed in the video.  I bought it at a local store, and I got it cheap. Yes, real cheap. So, I decided to sell this camera and buy another one.  I am still on the process of finding the best DSLR for me. Lots of YouTubers recommended Canon 700D. Others recommended the 600D (Simon Cade). Casey Neistat wants the 70D, and Sean of ThinkMedia too. Andyax uses the GH4 from Panasonic. Of all these cameras, one thing is common. They are all not cheap.

Nikon India Private Limited [ http://www.nikon.co.in/en_IN/where_to_buy/where_to_buy.page?lang= ]  Canon however, doesn't have anything of this sort on their site, so I guess you can buy from e-commerce sites. Still check with Canon through mail or through one of their social media sites. Here's the official list. Statement on Canon India's Official Social Media Sites [ http://www.canon.co.in/personal/web/social_media?languageCode=EN ].  As for lenses, you can try Sigma and Tamron. Sigmas are slightly better built than Tamrons. These offer almost the same image quality at half the price. They are available for most models of Nikon and Canon. Then you have Samyangs, a Korean company building alternatives since 1972. They make some fantastic mid to high level lenses at a much lower price. For starting lenses, you can also try Yongnuo lenses. The price difference is almost a third.  However, if you plan to upgrade your camera later and think of building a collection of lenses for yourself that'll work in your later cameras, then go for your camera brand lens. Other brand lenses won't guarantee future compatibility.  A case in point is a 20 year old AF Nikon lens will work in most modern Nikon DSLRs.  Compare prices online before you go out to buy. That will give you an idea about the price you can expect and what to bargain for. Don't hesitate to ask for memory cards or other goodies to be included in the price. Most dealers offer that or a good deal on accessories.  If you are in Kolkata, you can check out:  1.  MM Photography   Moti Sil St, Dharmatala, Taltala, Kolkata, West Bengal 700013, India.  OR  2.

One rule of thumb that can be followed with most lenses, regardless of manufacturer, is: the heavier the lens, the more glass it has, the higher the quality. The EF, EF-S, and EF-M designations have as much to do with the type of camera as it does the lens.  Canon produces 3 levels of camera, as well, in the DSLR line. The designations can be read in the model number. 3 & 4 numbers (1200D) are consumer level, 2 numbers is semi-pro (70D), and one number is pro (5D, 6D, 1D). The difference in all these instruments are significant, but might not mean much to the beginner shooter. The cameras in the consumer and semi-pro lines will take all the lenses that Canon manufactures (EF and EF-S). However, the pro cameras will only take the pro lenses (EF). This has to do with sensor size, mostly.  BUT Canon is not the only lens that the 1200D will take.

Do not get this line of thinking stuck in your head because it's not entirely true. In fact, to be honest, this statement is used many times by people who simply can't afford good gear and are jealous at those who can. If you can't afford good gear right now, that's fine; work with what you can afford and save up money to grow into better gear over time. The best camera is always the one you have with you and by this I mean, if you own a $6,500 Canon 1DX and it's sitting at home, your best camera may be the free one that came built into the phone in your pocket!  While it is true, skill is the most important aspect of almost anything, including photography, your gear and even more specifically, your lenses, are just as important. A good lens on an inexpensive camera is always better than a cheap lens on an expensive camera. If you're just starting out and looking for a camera for a beginner, try to think about what sort of photography you'll be doing. General photography such as family photos, photos of your friends, pets, etc.; landscape photography; wildlife photography; street photography, etc. If you don't know yet, that's okay but if you have a goal of developing skills specific to one of these styles, it will help with camera selection.  When getting started, I'd get something inexpensive but not so cheap that your photo quality ends up discouraging you altogether (again, this is where the \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" nonsense kicks in.) I'll cover a couple types and why they're good starter cameras. And with any camera you choose, always try to keep the camera out of \\\"automatic mode\\\" if possible so you begin to master the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  Point-and-Shoot or Camera Phone  These cameras are very inexpensive and with the newer smartphones, the camera is built right in and often takes better photos than the DSLR's from just a few years ago! This is the most inexpensive route to take (and may not cost a penny if you use the camera on your phone) and it helps you learn about composition, lighting, etc. If you're already past this point and want a camera you can grow into, the following are good options:  Traditional SLR's  I know, this is probably not what most people think of when deciding on a beginner's camera but I want to mention it because if you have one of these lying around in your house (parent's or grandparent's old camera, etc.), they're great for learning the basics of a camera with all of the digital stuff removed. SLR (single lens reflex) cameras aren't used much anymore because of the cost of operation, decreased photo quality, and lack of film processing labs, however, I think any aspiring photographer should own or at least use one because they are the \\\"original camera\\\", they are inexpensive, and they help give you a greater appreciation for the luxury of digital photography (not limited to 24-36 photos per roll, immediate results where you can see your photo seconds after taking it, easy and fast multiple frame shooting, and no cost by ruining a roll of film or wasting it on bad photos.) If you buy a traditional SLR 35mm camera, I'd go for something like the Nikon 35mm F2AS with a 50mm \\\"prime lens\\\", or similar. Here's a photo of one of mine:  Digital SLR's  Digital SLR's, or DSLR's, have been the most popular choice for many years now, they're easy to find used, and they're a good starting point in learning photography. These cameras are basically digital versions of the original SLR camera but offer much more flexibility and many more options. Whagt we're seeing right now, however, is a switch from DSLR's to \\\"mirrorless cameras\\\", including the very popular \\\"Micro Four Thirds\\\" cameras which use a smaller sensor, yet often outperform the DSLR's. I'll touch on those, below. Anyway, an inexpensive or used DSLR is a good choice for starting out and I'd recommend an entry level Canon DSLR such as one of the \\\"Rebel\\\" series cameras. I currently use a Canon 1DX which is NOT a beginner's camera, and my old Canon 5D Mark II (this is a great beginner's camera, easy to find, and inexpensive.) Here's a photo of the Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm prime lens attached:  Mirrorless Cameras  These cameras really are \\\"the future of photography\\\" although many professional photographers would scoff at you for even suggesting such a thing because just as it was when SLR's were phasing out, DSLR using pro's often get stuck in their ways and refuse to move with the times. Even today there are professional photographers who refuse to switch from SLR to DSLR! Mirrorless cameras are superior to DSLR's in almost every way: They have higher resolution (megapixels) for a fraction of the cost of DSLR's; there's no mirror flapping around making noise and causing camera vibration; they're smaller and easier to carry, many can shoot 4K and even Cinema 4K video (while Canon and Nikon refuse to adapt and offer this feature for a reasonable price in their DSLR's); and overall, they're less expensive. If you can afford one (they're often cheaper than many new DSLR's), go for it! I currently shoot with a Panasonic Lumix GH4 because I shoot photography AND I need to shoot 4K video and this camera does both. An even less expensive alternative is the Lumix GH3 which sells for around $500, a quarter of the price of the GH4. Here's a photo of the Lumix GH4, a \\\"mirrorless camera\\\":  Regardless of what you choose, unless it's a cheap $30 point-and-shoot or your phone's camera, try to make a decision on which camera format you want to grow into, otherwise you'll be wasting money on a camera and the expensive lenses that you'll end up not using when you switch to a different format.  Taking an introductory photography class or workshop is also a good idea when getting started as you'll more quickly learn the basics including aperture, exposure, shutter speed, composition, and editing.

After so much reading, talking to other photographers and feeling both the cameras on the hand, I decided to get the 60D. Here's why I did:  1.Build Quality: Most of the differences between these two cameras are in this section. Although the 600D is lighter and a smaller, the weight in the 60D is more evenly distributed. So when you fix your lens onto the body, the 60D is more balanced, offers better handling and feels even more grippier in the hands. It's also supposed to be weather-sealed. But dont expect you can go running out in the rain with it though.  The 60D has a wheel insted of the four way buttons for moving within the menus and the photographs. So it's more easy to work with. It has an articulated LCD screen on the back, and an additional LCD on the top which displays the settings.  The mode dial on the 60D is on the left and its locked, so that you dont accidently move the dial. So everytime you change modes, you have to press a little button on top of the dial, hold it down, and then rotate.   Some of these are very minor differences. It might not be a dealbreaker for you. So I suggest you try out both the cameras, feel them on your hands, and then decide.   2.Specifications:  The 60D is faster than the 600D. It can shoot at 5.3FPS, while the 600D can only shoot at 3.7FPS. It has a faster shutter speed, 1/8000, compared to the 600D's 1/4000. It also has significantly more cross type focus points so that it can pull focus lot quicker than the 600D. It is also supposed to perform relativley better at higher ISOs, so you get less noise.  The 60D also packs a larger battery than the 600D. So it lasts a lot longer. You dont want to regret missing a great shot because you ran out of battery.  3. Price:  When it comes to the cost, athough they are almost the same, the price difference is a bit huge. I was able to find an offer (after a LOT of waiting) where I got both the 60D(with the 18-55 Kit Lens) and the 50mm f/1.8 Prime Lens for around 49k. If price does become a factor, then go ahead and buy the 600D. You won't be missing too much. You could rather invest on lenses later in the future.  The fact that the 60D is a little bit old doesnt matter really. When it comes to using DSLRs, investing in some quality glass is more important than having the latest body. As long as you have a good enough body and a quality lens, you're all set.  I also suggest getting the 50mm f/1.8 prime lens as far as possible, as it's worth every penny of the 6k you spend. It comes in handy for portraits and street photography as well, while the kit lens has you covered on most of your other needs.  Cheers!"}, {"upvote": 16, "content": "I am always blown away by the ready preference for a DSLR by amateurs.  You can get the comparisons between these two cameras easily and decide which features are important to you and which are not.  But the wide range of the photographs you're going to shoot aren't in the camera, but in how much you can grow as a photographer.  So, I'm going to suggest something else here.  Being able to compose quickly, and capture a picture, from a variety of perspectives is of paramount importance to the stories you're going to tell through photography.  For all of this, a smaller camera that you can pull out at any time is of great value.  Most DSLRs tend to be too heavy and if you add an extra lens, will become all that you're doing.  If a tripod is added to the mix, that's a kit you will have to carry along everywhere.  Before you can set up, the chap with a half decent cameraphone would have got the crucial shot, and the video, and walked away.  In many situations, a DSLR is the dumbest choice of camera, for the candid moments can slip by very quickly.  By the time you're up to speed on a heavy, feature rich camera, your mind will not be on the photography, it will be on managing the equipment.  This is exactly why a lot of DSLR starters are totally shitty photographers.  Of course you can leave it on the Automatic setting, which again begs the question - then what's the point of having a fully controllable camera?  My suggestion would be to get a lighter, mirrorless camera, which you can operate with one hand, put in difficult places, and get really trigger happy with.  Many these days have all manual controls, great image quality, and some even shoot RAW should you need.  But most of all, and here's where small sensor mirrorless cameras really win out for me - they have great optical zoom range.  This isn't useful for just shooting distant objects.  They give you amazing range of compositions, without having to change lenses, for which you will have to switch off the camera momentarily in DSLRs.  As for macro photography, DSLRs are comparatively ill equipped to get close to the subjects with the kit lenses, compared to even average mirrorless smaller sensor cameras.  Megapixels are no longer an issue, and processor speeds have all increased quite a bit across all cameras.  So, in your place, I'd research all mirrorless cameras, which almost always cost less than DSLRs, get the one with the best ergonomics and the highest optical zoom range.  I'd invest in a tripod, some basic lighting kit for shots you want to control a lot, and look for a BULB setting, in addition to all manual controls.  I'd get my visual storytelling skills up before I venture further.  There is much to discover in your personality and in your view of the world.  Photography can open the doors to these more important pursuits, only as long as the equipment doesn't get in the way.  A DSLR most certainly will when you start off.  Good luck.

In fact they've all been shot on an ancient Olympus."}, {"upvote": 3, "content": "I'd answer the question from a street photographer's perspective. If you have a budget for the 60D, go for it. Here's why-  1. Even if the 60D is a slight older model, the buid quality is better than the 600D.  2. 600D is targeted purely at amateurs while 60D is targeted at enthusiasts. (this point is not going to help you decide is it?)  3. The controls on the 60D are easily accessible and you'd find it very easy to change the settings of the camera in the Manual mode since you are going to opt for street photography.With the 600D, you are most likely to fiddle with the 4-way controller and dig deep in the menu for commonly accessed settings 4. The grip on the 60D is far more pronounced than on the 600D. Less painful for people who shoot long on the streets and have bigger hands. Also a boon if you are mounting a heavy prime lens (50mm 1.4/1.2). 5. Although the 60D and 600D both have a variable flip-out lcd, the 60D has a top plate lcd. This particularly helps a lot for when you want to click scenes which require you to bend a bit. Or if the subject is not at your eye's level. The top plate lcd can be used to get a glimpse of the settings.  6. The live view AF on both the cameras is slow. We've had dual pixel tech on the 70D (released in 2013) which is faster. So your kit lens might struggle a bit in low light while using the AF. So viewfinder + af shooting works best.   7. Videography on both the cameras is great. If you do get into shooting videos in the future, a 60D makes sense because of the accessible controls. 8. The 18-55mm kit lens is primarily aimed at stills and the 18-135mm lens is aimed at videography enthusiasts. I'd go for the body only and a 50mm f/1.8 (roughly 85mm fov on both the cameras because of the APS-c sensor) specifically for street portraits and 55-250mm for a good travel zoom. You won't need the kit lens unless you want to take pictures in your house/a place which requires a wide angle lens. And in the long run, you'd manage the composition on a 50mm lens in a more creative way rather than click a simple family portrait. 9. You really don't require an army of lenses in your bag while you are out on the street. The 50mm works just fine. Most street photographers I know either use fast af point and shoots (1\\\" sensors) or full frame cameras, with a single lens setup.   10. The 60D shoots ~5fps as apposed to the ~3.7 fps of the 600D. This also translates into a fact that the 60D has a slightly larger buffer capacity, so the camera can write more data inside the buffer before it finally slows down to write data on the sd card.  11. The viewfinder on the 60D is more clear and bright than that on the 600D. (Pentaprism %3E Pentamirror). While you wont get the difference at the first go, you'd never go back to pentamirror viewfinders once you've use a pentaprism.  If you are gonna opt for street photography, you'd need a fairly faster camera with a good grip, a clear and bright viewfinder, good autofocus, glanceble information of the settings and a fast lens setup. So in-case after 4 years, you wish to upgrade, you'd have no qualms upgrading from a enthusiast targeted camera body to a semi-pro/pro body.  Hope these points help you out in your decision.  And no, Canon is not used for dude type photography or to show off on social networking sites. Nor is Nikon used for criticizing canon users for doing dude type photography.

I believe only for this thing you can go ahead with 60D. Before you can wonder what is this let me just show two shots i took with this mode during last diwali  So now you got my point ? :P. You can create light painting, capture stars moving etc etc, which 600D cant  60D actually is the bridging gap between Professional and so called civilian version of cameras. I used to trek a lot, it is easy to handle and a few drops of rain did nothing to it. i have been using for about a year now no signs of any errors. I did drop also once accidentally from abt height of 5 feet no damage was caused, even though my friends say it is not for ROUGH USE types.  But i agree that i don't use it for any sort of videography as the pixels and FPS are comparitively low.  So in my words go ahead with 60D you wont regret for buying it.  Apologies for the typos"}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "Yes it is advisable. It will be helping him/Her to improve their talent on the Photography :-)"}, {"upvote": 3, "content": "I am a 600D user for about a year - so my answer is a bit biased.  On a quick price check on Amazon.in [ http://Amazon.in ], I see that (as on Oct 2014):  * 60D with 18-135mm lens costs 63k  * 600D with 18-135mm lens costs 52k (11k or $200 lesser)  You said your budget is 50k, so 600D is a clear winner right away.  60D, for the extra $200, comes with the following additional features. I am also including my opinions within brackets  *  A slightly larger viewfinder and probably slightly better build quality with water resistance features. (Did not matter - I never felt any pain using the 600D viewfinder and I don't drop it into water)  * 5.3 fps continuous shooting against 600d's 3.7 fps. That may be useful when doing sports photography (I rarely use continous shoot, and even if I shoot, 3.7 fps is more than enough)  * Has a small LCD at  top of body (never felt the need)  * Max shutter speed of 1/8000 of a second as against 600d's 1/4000 (1/4000 is more than enough)  For the extra $200, Canon 60D obviously comes with extra features and it is indeed a better camera.   But the point is : Does it change the game? I don't think so. I don't think any of the the \\\"extra features\\\" of 60D will be useful or necessary for an amateur photographer (even in the long run). Because the game-changing features such as sensor size, processor, image quality, etc are ALL THE SAME in both the cameras.  The shutter life is also the same on both the cameras (1 lac actuations - so at 20k clicks per year, your camera body will last for 5 years).   Youtube has multiple videos comparing  these 2 models. Most of the reviewers are like \\\"Hmm..you know,  well....its not much of a difference\\\"  So if I have to recommend, please choose 600D and if you have the additional $200, you can invest on add-ons such as   * the Canon 50 mm prime lens ($100) for its supreme image quality.   * a sturdy tripod  ($50) which you will need for anything outside \\\"normal\\\" photography.   * a good bag/case to protect your equipments.  Bottomline : Both the cameras are amazing and you can't go wrong. Its just a question of usage and economics. Photography/Cinematography is a rewarding but expensive hobby. So economy is important here - because every $ saved will help you buy additional equipments (lenses, flash, audio recorder,etc) which will change the game. Go for features that \\\"change the game\\\" rather than features that are \\\"slightly better\\\"."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "Thank you @Subhashish Bhattacherjee [ https://www.quora.com/Subhashish-Bhattacherjee ] for A2A.  Since you have mentioned amateur photographer so I believe you are not beginner and have slight knowledge of photographic concepts.  So lets begin.. First of all 600D  and 60D are two different level of camera also evident from their price difference. Out of above two EOS60D is a better camera overall with its better grip, better build quality , top LCD , unto 1/8000 of shutter speed.  Since you require camera for Street and travel photography then I will take a look at these two camera once again.  In street photography having a big camera does create problem and sometime gets in the way of you and your subject. Common people do get conscious of seeing big camera and can blow your cover & ruin your perfect shot.  I prefer carrying a small and light camera so i could reach as close to people w/o get noticed or bugging someone on street and easy on my shoulders too during long photo session. Also on the contrary sometimes camera happy people can notice you form distance from your big camera and start posing when you shoot also ruin the neutralness of the frame.  Most of the above are also true for Travel photography but for a holiday when carrying a big camera you can plan in advance and carry all you gear.   Verdict : ] 600D is better value for money than 60D  1. Same megapixel count and similar noise performance.  2. Lightweight. 3. Considerable lower in price (save more for better lens in future). for you i think 600D is more suitable.   Also Other options in price category of EOS60D is Nikon D7000.  It is very capable camera. Very good low light performance. Great metering and dynamic range. More advance autofocus system."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "First of all canon 60d is semi pro level dslr also 60d is better in performance cause it has 7 cross type focus points while 600d only has one cross type focus point .I'll suggest you to go for canon 600d cause it's way cheaper than canon 60d .if you are amateur photographer and starting your dslr photography I'll advise you to invest low on body and more on lenses. First learn how to get used to the settings for showing a different kinds of mood and when u get things right go for mark 3 or something . Lenses are going to stay with you for your entire lifetime .

As an amateur you should not be investing even 50k and if at all you are ready to do so then hopefully you may found my suggestion useful.

It differs from person to person that what are his priorities.  So there may not be any single answer to this question. But if we talk about LIC AAO vs SBI PO then  LIC AAO is better than SBI PO In almost all the respects.  In salary, In work pressure, In perks, In facilities, In coordination etc. But the points where LIC lags behind is promotions and Prestige. Actually promotions is quite obvious that banks have quite fast promotional processes than other sectors but as there is less public interaction of insurance sector as compared to Banking, and there is a hype that if someone is Bank PO and that too of SBI\\u2026OMG\\u2026 Then people will take him like Branch manager \\ud83d\\ude02  So more SIR, SIR like wordings you may get, if you choose SBI PO.  But more or less, the things that matters the most are in favour of LIC thats is the reason that why almost all of those who were selected in LIC as well as SBI, they choosed LIC over SBI.  Now, lets come to EPFO EO vs LIC AAO.  Epfo EO job is quite different from AAO.  But if are comparing these both then some things to keep in mind..  One of the most important thing to note here is that THERE IS A BOND OF 5.90 Lakhs in LIC, so those who are leaving the organisation before 4 year service have to pay for it.  Exception: IF YOU ARE SELECTED FOR RBI OR UPSC Exams, then you dont need to pay for it.  So those LICians who are going to appear in this exam are mainly for the same reason that they can leave the organisation (if they are not finding it interesting anymore) without paying for bond amount. As this is the easiest \\u2018Chase to Hunt' in UPSC for sure as of now.  Rest, EPFO EO is a good job in many respects. LIC AAO is also Ok Ok. \\ud83d\\ude02  1. You would be getting more salary as a EO than AAO. (As EO is level 8 job with 4800gp) 2. \\u2018Sukoon' is more in LIC than EPFO. 3. Social prestige of EPFO is more as compared to AAO. (As people take EO as an officer in Central Govt which is actually not true as employees of EPFO and ESIC aren't pure Central govtal staff) 4. Perks and facilities are more in LIC. 5. Promotional aspects are quite slow in EPFO. 6. No bond in EPFO so you may leave it whenever u want to leave while case is not the same in case of LIC.

I'll only promote the Bleach scans server that we're working on.  https://discord.gg/TUMMcvpHbR And the KSI server too  https://discord.gg/8vAFUtSFQK So onto the answer LMAO.   Before I make this answer, I want to address something.  Ichigo did indeed get his powers back or at the very least his Quincy powers.  Not only that but Ichigo in TYBW got his Zanpakuto basically restored by Tsukushima.  Now, if you pay attention to the first scan for a bit.  He basically made a completely different and alternate past where Ichigo's Zangetsu was never destroyed, think about it like this.  Let's say there's a past, a past that can't change, or anything like that because it already happened, and in front of the past is an infinite amount of possibilities, and as Yhwach states, the future to him appears like sand.  As he states, he can just pluck one grain of sand and change that, so because of that, ALL of those future timelines have been affected by Yhwach, and in basically every since one of them, he's destroy Zangetsu.  So what Tsukushima does, is create an alternate past, where Zangetsu was never destroyed, basically making new infinite timelines that Yhwach has never affected yet.  Basically all of this allows Orihime to revert the sword back to it's original form.   Now to ACTUALLY get onto the answer.  Due to all of this, we can say that EOS Ichigo most likely wins.  He was low end relative to a Yhwach as he was able to harm EOS Ichigo in the fight  Not only that but in the fight, he was able to severely harm Yhwach too  Not only that but Yhwach himself compliments Ichigo  And in fact, he even broke Ichigo's Zangetsu because it might have been overpowered.  Kenpachi is strong in his own right, he's stated to basically be the strongest Soul Reaper  (Won't beat Ichigo but).

I almost gave up too until i came across CryptoFXnetwork Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www . cryptofxnetwork . com) where i get profit on my invested cryptocurrency after 10 trading days. Don't be left out. Be like me. I still believe in Cryptocurrency. Please Note: This is me just telling you about my personal experience so far so good about investing on the only legit cryptocurrency investment platform i have seen online, I am in no way trying to advertise or give you a financial advise on how to spend your money. You can make your research and if you find the platform deem fit then you can go ahead just like i did.  When it was first launched, the price of the EOS cryptocurrency sat at $2.29. However, it then doubled in less than 24 hours, with EOS hitting $5.40.  This hike did not last, however, and the coin soon started falling, breaking one support level after another. EOS found its bottom at $0.59, which is where it remained until late October 2017. Once the crypto bull run that marked the year reached its peak, EOS joined the rally, and it skyrocketed to $16.39 on January 13, 2018.  However, while most coins peaked around this date or earlier, EOS' all-time high came later, in April 2018. In mid-April, the crypto market \\u2013 which had been crashing since January \\u2013 started seeing a new bullish wave. Prices started going up, and many assumed that the so-called 'crypto winter' was over.  These days, we know that the surge in April was only the eye of the storm, as the crash continued as May 2018 arrived. But, for those few weeks, the EOS price jumped once more, breaking its former record, and going up to $22.89. This was the coin's highest price, and it has never reached these highs again, at least so far.  Following this second surge, EOS kept dropping, briefly stopped by support here and there, but eventually, it dropped to its new bottom at $1.86 around December 7, 2018. In 2019, the coin saw gradual growth, although it progressed slowly, and everything it had achieved by mid-2019 was undone in the second half of the year, as it slowly returned to the level where it sat ever since \\u2013 between $2 and $2.8.  The EOS price has fluctuated in this range, except for on three occasions in 2020. The first one was between mid-January and mid-February, when it joined another bull run that took it to $5.35. The second was in August 2020, when it hit $3.7, and the last one is right now, led by Bitcoin (BTC), which is once again approaching its all-time highs at $20,000.  EOS, on the other hand, is as far away from its own record as it can be, hovering around $3.26.  What is happening to EOS these days?  Unfortunately, EOS has not been making headlines in 2020, as the crypto industry is mostly focused on the decentralised finance (DeFi) sector. When DeFi started slowing down, bull runs took over, and most of the attention went to Bitcoin.  However, that does not mean that EOS has been doing nothing. Its developers at Block.one recently announced the EOS Resource Model proposal, and the soon-to-arrive review of various talented organisations that responded to the company's invitation to evaluate their code.  Block.one also recently expressed its pleasure with how Spielworks built a rewards and loyalty platform for gamers using EOSIO.  The company also worked on adding new features to its Training and Certification segment of the blockchain.  And, of course, as a development platform, EOS has also been making moves to attract people to develop new DeFi projects on its network. The network already has quite a few successful projects, although the majority of the developers are still focusing on developing DeFi on Ethereum.  EOS price prediction 2021: what to expect from EOS going forward?  Lastly, we arrive at the most interesting part \\u2014 EOS coin price prediction for 2021 and beyond.  According to TradingBeasts, the EOS price in December 2020 will reach a maximum of $3.4, after which the forecasting service expects it to drop back down to $2.7, on average.  In January 2021, its EOS crypto price prediction shows the coin remaining near this level, at around $2.7, later expecting it to experience a slow but steady rise throughout the year, with the coin having the potential to hit a high of $3.9 next December. The average price of EOS is predicted to reach $4.07 in December 2022, and then $5.03 in December 2023.  Wallet Investor also expects the currency's price to rise in early 2021, although their EOS coin forecast says that the asset will see a price crash in the second half of the year. The event will potentially lead EOS down to $1.2 one year from now.  As for CryptoGround, they have a very bullish EOS prediction. In fact, their EOS forecast claims that the coin will simply keep climbing, with its value reaching $4.17 in six months, $4.7 in one year, and $21.4 by December 2025."}, {"upvote": 9, "content": "I have done some research about this cryptocurrency.Overall, there're a lot of compliments.

My focus on today's question will not be totally about the topic as the answer is incredibly easy. I will make this answer sweet and simple: yes. What is interesting is why this question even got asked in the first place. They were asked because traditional startup companies view blockchain for one thing and one thing only. Let's see if you can guess what it is by the end of this post.  A concurring problem that cryptofanatics face is traditional companies that do not understand blockchain trying to apply it to their business models or platform. The titular question is misleading in the sense that they don't mention why a company would even want to put themselves on the blockchain. If the question was Why would a traditional startup company want to do an ICO? It would be a much more interesting question.  Currently, there are over 3000 new ICOs coming out globally ever single month. There are two reasons why this number is so high:  1. The technology is much more accessible after a decade  2. Neophyte companies attempting to hop on the bandwagon.  The Problem With Traditional Startups:  The problem with traditional startups is that they believe in their products to the point of negligence. Now this isn't a problem unique to traditional companies. Many ICO's that we onboard have a habit of trying to speed up the process or launch something that is halfway complete. Just recently I had a company rush my team on the creation of the ANN and bounty thread. They paid for this mistake by not having enough participants, which means less free marketing and a lower chance for a successful ICO. Fortunately, we managed to multiply their Telegram channel fivefold and guaranteed them a successful launch.  Why do you think they were being so impatient? It's because at the end of the day, their company and livelihood lie in the darkness of uncertainty. That turns into FUD which in turn becomes a strange manic form of FOMO where the company demands quality output while they put in quantity inputs. If you check out Indiegogo, look at the success rate of tech projects that have come out in the last year. Their statistics show a rising number of failing crowdfunds. Too often it is due to a company rushing their launch date without having done quality control or penetration tests.  Why Blockchain?  The word blockchain has a different effect on mainstream ears than it does on the cryptoveteran. At this point in time, blockchain has become an effective buzzword. It is thrown around aimlessly and explained in ways so convoluted that Satoshi Nakamoto would turn in his grave. In reality, all blockchain is simply a decentralized ledger that confirms transaction based on the history of past transactions logged by intense algorithms. A cryptoveteran has experience choosing ICOs. They know that unless the platform has a use and a place, blockchain is not going to help their investments. They also understand that almost anything digital can be converted into blockchain form. What the veteran gets excited about is how applying blockchain will revolutionize a field. For example, the US has a huge problem with how its citizens access energy. NADGrid, WePower, and KWHCoin attempt to remedy this problem by opening up exchanges or creating a platform that allows you to track energy sourcing on the blockchain. These platforms will be incredibly useful in determining the politic and price of energy for years to come as tracking energy is highly lucrative and an unsaturated field.  For the traditional business, it is the complete opposite. Traditional startups are constantly looking for better ways to sell their product. By adding blockchain applications, startups believe they can ride the current bandwagon and hopefully create a communal buzz. What this leaves with is a huge cognitive gap between the actual users of cryptocurrency and the product itself. Nobody cares if you can put pictures of dogs on the blockchain. Nobody has use for a blockchain application that mimicks Disney Dollars. We were seriously pitched an idea where people use tokens only to pay for and log their train rides on the blockchain.  Conclusion:  So why is this question even asked in the first place? What is that one and only thing you mentioned in the intro?    A good ICO with a solid platform is a diamond in the rough. Their teams will usually be investing their own money and time in order to get a platform up and working before their ICO launch. Some brilliant developers have come to me desperate for investors because their marketing tactics were underperforming. They rarely talk about the price of their coin.  On the flip side, companies that are using blockchain to make a quick buck are popping up at an alarming rate. These companies will create hype about a project without fleshing out a GitHub or whitepaper. They will spend massive amounts of money running ads and getting placements. At the end of the day, they will have a successful ICO that raises millions of dollar. Unfortunately for the investors, the coin will crash a couple months later as their platform slowly falls to pieces and the developers quietly exit. The answer is easy money.  I hope I have provided some food for thought on the whole discussion of blockchain adaption. Unless your team has a solid platform and some bright ideas, the projects blockchain application will be nothing but a cheap fa\\u00e7ade of smoke and mirrors."}, {"upvote": 17, "content": "EOS is a modernized form of blockchain technology which aims at competing with Ethereum technology. It is a decentralized platform based blockchain and enables the users, organizations, and different entities to develop, and execute commercial-scale distributed and decentralized apps. (DApps) using same platform.  It is different from both Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of its design paradigm and technical implementation.  The term EOS has no officially declared full form. Moreover, the creators of EOS have also decided not to define this acronym and use it as it is formally. BlockOne has developed it; whereas, its core developer is BM (Daniel Larimer).  EOS has the ability to support all core and fundamental functionalities required by different businesses to enable themselves along with other people to make blockchain-based DApps in a similar fashion so that of the web-based applications.  These applications are hosted with functionalities like safe and sound access and authentication provisioning, permission, usage management, data hosting, and smooth communication between the end-users, DApp, and the Internet.  The EOS blockchain aims to build such a platform that can perform millions of transactions per second. These transactions are to be performed without any additional cost.  In EOS, blocks are produced by Block Producers, just like miners produce them in Ethereum. Once the blocks are generated, they are being paid by EOS blockchain instead of the users paying for them.  EOS blockchain system has a built-in inflation system that helps in the maintenance and proportion of an ecosystem. In EOS, two blocks are produced simultaneously every second. Out of these two, only one will be allowed to generate a block and the other producer who does not generate a block within a specific period and will be removed temporarily from the network."}, {"upvote": 3, "content": "Nothing.  Eos offers a lot more scalability than Ethereum. However, there is one difference that makes all the difference.  Eos is only so fast, because it is extremely centralized with only 21 nodes that vote. This is the one big difference that decides everything, because anyone can build a centralized, highly scalable platform there is no challenge in that. You just pick a normal database and build on it. There is no challenge in that.  The challenge is keeping it decentralized at scale and Ethereum and several other platforms, Cardano, Skycoin, Elastos are better in that. They are near infinitely decentralized through side-chains/off-chain/horizontal scaling.  Cardano and Elastos have managed to achieve that, EOS has not and its design prevents it from decentralizing in the future. Ethereum will roll out changes to their platform that makes it more scalable with Raiden Network and Casper.  How did they get to $9B in market cap then?  They raised $4B in their ICO. Well, they probably actually only raised $1B and sold their funds to rebuy tokens in their ICO again, thus ballooning their ICO to $4B.  Then, once the ICO was done, they used their funds to pump their own token from $4B to $9B.  There is not definite proof for this, but this is how it is suspected how their valuation can become so high, despite having bad tech.  Conclusion To sum it up, Eos pretends to be a 3rd generation blockchain even though it doesn't do the 1 thing that the blockchain was built for, being decentralized. That's why Eos is very overhyped and doesn't have a future in the cryptomarket and they most possibly only got to their valuation through pumping their own coin with their ICO funds."}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/Is-Canon-EOS-700D-is-good-for-professional-photography", "question": "Is Canon EOS 700D is good for professional photography", "answers": [{"upvote": 37, "content": "I'm an enthusiast photographer that don't make money from my photo, but I'm involved in unpaid serious photo projects very frequently, and most of the result from those projects are being published/printed. But even so, I don't consider myself to be a professional.  To me, the word professional is very ambiguous. The real meaning of the word \\\"professional\\\" is that you are making a living out of your photography, so in this case the camera must be able to produce photos with image quality that surpass the minimum photo-publishing requirements. In this case, a 700D with its 18MP Canon sensor that's also being used in the 7D meets the requirement, as the image quality produced by the 700D will satisfy at the very least the minimum standard requirement of many photographers; so it's safe to say it's good enough to be considered a \\\"professional camera\\\". A lot of low-budget studios where I live, which I consider to be professional photography studio, even still use the good-old 500D for passport headshots and similar stuffs, and they make money from it; that makes the 500D a \\\"professional camera\\\". I'm pretty sure that the photos from the 700D are also good enough to even get pass the very strict requirement of a lot of professional stock photography agencies. So there's that one kind of professional.    On the other hand, the assumed meaning of the word \\\"professional camera\\\" that the camera manufacturers and marketing departments tried to emphasize to us is the camera with the most feature packed with a very high price-level. Well, in this case, the 700D is not a professional camera, and the manufacturer will push you towards a 7D, 5D or 1D, in hope that you'll buy those products with a much higher margin to both cover the operational cost of the manufacturer and make more profit for the company. They don't care if you make a living out of your camera or not, but the 7D, 6D, 5D, and 1D are professional cameras. That's another kind of professional.  Now let's discuss the 700D specifically. I don't personally own the 700D but I used to own a 650D for one year, and it's spec'ed very similar to the 700D. The 650D/700D can shoot 18MP RAW or JPEG with a CMOS sensor that's very similar to the sensor on the high-end Canon 7D. It does shoot at 4 or 5fps burst image, it shoot 30fps video at 1080p, it has a decent viewfinder, and a good all-around control as well as menu.   Upgrading from a 650D/700D to a 7D, a \\\"professional\\\" camera, will give you faster burst image at 8fps, weather-sealing, better view-finder, more extensive manual control, and a heavier body. But it will not give you a better image quality.   Upgrading to a 5D Mark III will give you a somewhat cleaner image quality at high ISO, better control, better viewfinder, weather-sealing, better video output, but you're back with 5fps burst speed, and you'll have to invest to full-frame lenses.   Upgrading to 1D, you'll get 7D fast-performance with an almost-5D-like image quality, but it'll cost you as much as a used decent car.  Now the important question that you'll have to ask for yourself is: will you make more money if you have a 7D, 6D, 5D, or a 1D? Maybe yes, maybe no. But one thing for sure, you'll have to spend more money to buy those cameras than if you buy the 700D. Can you justify that? Do you really need to have those features on those so-called professional cameras, or can you live with just the features on the 700D?  I personally don't give too much thought about using the so-called professional cameras. As long as I can deliver the results needed by the clients or by yourself, I think I'm happy. My 650D could deliver the result that I require back then, and to my book, it's good enough. I don't know about you, nor do I know about your photography requirement, so I can't speak for you.  To conclude, I quoted a small part of David Thorpe's blog post with the title \\\"Is This Camera Professional\\\". David Thorpe is an ex-photojournalist from UK, a true professional photographer in my opinion. Here's that quote:   %3E When John Downing took the classic picture of a stunned Margaret Thatcher leaving the Imperial hotel in Brighton, England, after the IRA had bombed it, he had been having a drink in the bar. The bomb went off and John couldn't get to his room to get his \\u2018proper' cameras. But he he had a Canon Sureshot, the same as my mum used on holiday, in his pocket.  And it was on the Sureshot that the pic was made.  That makes it a professional camera in my book. Cameras are not professional, people are. An Olympus Pen in Sebastaio Delgado's hands is a professional camera. A Nikon D4 in my sister's is not.

A friend of mine got a solo show at a high-end art gallery, and he was using an ancient Rebel XT.  The main limitations of the 700D vs a xxD or xD line camera is the build quality / durability, and the ergonomics.

And with any camera you choose, always try to keep the camera out of \\\"automatic mode\\\" if possible so you begin to master the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  Point-and-Shoot or Camera Phone  These cameras are very inexpensive and with the newer smartphones, the camera is built right in and often takes better photos than the DSLR's from just a few years ago! This is the most inexpensive route to take (and may not cost a penny if you use the camera on your phone) and it helps you learn about composition, lighting, etc. If you're already past this point and want a camera you can grow into, the following are good options:  Traditional SLR's  I know, this is probably not what most people think of when deciding on a beginner's camera but I want to mention it because if you have one of these lying around in your house (parent's or grandparent's old camera, etc.), they're great for learning the basics of a camera with all of the digital stuff removed. SLR (single lens reflex) cameras aren't used much anymore because of the cost of operation, decreased photo quality, and lack of film processing labs, however, I think any aspiring photographer should own or at least use one because they are the \\\"original camera\\\", they are inexpensive, and they help give you a greater appreciation for the luxury of digital photography (not limited to 24-36 photos per roll, immediate results where you can see your photo seconds after taking it, easy and fast multiple frame shooting, and no cost by ruining a roll of film or wasting it on bad photos.) If you buy a traditional SLR 35mm camera, I'd go for something like the Nikon 35mm F2AS with a 50mm \\\"prime lens\\\", or similar. Here's a photo of one of mine:  Digital SLR's  Digital SLR's, or DSLR's, have been the most popular choice for many years now, they're easy to find used, and they're a good starting point in learning photography. These cameras are basically digital versions of the original SLR camera but offer much more flexibility and many more options. Whagt we're seeing right now, however, is a switch from DSLR's to \\\"mirrorless cameras\\\", including the very popular \\\"Micro Four Thirds\\\" cameras which use a smaller sensor, yet often outperform the DSLR's. I'll touch on those, below. Anyway, an inexpensive or used DSLR is a good choice for starting out and I'd recommend an entry level Canon DSLR such as one of the \\\"Rebel\\\" series cameras. I currently use a Canon 1DX which is NOT a beginner's camera, and my old Canon 5D Mark II (this is a great beginner's camera, easy to find, and inexpensive.) Here's a photo of the Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm prime lens attached:  Mirrorless Cameras  These cameras really are \\\"the future of photography\\\" although many professional photographers would scoff at you for even suggesting such a thing because just as it was when SLR's were phasing out, DSLR using pro's often get stuck in their ways and refuse to move with the times. Even today there are professional photographers who refuse to switch from SLR to DSLR! Mirrorless cameras are superior to DSLR's in almost every way: They have higher resolution (megapixels) for a fraction of the cost of DSLR's; there's no mirror flapping around making noise and causing camera vibration; they're smaller and easier to carry, many can shoot 4K and even Cinema 4K video (while Canon and Nikon refuse to adapt and offer this feature for a reasonable price in their DSLR's); and overall, they're less expensive. If you can afford one (they're often cheaper than many new DSLR's), go for it! I currently shoot with a Panasonic Lumix GH4 because I shoot photography AND I need to shoot 4K video and this camera does both. An even less expensive alternative is the Lumix GH3 which sells for around $500, a quarter of the price of the GH4. Here's a photo of the Lumix GH4, a \\\"mirrorless camera\\\":  Regardless of what you choose, unless it's a cheap $30 point-and-shoot or your phone's camera, try to make a decision on which camera format you want to grow into, otherwise you'll be wasting money on a camera and the expensive lenses that you'll end up not using when you switch to a different format.  Taking an introductory photography class or workshop is also a good idea when getting started as you'll more quickly learn the basics including aperture, exposure, shutter speed, composition, and editing.

This ensures the depth of focus is shallow which helps you isolate the person you're photographing from the background. Note that if you have a prime lens that can go as low as f/1.4 or f/1.8, that may be too shallow unless you're standing far back.  If you have a zoom lens, zooming in all the way can also help remove distractions in the background. Be sure to position the person such that distractions in the background are minimized (this is very important). Also, if the person has dark hair, don't frame their head against something dark as they'll blend into it. You want to person to stand out.  Your camera should be on \\\"Auto\\\" for ISO (e.g. light sensitivity) and your shutter speed will probably fluctuate between 1/60th second and faster automatically. If you keep getting camera shake in the shot, increase your ISO above the automatic value being selected by your camera (click INFO repeatedly while viewing the photo to see what ISO it used last and then double it).  For example: If you set your camera to 5.6 (typical aperture for a t2i kit lens fully zoomed in), then you shutter may be 1/60th at an ISO of 400. If you get camera shake style blur, then change the ISO from Auto to ISO 800. Now the shutter will be at 1/125th which is better for freezing some motion by you or the subject.  Finally, make sure the image is bright. It's easy to underexpose photos that have large light-coloured backgrounds. If this is the case, use exposure compensation via the Quick Menu. Move the dash that's below a \\\"0\\\" up a few notches. Going to \\\"+1\\\" is doubling the amount of light you let in which may be too much so it lets you go in 1/3 increments. This part is trial and error.  Final tip for composition: Shoot what you feel looks good and then get closer and shoot again... and repeat. You will probably find the closer ones are better. Go so far as to cut off the person's forehead in your closest composition. Just don't go too close to their chin.  Lastly, have fun!"}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "Use the longest focal length your zoom lens allows. This compresses the perspective and makes anything you shoot flatter.  Make sure the person's face and/or problematic areas are never in the edge of the frame.

That can be caused by bad posing or a bad lens choice. Cheap wide angle lenses can cause barrel distortion which will cause a subject to look distorted.  More than likely though it is bad posing.

You REALLY have to work at it to screw them up!  The challenge comes as a person gets older. You have to strike a balance between making them look their best while avoiding the plastic Barbie doll look from over processing the photo.  I do have preferred settings but they are not locked in stone. I prefer ISO 100, f/5.6 and the shutter speed that will allow those settings.

A photographer can yell at a model he is paying, so they tend to use even longer lenses, as much as 300mm, which again makes them look a little skinnier.

With your Canon DSLR, and the 18 - 55 mm kit lens take three photographs like this.  1. Set the lens to 18mm (or the shortest focal length you have) and move near to the subject until the face fills the entire frame. Take the shot. 2. Set the lens to about 35mm and again move until the subjects face fills the frame and take the shot. 3. Now set the lens to 55mm or the highest focal length you have. Again move back until the entire face is in the frame and take the shot. Look at all three images and you will see that image 1 distorts the face and makes it chubbier than it really is. Image 2 should be around the most real image of the subject and image 3 will give a generally more flattering image than reality.  This distortion can be even more noticeable if you take a shot aimed down at the subjects face from a position above the subjects head, or aimed up at the subjects face from a position some way below the subjects chin.  Personally I like shooting portraits using a focal length between 80 and 135 mm on a crop sensor DSLR and make sure you focus accurately on the subjects nearest eye. Avoid straight-on shots. I like the camera to be 6 to 12 inches above the subjects head, and to have the head turned enough that I can only see the edge of the turned away ear.  When you can get decent, flattering portraits following the above advice, then you are ready to experiment with different aperture settings to blur the background and isolate the subject.  Good luck."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "It might not be your camera settings. It could be the focusing compression factor on your lens. Do you use a zoom lens or a fixed focal length for your portraits? If you aren't using a fixed focal length lens, the lens glass of your zoom lens can somewhat distort the facial features of your subject in certain shooting instances.

The larger the aperture, the shallower the depth of field, and the more separation there will be between the subject and background.  If you need to step your aperture down to get a slightly larger depth of field, you can slow the shutter speed down accordingly to retain a well-exposed image.  As regarding ISO, a general rule, it's a good idea when shooting portraits to use a higher ISO, say, 400, as opposed to 100 or 200. Doing so enables you to use smaller apertures if needed, and also allows you to use faster shutter speeds. Higher ISO values are needed for low-light shooting as well.  Modern cameras have sophisticated metering systems that help you get the exposure as close to perfect as possible. But those metering systems aren't foolproof so you can use exposure compensation to fix such issues.  Exposure compensation allows you to add or subtract exposure levels from your shots. So, for example, if you're taking a portrait of a person with fairly light skin, the camera's meter might think that the scene is brighter than it is, which usually results in an underexposed image. To rectify the situation, you can add a stop or two of positive exposure compensation. What this does is lighten the subject's face to be more reflective of the actual lighting in the scene:  https://youtu.be/O-H2IbHluLg "}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "You are most likely using a wide angle lens. Probably 35mm or less equivalent.  This causes distortion (Big nose small ears etc.)  Try to use a minimum of 100mm equivalent, you will obviously need to move further away to get your shot.

Typically, a lens equivalent to 85\\u2013100mm on full-frame is used for a head and shoulders portrait. I'm not quite sure what you mean by chubbier but if faces look too broad, you could try getting closer and using a shorter focal length.

Both cameras under consideration feature an APS-C sensor, but their sensors differ slightly in size.The sensor area in the D3400 is 11 percent bigger. As a result of these sensor size differences, the cameras have format factors, respectively, of 1.6 (1300D) and 1.5.  If the front view area (width x height) of the cameras is taken as an aggregate measure of their size, the Nikon D3400 is notably smaller (7 percent) than the Canon 1300D. Moreover, the D3400 is markedly lighter (8 percent) than the 1300D. In this context, it is worth noting that neither the 1300D nor the D3400 are weather-sealed.  The above size and weight comparisons are to some extent incomplete since they do not consider the interchangeable lenses that both of these cameras require. Yet, since both cameras are based around an APS-C sensor, their respective lenses will tend to have similar dimensions and heft. You can find an overview of optics for the two cameras in the Canon EF Lens Catalog [ https://www.apotelyt.com/photo-lens/canon-ef-catalog ] (1300D) and the Nikon Lens Catalog [ https://www.apotelyt.com/photo-lens/nikkor-af-catalog ](D3400).  Concerning battery life, the 1300D gets 500 shots out of its LP-E10 battery [ https://www.apotelyt.com/camera-power/canon-1300d-battery ], while the D3400 can take 1200 images on a single charge of its EN-EL14a power pack [ https://www.apotelyt.com/camera-power/nikon-d3400-battery ].

If you want to switch the focus of the display and review another camera pair, just move across to the CAM-parator tool [ https://www.apotelyt.com/cam-parator ]and choose from the broad selection of possible camera comparisons there.  Advantages of the Nikon D3400:   * More detail: Has more megapixels (24 vs 17.9MP), which boosts linear resolution by 16%.  * Maximized detail: Lacks an anti-alias filter to exploit the sensor's full resolution potential.  * Better video: Provides higher movie framerates (1080/60p versus 1080/30p).  * Faster burst: Shoots at higher frequency (5 vs 3 flaps/sec) to capture the decisive moment.  * Longer lasting: Gets more shots (1200 versus 500) out of a single battery charge.  * More modern: Was introduced somewhat (5 months) more recently. If the number of relative strengths (bullet points above) is taken as a guide, the D3400 is the clear winner of the contest (6 : 2 points). However, the relevance of individual strengths will vary across photographers, so that you might want to apply your own weighing scheme to the summary points when reflecting and deciding on a new camera.  In any case, while the comparison of the spec-sheets of cameras can offer a general idea of their imaging potential, it says nothing about, for example, the handling, responsiveness, and overall imaging quality of the 1300D and the D3400 in practical situations.

Thus, when you look at a lens, try to remember to automatically multiply it's given focal length by 1.6. This makes the 50mm an 80mm equivalent, and the 100mm a 160mm equiv (and the 180mm is a whopping 288mm!)   In addition to being a good starter macro lens, the 50mm is also at just the right length on your camera for some excellent street and portrait photography. Makes a great general purpose 50mm lens if you don't yet have a 50mm f/1.8 IS STM. And, if you watch craigslist, eBay, etc carefully, you can probably get one for about $100-150 USD.  Hope this answers your question."}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "I would start with one of these (1) Canon EF-S 60mm macro - if closer distance from subject is not a problem.

Canon makes five macro lenses native to your camera: MP-E 65mm, EF 50mm, EF 100mm, EF 100mm IS and EF 180mm.  Best bang for buck would be the Canon EF 100mm Macro IS USM. If you don't mind not having image stabilisation, there is a non-IS version of the lens that is cheaper (and uses a 58mm filter diameter so your 18-55mm lens filters would work with it). The MP-E 65mm is a specialised lens that only focuses as far as 1:1 reproduction, and goes up to 5x life size. The 50mm only goes up to 1:2 reproduction and the 180mm is the most expensive of them all.  If you want to use your existing collection, consider bellows and lens extenders, as increasing the distance between lens and camera effectively shifts your focal plane closer (i.e. more macro). Ultimately, reversing your lens can turn it into a super macro lens. These solutions, however, have an impact on image quality because they're not designed for macro photography.

These allowances are not the same for all the EPFO officers and they might vary based on the different Govt. Departments where the Enforcement officer or EO gets posted.  Breakdown of allowances:  1. House Rent Allowance or HRA 2. Transport or Travel Allowance (TA) Both HRA (House Rent Allowance), and Transport Allowance or TA are location dependent and usually vary based on the location of posting (class X, class Y or class Z). Class X - The 8 metro cities constitute class X (formerly class A-1).  Class Y consists of around 100 towns in India with a population above 5 lakh people and below 50 lakhs.

The HRA is roughly 27% of basic pay amounting to IR 12,852 per month. In cases where the Dearness Allowance or DA exceeds 25% of the basic pay then the HRA is given at 27% of Basic pay.  3. Dearness Allowance or DA  Dearness Allowance is directly linked with the consumer price index (CPI). This basically means that the DA component of the salary is variable and it increases proportionally with the CPI every year.

Many aspirants have been asking me about how to go about the preparation strategy. In this answer, I would just be focussing on some broad details without referring any book or any website.  1)Difference between last EO/AO Examination and this time  -Weightage of written marks and interview in the final result in last EO/AO examination was 50:50.  -Weightage of written marks and interview in the final result in this EO/AO examination would be 75:25.  Thus the weightage of written exam has increased a lot. Accordingly, those clearing written examination with good score can make it to final list even with normal interview marks.  2)Cut-off marks  Recruitment Test (100 marks)  UR -49.50  OBC -44.50  SC - 42.50  ST - 43.50  PH(OH)- 30.00  PH(HI)- 33.00  Thus , as you can see the cut off marks were on the lower side indicating that exam was of decent level and not easy.  3) Analysis of last time EO/AO Examination  It is a good practice to go through how the paper was last time regarding its composition and difficulty level. Though it cannot be said that the same would be replicated this time,but it give a fair idea about the exam. It was a 120 questions paper(link of the paper is attached [ https://www.upsc.gov.in/sites/default/files/GENERAL_ABILITY_TEST_EPFO.pdf ]). So let's go through the last time paper in terms of prescribed syllabus:  (i)General English- To evaluate candidate's understanding of English language & workman \\u2013 like use of words.  20 questions were there. The questions asked were  a) Synonym of the word in sentence- Direct synonyms were not asked. Thus focus was on application part rather than just memory. Even if you do not know the exact meaning, you can gauge it from the line  b) Antonym of the word in sentence- Direct antonyms were not asked. Thus focus was on application part rather than just memory. Even if you do not know the exact opposite meaning, you can gauge it from the line.  c) Error in the line- The focus was on application part.  d) Substitute for the Phrase- The focus was on application part.  e) Fill in the blanks- The focus was on application part.  Thus , the focus was more on application part rather than testing the exact knowledge of rules of grammar or comprehension . The same was mentioned in syllabus too. This was a scoring area for candidates with decent English knowledge.  (ii) Indian Freedom Struggle.  15 questions were asked from this part.The questions asked can be categorised difficult. There were no easy pickings here. It even beat the level of questions asked in Civil services examination. Even if a candidate had gone through books like Bipin Chandra or Rajiv Ahir( read for Civil Services), some questions were difficult to answer. Thus it was an area to sail without attracting negative marks( remember negative marking is high at 1/3rd rather than 1/4th as in SSC). Thus one needs to be careful.  (iii) Current Events and Developmental Issues.  7 questions were asked from this part. The questions were relatively easy. Study from any decent source would have provided the answers. Though the weightage was quite low. One can expect more questions from this part.  (iv) Indian Polity  5 questions were asked from this part. The questions were of average level, which is the case with any UPSC paper. Though the weightage was quite low. One can expect more questions from this part.  (v) Indian Economy.  8 questions were asked from this part. 4 of them were core theoretical questions. Someone who has read basic theory of economy would have find these questions as lottery, others might have struggled. Overall average level as with any UPSC paper  (vi) General Accounting Principles.  15 questions were asked from this part. The questions asked were odd in the respect that some of them would have been difficult even for commerce graduates to answer. Understandably, Science/ Arts background students would have find it even more difficult. Overall, can be categorised as difficult. Thus it was an area for Science/ Arts background students to sail without attracting negative marks. The weightage given was high compared to other such exams taken by UPSC.  (vii) Industrial Relations & Labour Laws and Social Security in India.  20 questions were asked from this part. The weightage given was high compared to other such exams taken by UPSC. Almost half of the questions were from Core theoretical base. Then some from Indian context and 2\\u20133 current affair based on Social Security. Overall average level.  (viii) General Science  10 questions were asked from this part. The questions asked were from Core theoretical base rather than current based.Overall average level.  (ix) Knowledge of Computer applications.  5 questions were asked from this part. The questions were very easy. A scoring area for candidates.  (x) General Mental Ability & Quantitative Aptitude.  15 questions were asked from this part. Questions of Time , Speed, distance, profit/loss etc were asked. Not much reasoning was asked. The questions were of average difficulty level. Those who have prepared for Quant for UPSC/SSC/Bank PO would have found them scoring. Those trying to solve them with common sense and not through formula would have taken a lot of time.  Overall Advice  1. Don't rush through basic theories as UPSC has knack of focussing on them. 2. Speed is not much of a factor ( except Quant Part) unlike in exams like SSC. So attempt your exam in a calm manner. 3. Remember there are 120 questions( not 100). In civil services examination conducted by UPSC there are 100 questions, thus some candidates preparing for civil services examination might carry that impression. 4. Try to go through your paper at least 3 times. In first go, only attempt those questions about whom you are at least 90% confident. In second go, attempt those questions about whom you are at least 60% confident. In last go, the rest. You would be amazed that during the third reading you would recall the answers of some of those questions which were unanswerable in first reading. It is the power of subconscious mind. 5. Don't panic if you find paper difficult in first reading. Remember, its a relative exam and not absolute. Difficult exam is difficult for everyone and easy exam is easy for everyone. The one holding his/her nerves in exam hall has a much better chance. 6. Mark you answers after every reading. Do not wait till end to mark your answers. Many candidates do it in a rush in last times only to fill circles wrongly. 7. Give particular attention to what question is asking. like to identify correct or incorrect answer. Many candidates rush through the question and mark wrong answer despite knowing the correct answer. 8. For science/Arts background students, go through accounting related basic concepts from a decent book without going much in detail. Remember , UPSC is not allowing you calculator , thus only broad questions would be asked. 9. For Arts background students, work on your Quant. part. ( Normally, Quant is not their forte). 10. Take care of negative marking as it is 1/3rd. 11. Don't go into examination hall without practising decent number of mock test. It means giving them in almost same conditions you would face in examination hall.

Work is a mix of field and desk job. While in field, an Enforcement Officer has to visit industrial establishments to perform various inspections. EPFO scheme should be followed in companies otherwise penalty can be imposed on them. So, job is respected but at the same time, EO has a lot of responsibility. While in desk profile, work is normal such as noting, drafting, files, administration work etc.  Coming on to Salary,  Basic salary is 47600 per month  Dearness Allowance is 17% of basic pay but when you join it will be more than 30%  HRA = 24% of basic pay  Travelling allowance is 3600, then there is DA on TA (17% of 3600)  So, In-Hand salary for a newly-joined Enforcement Officer is more than 60,000 per month.  Also , NPS : Government contribute 14% of (basic pay+DA) which is a part of gross salary. So, monthly gross salary is around 76000\\u201377000.  Note: When you guys join in 2021 , DA would be around 30% and HRA would be 27% . So, add 4000 - 5000 to your in-hand salary.  An Enforcement Officer get Government accommodation facility, CGHS facility, CGEGIS facility, briefcase facility and other perks.  Overall , the job is worth preparing for. It is not a 24 hour job. Normal working hours in office. On field, little bit more.  My book Super simplified EPFO Enforcement Officer / Accounts Officer 2020 is going to be released in January 2021.

As soon as I entered the interview room they welcomed me with big smile which made me very much comfortable, I could relax. As soon as I sat down my basic details were asked though everything was written on my DAF form . Anyway that's for the candidates benefit itself as it helped me ease up a bit. Following are some of the questions asked :  1. Where did you work previously?  2. What does your previous designation 'trainee decision scientist ' mean?  3. What is big data? How can big data be useful for a country like India?  4. Is working in startup better or in an established industry?  5. What is artificial intelligence?  6. What is reason for you to quit your job and join this service?  7. What are the pros and cons of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana bifurcation?  8. Which genre of books and movies do you watch?

CAPF AC is a Gazzeted Post whereas Even APFC in EPFO is not a gazetted Officer. 2.

And I think they made some good decisions, and a few bad ones that may have not been choices as much as technical limitations.  Neither Canon nor Nikon were actually new to mirrorless with last August's introductions. But the R and the Z are professional formats, even if the first models are not a match for the top-of-the-line DSLRs yet. Both Canon and Nikon took on the idea that mirrorless was something less than DSLR, a step between DSLR and compact digital cameras (aka point and shoot). Nikon's 1 system used the same 1\\u2033 sensor size found in high-end P&S cameras like the Sony RX10 and RX100. But Canon put out a very compact APS-C system with their EOS M. And a funny thing happened: while Nikon's 1 system is now defunct, the EOS M is very popular, albeit not necessarily in the USA. Canon's been the #2 mirrorless brand in Japan in 2016 and 2017 (BCN rankings, second to Olympus) and looks to be taking the #1 spot for the 2018 year\\u2026 without even counting the EOS R. Canon seems to have nailed the consumer mirrorless ILC with the EOS M.  So it should be no surprise that Canon got into mirrorless on a higher level with the EOS R, but then again, it should be. Canon is slower to react to competition than just about anyone. Why this, why now? Canon feels the competition.  For most of history since maybe the 1940s or 1950s, Canon and Nikon had much of the professional market for cameras. In the 1960s, led by Nikon, they won an 80% share, and it's been pretty much 80\\u201390% ever since. Canon managed to flip the market share on Nikon by being the first to court consumers, and then by delivering the fastest speeds for pro sports shooters. But for a long time, the only 35mm, then full-frame choice for most pros was Nikon or Canon.  This last year, the whole industry sold only 11.6 million ILCs, less than half of those sold in 2013. And 2017 was actually an 8% increase from 2016. But more the point, DSLRs sold only accounted for 65% of the ILC market\\u2026 clearly, Nikon and Canon were no longer winning an 80\\u201390% share. And while Canon's mirrorless sales were up 70% in 2017, Nikon wasn't even part of that. And of course, neither was competitive with Sony, Olympus, Panasonic, or Fujifilm in higher-end mirrorless. No one knows just where the DSLR vs. mirrorless ratio settles out in the long term, but it's not going to be terribly favorable to any company only making DSLRs.  What's It For?  If you look carefully at the EOS R, like the Nikon Z's, you'll know just what it's for: the EOS R is a mirrorless body for Canon users to buy, so that they don't buy Sonys. This is the big factor. Canon users have been trying Sony A7s with adapters, and liking them. Some keep it as an accessory, but some sell their Canon gear and move to Sony. Canon needs that to stop, and their first reaction to this situation is the EOS R.  Canon's introducing one body and four lenses, two of them quite expensive, but still, that's not a full system for nearly anyone who needs a system camera. It's a start. But if you're already a Canon shooter, the R is with an adapter is going to let you try out mirrorless with all of your glass \\u2014 even EF-S lenses, but EF-M lenses are impossible \\u2014 your existing batteries and flash units, etc. It's a much simpler way to experiment with mirrorless for today's Canon shooter. If you're new to ILCs and want full-frame mirrorless, EOS R won't be a great option for at least 3\\u20135 years, depending on how quickly Canon rolls out new glass.  So you're supposed to compare the EOS R to a Sony A7 Mark III, but the closest match is actually the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV. So you're getting more or less a mirrorless 5D Mark IV with some improvements/extra features for $900 less. That's a pretty fine deal, speaking from the Canon universe. It's a bit more expensive than the A7 Mark III, but no one's more aggressive on body pricing than Sony.  I think it succeeds in its mission. If I still had my Canon system and was ready for full frame mirrorless, the EOS R is a no-brainer versus the Sony. It's not even the cost of the bodies or the minute details of the features, but the fact it's already part of my system. The cheap lens adapter is only $100, and it works perfectly. For a bit more, I could get the adapter with filter holder, simply brilliant for video work.  Video Issues  Alas, on that latter one, Canon's still being Canon, and not in a good way. They're still crippling 4K video on the EOS R, delivering the same 1.7x crop you have on the EOS 5D mark IV. If you're buying a full-frame DSLR for video, the point is to have full frame video. With that crop, you're better off going to a Panasonic GH5 or a Blackmagic Design Pocket Cinema Camera 4K, depending on your needs.  I expect for most stills work, you have a 5D Mark IV as far as the quality goes. You won't quite match Sony in very low light, but you'll have a bit more resolution in bright light, so it's probably not a big deal for most photographers. You'll have the Canon color, which Sony has yet to match, and the Canon menus you're used to\\u2026 well, maybe. They have a few new controls on the camera, which changes around the way its used. There's a programmable ring control on lenses, but you won't run into that with adapted EF lenses unless you get the third adapter, the one with the ring control. There's also a touch strip on the back, which most reviewers aren't yet crazy about.  Neither Sony nor Canon has 10-bit in-camera video, which is what you need for serious Log shooting. But the EOS R does have that as an external option, at least. I'd bet on Sony's A7S Mark III offering 10-bit in some fashion, but like Canon, Sony's got their own cinema camera business they feel compelled to protect by crippling the mirrorless models. Oddly, though, Nikon opted for the same thing, in-camera 8-bit, external 10-bit, even without a video market to protect. I guess that leaves them both with a feature to add to a higher end model, next year. Or save money and buy the GH5 right now.  Conclusions  So basically, I think the EOS R is attractive to anyone with a full Canon system thinking about mirrorless. If Canon's annoying behaviors haven't driven you away yet, this may well be your mirrorless. I don't really find any huge problems with it. Knowing that Sony was the initial target, nothing about the EOS R or the Nikon Zs were particularly unexpected. Both aim for the Sony's, Nikon at both the A7III and the A7RIII, Canon's basically doing the A7III competitor now. I would hope they're holding off an A7RIII competitor until they have some improved sensor tech, probably also going into the EOS 5DS Mark II."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "This is a step off the earth and on to the moon for canon.  The look , the feel, the buttons and the methods used to get the shot make shooting a lot more fun , enjoyable and in some ways give you a sense of being part of the camera rather than that feeling of just holding a candle.  So click point and shoot is now click twist,, turn point and shoot and twist thanks to the RF lens that allows you to change the ISO ect .  This is a game changer for both those that shoot video and stills obviously.  There are many that feel that this new generation of Canon Twisties are a step in a new way to shoot, and I think they are right, I have found it to be lot more fun.  The Camera is great but the slow motion in 720 is painful and exhausting and we all lust for an update hoping that changes.  The cropped 4K is Canon lazy way out of the mess over heating and keeping the D1x alive and well until the next flagship.  I really like 2K looks amazing on the 30 inch screen and that is what I shoot for.  The view finder is Refreshing , and relaxing because you see all your changes come to life quickly , no need to worry about the sun hitting the touch screen.  The touch screen is a flippy one and we all fool ourselves by thinking we can get around this with something bigger and heavier but the truth is that flippy screen is priceless.  The Nikon Z6 is a fantastic camera but without that Flippy Screen all the slow motion and 4K goodness fades away quickly.  Now the expense of the Canon Lens , that feels more like a wooden stake through the Heart , makes me wonder why they just dont give these camera away knowing your about to shell out $4500 to 10 grand for lenses.  With this new Canon your not as much investing in the best camera as your investing in a new and exciting way of shooting video and pictures.  Which leads me to the Multi Task Bar , so this seems sketchy at first until I realized what its strength was and that was it ability to reset the button so quickly but placing your thumb over it entirely , this was cool. .  Dragging the Auto Focus with your thumb is also another aspect of being part of the the camera rather than button pushing.

It's a turning point in the manufacturer's history. They were relatively late to produce SLRs (Nikon and Pentax were the big manufacturers of the 1960s, while Canon was known for rangefinder cameras), and they're relatively late into mirrorless cameras. But they're here to stay.  Thoughts:   * It's not nearly as exciting as the Nikon Z7. In particular, the frame repeat rate is surprisingly slow.  * As a result, I don't think it will be around very long. My guess is that there will be a new, compatible camera within 12 months. We'll see whether it replaces the EOS R or complements it.  * The new lens mount is not compatible with the EOS M. This tells me that the EOS M will be discontinued quite soon. I won't be buying one. I don't believe that full frame cameras are the way of the future; they're just a fashion.

Those edges are then highlighted by the camera so you can more easily distinguish what's in focus and what isn't.  Though focus peaking has been around for a long time, it's a new thing for Canon's non-cinema cameras.

Let me give you this piece of advice: your camera is the least important thing in your camera bag. Lenses and lighting are far more important, and by far the most important piece of gear is the one between your ears. Invest your money accordingly.  A 5DS r is going for $3,700 new. An EOS R is going for $2000 for just the body. So I'm going to say your total budget is around $4500. A good rule of thumb is to spend 30% of your budget on the body and 70% on lenses. That gives you a budget of around $1350 for a camera body.  As a novice, you just don't need the capabilities of a state of the art camera. I have a 5D mark IV, and honestly 95% of the time any one of my older cameras (5D mark II, 7D, 50D) is going to do the job well enough.  Bottom line is that any pro-grade DSLR made in the last 10 years is going to serve your needs perfectly well. Save your money and buy a used 5D mark III ($900-$1200) or even a 5D mark II ($500\\u2013$800). Some reputable dealers for used equipment are B&H, Adorama, Abe's of Maine, KEH, and 42nd Street Photo.  Pair that body with a good general-purpose zoom lens like the EF 24\\u201370 f/4L IS ($900) to start with. The only other must-have accessories you need with that are a circular polarizing filter (around $100) and good tripod. That is a great kit to get you started learning photography.  Save the rest of your money for now until you reach the creative limits of your initial kit\\u2026 You shouldn't buy anything you don't have a specific need for. You might also seriously consider taking some of the money you save and spending it on some photography classes at your local community college.  What your second lens is going to be depends on the direction you go with your photography. My second lens was the EF 100 f/2.8L macro because I was limited in my ability to do flower pictures by not having a macro lens. My next several purchases were lighting gear. I've bought other pieces of equipment over the years to add new capabilities to allow me to do things I couldn't do with the equipment I had at the time. Avoid the temptation to buy things just because they're new and shiny.

Some possible causes of graininess:   * Shooting at too high an ISO and/or no noise reduction. The higher the ISO the higher the noise.  * Setting camera to shoot in low-quality JPG or SRAW mode versus full resolution RAW files  * Image artifacts caused by excessive sharpening or noise reduction  * Underexposed images that are being corrected with software (EG over-reliance on the Auto-lighting optimizer setting versus using fill light) Other causes for low image quality:   * Shooting at too low of a shutter speed with a unstabilized lens. Without IS, your lowest hand-held shutter speed is approximately the reciprocal of the focal length, e.g. 1/100 with a 100mm lens. With 4 stops of IS, your minimum shutter speed would be 1/7 sec. IS eliminates blurring due to camera motion but not due to subject motion.  * Using a low-quality lens with insufficient resolving power for the sensor  * Bad post-processing technique You would have to provide a sample image and full EXIF information in order to identify the cause."}, {"upvote": 15, "content": "Is Canon EOS RP Worth buying?

Now the question is why do people say that this camera has poor specs? Because people only focus on specs and not on what they can do with the camera. I have seen about 99% of the time camera is better than the photographer who uses it. Several decades ago when I was starting out with manual focus SLRs, I was hoping that a better camera will help me overcome my deficiencies. Alas, that's what all photographers think ie. they need a camera which can magically make them better without they learning to become great.  People may say this camera has got still photo shooting burst rate of 5 frames per second. I use a Canon EOS 1DXII which is canon's top of the line still photography camera. However, I rarely use 12fps burst. I shoot a max of 2\\u20133 frames at a time. If you know what you are doing, then you don't need to adopt the spray and pray mode ie keep on pushing the shutter button and hoping that one shot will be great.  If I have to do street shooting or kind of mountain climbing then this kind of small and light body will help.  Every camera company has to differentiate their offerings and keep some of the top notch specs for their high end bodies. Else, why will anyone buy a high end body? If you can extract every drop of juice from this body, then you can become a great photographer and then obviously you can buy the other expensive cameras. Till then do with this."}, {"upvote": 12, "content": "This depends on what existing camera you have, or if you are a first time buyer, and what you intend to use the camera for. You cannot get a specific answer with a generic question. I have just bought a 6D Mark II. I have had the original 6D for nearly three years. I shoot live music in mostly small, badly lit venues. When I bought the 6D it was Canon's best low-light camera (even better than the 5D MkII and 1DX). It was also very affordable for someone who makes very little money working in a sector with very little money. It was an upgrade from a 550D (APS-C). I had one EF-S lens for that camera \\u2013 a Tamron 17\\u201350 f/2.8 that was my go to lens. My 70\\u2013200 f/2.8 was an EF. When I upgraded, I bought a used Canon 24\\u201370 f/2.8, and a friend sold me his 16\\u201335mm f/2.8 at a bargain price. I now had a full range of full-frame lenses that I needed for the 6D. That camera has now taken close 30k photos, but no video, so I was feeling the need to get a new body (as in camera, although the physical one could do with an upgrade too) when the EOS-R was announced. Personally, I'm not overly convinced about the hype over mirrorless cameras (I do have an EOS M2 as a pocket camera), probably because I have been using an SLR since the 1970s and they have never failed, and I mostly see mirrorless as a marketing ploy to sell more gear.  I looked at the same options you have asked about and asked myself if I wanted to use a body almost identical to the one I was currently familiar with, but upgraded, or go for a new technology with a new lens mount. I then looked at my bank account and prices of the two options. I found a new 6D MkII and battery grip for under \\u00a31100. It was not a difficult decision at that point. A new camera body that would use all my existing lenses without needing an adaptor, and without the need to familiarise myself with a new body and way of working, as well as using a new system in its first iteration that would need regular firmware updates. During my next upgrade cycle I may opt for the EOS-R as all the bugs will have been sorted, and my lenses will probably need upgrading as well by then.  So, as you can see, there is no definitive answer. My advice is to never buy a camera purely from the spec sheets, or people's reviews either. You need to actually hold them in your hands and use them in the situation you intend to use them most. Don't buy a camera that is over-specced for what you are shooting. For example, do you really need a full-frame camera? If you mostly want to shoot video, would an actual video camera serve you better? And always look at your budget, and don't spend more than you need to, especially if it's a hobby.  Hope all this helps."}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/What-should-be-the-approach-to-prepare-for-UPSC-EPFO-AO-EO-interview", "question": "What should be the approach to prepare for UPSC EPFO AO EO interview", "answers": [{"upvote": 0, "content": "One should read the newspaper daily and must cover static portion comprehensively and update the static part with current affairs.

And there are always better responses for every trigger. But the more important thing is how do you showcase yourself in that vibrant situation.  With this disclaimer, I would like to begin my narrative right from the entrance of UPSC campus on the 19th of September 2017,when my reporting time for the interview was scheduled to be at 12.00 Noon .I reached the campus an hour before and was told to wait in an open hall in the other side till the clock struck twelve noon. At the entrance identity check was made with the call letter and a valid ID card. Since I had not taken the e-mail version of my call letter I had to wait for few minutes for the go ahead command while the candidates at my back got in. I walked in ,to the left of Gate 1 towards the building which I was told as the common place for interviews of all kinds of examinations/recruitments being conducted by UPSC.  The entrance door was too heavy for an ordinary person to push and move in. Somehow with all my might I pushed the door back and got inside. The members in the reception hall spoke more Hindi and less English , however they took every effort to communicate themselves clear. At the reception desk I was asked to handover my mobile phone and any other electronic devices I had with me . Though I gave my phone I forgot about my pendrive that I usually have in my purse, but the security woman was clever enough to scan it off. After surrendering all those gadgets I was alloted table number 1 (T 1) meant for a particular board which was not yet disclosed.  Right in the reception there were three round setups with a teefa at the centre surrounded by some 6-7 chairs . The other candidates of my table had already occupied their seats . The girl from Jharkhand who gave me company in the waiting hall sat besides me . She wore salwaar kameez and seemed to be not much bothered about the established custom of wearing a stiff saree (ofcourse I wore a green silk cotten saree). Gentlemen came in suits with neatly tucked in shirts ,blazers on and tie around their necks.  By the time the originals and the required self attested photo copies were collected by a staff member in our table I got my call for the interview with the Alka Sirohi Board though my session was supposed to be after lunch.There were no formal announcements about the composition of the board, however I came to know about the chairperson from the conversation between the security personnel and the staff member who came out to call me. Another one candidate was also sent with me to the first floor where the interview rooms were lined up.  I could not count on my time because I had to leave my watch in my bag though I felt incomplete without it(my fellow candidate who waited patiently for half an hour told me the duration later). For few seconds I sat outside and immediated told to enter the last room in the corridor where the clock was set in for the countdown. I was not as nervous as it is usually described for UPSC interviews and totally forgot the fact that there was a minor spelling mistake in my Online application form. Nevertheless,I felt confident throughout the process.  The Chairperson of my board Smt. Alka Sirohi was the former chairperson of UPSC and a retired IAS officer of Madhya Pradesh Cadre. Though she is not in the list of members of the UPSC she was present in my interview board . Inspite of keeping a grim face she appears to be attentive, showing mixed signals at the same time.  Opening the door to see two lady members facing towards me to my left, guessing the centre seated might be Smt.Alka Sirohi and unaware about the identity of the other lady member, I took permission to get in ,wished them good afternoon(lady members followed by the gentlemen over there) and took my seat after they wished me back and told me to be seated. The panel was seated in a circular arrangement with a male member very close to my left hand. They were enthusiatic in their voice that gave me a good start over.Questions began to flow almost like a rapid fire starting with the Chairperson.  Me: Good Afternoon madam(to the centre and bowed at the other)  Good Afternoon sir (and bowed at the other)  Chairperson(CH-Alka Sirohi maa'm):- Good Afternoon Diana, Please take your seat(with a cheerful voice)  CH:- What are you doing right now diana?  Me:- Maa'm ,Currently I am preparing for the main examination for Civil Services  CH:- What is your Subject?  Me:- In graduation?  CH:- In Civil Services  Me:- Public Administration Maa'm  CH:- (Straight into the Subject)Diana, tell us why do we have so many labour laws?  Me: Maa'm I dont get you properly(She repeats until I acknowledged my understanding of the question. The problem was a bit difference in North and South versions of English Pronunciation, But I never minded to let them repeat till I got the questions right,huh!!)  Me:-Maa'm ,Currently we have some 44 labour laws which are complicated leading to misinterpretation, so we are trying to consolidate it into four labour codes...  CH:-(interrupting) Tell me why do we have so many specific laws ?  Me:-Maa'm About 93% of the total labour force of our country are in the unorganized sector. Inorder to address their welfare in particular we have over a period of time accumulated so many labour laws.  CH:- So what are the four labour codes?  Me:- Maa'm, Social Security then , Can i take a guess? (Now this being a factual question i cannot beat around the bush ,so i decided to take a guess but with permission)  CH:- No , Take a guess? huh ,tell what is there actually  Me:- Sorry maa'm I have not read about it  CH:- Ok,Have you heard of Conditional cash transfer?  Me:-Is it something related to Universal basic Income?( I dont know whether it was appropriate to question back but thats what I did)  CH:-yeeaas..  Me:- Like Universal basic income is about unconditional cash transfer!!!  CH:- So there are so many countries in the world particularly South American that provide conditional cash transfers, Do you think Universal Basic income will work in India because dont you think if we provide money without any conditions people will become lazy?)  Me:- Here her argument was already in the negative, but since the Government favours Universal basic Income and trying to bring it into implementation I did not want to oppose it and decided to give a balanced view)  Maa'm yes, there are limitations but before it is being implemented we cannot come to any such conclusions. For that we could always try it on a pilot basis before making it universal in its coverage  CH:- (No response for my reply) Give me a condition for conditional money transfer  Me:- We can ask them to do something worthwhile with their life( funny silly yes, but that was my instant reply)  CH:- do what?  Me:- Like Employed with something( Yaar, through UBI they are targeting only these kinds of vulnerable people who are unemployed and so on ,so how can we keep it as a condition, I bluffed there)  CH:- We can keep a condition that their children must be sent to school  Me:- Yes maa'm (Ofcourse a good answer if not a good idea I thought within)  Then she relieved herself and signalled the first male member seated immediately to my left to take over)  M1:- (Not in a fluent manner) You said that labour laws are for the unorganized sector when you spoke , what about the organized sector?  Me:- Sir , I meant that they are particularly to address the welfare of the majority that are excluded but it includes organised sector as well  M1: What about the Organization you are trying to join whether it caters to the organized or unorganized?  Me: Sir EPFO is meant for the organized sector  M1: Tell us about the Organization  Me:- Employee Provident Fund Orgainzation is one of the largest social security Organization in the world that facilitates Provident fund, Pension Fund and Insurance Fund.....  M1: (Interrupting , as I poured out spontaneously what I had said to me several times back home)OK, What are the Schemes they are providing?  Me: Employee Provident Fund Scheme 1952, based on the Employee Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, Insurance Scheme 1976  (While answering this I checked on Alka Maa'm and the other lady member, Alka Maa'm nodded but the other lady member looked grumpy , probably because i had forgotten to acknowlegde her as she was sitting on the other side that I had to make a turn around to look at her, but i ignored )  M1: Why do we have an insurance scheme here when we have Life Insurance Corporation of India for Life Insurance  Me:- Sir, both are parallel schemes meant to have a wide coverage  M1:-What is the worth of EPFO  Me:- Sir, I read somewhere that it was about 7.85 lakh crore( But actually I had read from wikipedia that the total assets under management are more than \\u20b98.5 lakh crore as of March 2016, but slipped a bit)  M1: Is there any organised sector industry exempted from the provident fund?  Me:- Those employing less than 20 employees  M1:- No, not about the number but the particular sector  Me:- Sir, IT sector!!  M1:- Any other?  Me:- Sir, when Provident fund was introduced six sectors were covered but i dont remember which one is completely excluded  M1:-When did the act come to force?  Me:-It was enacted in 1952, probably came to force the next year(he look surprised as if I was talking something absurd!!)  (Then the topic changed from Labour issues to general)  M1:- Have you heard of Vishakha Guidelines. What is its status now?  Me:- Its Related to sexual violence simillar to Nirbhaya case  (Alka Maa'm interrupts here to clarify that both the cases are different)  Me:- (I got clarification instantly) Yes maa'm Vishaka guidelines are a result of a supreme court judgement addressing the harassment of women at work place  M1:- What is its status , has it become an act or remain as guidelines  Me:- Sir , It has become an act in 2013  M1:- What is the act called?  Me: Sir, It is Prevention of Sexual harrassment of women at work place Act, 2013  M1:-It covers ,  Me:- All employed women including domestic workers  M1:- who else? Now imagine a situation where you are working in an organisation and your elder sister comes there to visit you and getting harrassed. Will this be addressed by this act  Me:- No Sir, I dont think We have a provision for this case right now  M1:- You have not heard about it?!  Me:- No Sir, I haven't.  (Signalled to M2)  (In the beginning itself I could not catch up with his questions, probably he was seated a bit far from me or wasn't articulate enough to put up the questions in a simpler form or I was dumb atleast)  M2: (asked somthing about Public Administration because that is my optional for Civil Services)  ( I dont remember the first question even now after several repetitions, M1 repeated M2's question even then I dont remember what I replied for that)  M2: You are a Public Administration student, Can you explain what is Delegated Legislation  Me: Sir,Policy making is the domain of the Political executives. Due to the complexity of the law making process certain aspects of it is delegated to the permanent executives to frame laws on it which came to be known as delegated legislation  M2: Is there a check on Administraters ,in Public Sector Undertakings  Me: (I dont know whether I answered for this question yet my reply was)  Yes Sir, even in PSUs we have a board which comprises of the political executives who ultimately have a check on the administration powers( like in EPFO ,rates are fixed by the central board of trustees headed by the labour minister, but I didnot remember that then)  M2: Ok, What are the challenges faced by Public Administration?  Me: As an activity or a discipline?  M2: As an activity  Me: (Forgot how I responded for this)  M2: Tell some of the constitutional provisions related to women and children  Me:- Sir, Articles 23 and 24 talks about the prohibition of children in factories and mines and there is a DPSP article that says equal pay for equal work  M2: (nodded)Any fundamental right for women?  Me: We can tell the right to profession is fundamental to both men and women(blinking expression from me!!!)  (Gives a tricky smile at my general statement)  (Signalled to the next member)  M3(lady member to my front right)  M3:(with all smiles) Diana you seem to have graduated in Engineering but all of a sudden switched over to a social sector job, why is that?  Me:-Maa'm soon after my graduation I tried for Civil Services but I couldnt clear my prelims twice, So I decided to get some groundlevel experience of a social sector project that would be helpful in my future career. Then Rajiv Awas Yojana came my way  M3: What did you do as a field worker?  Me: Maa,m , my job was to collect socio-economic data of slums and assist in GIS mapping of slums.  M3: You dont have any specific experience in the Accounts field. Can you tell us the account structure of the Government of India(She tried hard to convey this query to me).  Me: Maa'm for any amount of money to be withdrawn from the exchequer it requires the approval of the Parliament  M3: What is that fund called?  Me:- Consolidated Fund of India  M3: Good. What are the other funds?  Me:- Contingency Fund of India and Public Accounts of India  M3:- What are the divisions in the Consolidated Fund of India  Me:-I am not able to recollect it now maa'm( Actually I was bit tired by then and did not want to continue with that topic and gave no thought about it literally, but she doesnt seem to move on)  M3: They are called Revenue and Capital Accounts. What is the difference?  Me: Revenue comprises short term and Capital the long term  M3: Is there any limitations? What are in capital account  Me: Like Loans, Grants in aid  (Then she left the topic and caught over with something else)  M3: In the recent days there is some news regarding the revision of the limits for Gratuity  Me: Maa'm I have not read that but they are about to revise the minimum wages limit and bonus limit  (M2 interrupts here and affirms that there was some news about gratuity, but unfortunately that escaped my eyes!!)  M3:So Diana , If you are posted as an Enforcement officer and given with a mandate to link Aadhaar with EPF account, will you compel the people to do so  Me:-Maa'm After this Supreme Court's Observation of Privacy as a Fundamental right ....  M3:(interrupting) No, tell me whether you will force them to link the both as of now(smiles at the other members)  Me:- Maa'm I can persuade people but I dont think that I can compel them to do so  (The Chairperson took over)  CH:-Diana recently Mr. Trump was there in the UN General Assembly meeting. He says that United Nations is failing. What is your opinion about that?  Me:- What? falling?( huh!!)  CH:- Failing ( By this time you would have understood how patient the board was with me, Its my privilege, but the marks who knows haha!!!)  Me:- Maa'm , Can I take few moments to gather my thoughts?  CH:- Sure, you can go ahead  Me:-( I dont know whether I worked on my thoughts but took a deep breath within and replied)  Maa'm when I started my preparation for civil services...  CH:- (interrupts) I am not asking about your preparation..  Me:- Maa'm I am trying to connect..(later I realized its better to hit the bull's eye straight rather than beating around the bush, So I dropped my idea of metaphorizing it and answered straight)  Maa'm United Nations are doing great humanitarian works particularly in the war torn countries of the Middle east but as a political organisation I think it requires certain reforms to include emerging countries like India  CH:- What ?India is already a member  Me:- We have to become permanent Maa'm to get something substantial done  CH:- Permanent member of what  Me:- The UN Security Council  CH:- Yes. How many members it has now?  Me:- 15, 5 permanent  CH:- which are the five permanent members?

Me:- maa'm I dont think so(I understood that Russia is there but again confused about the odd man out- France or Germany , so i decided not to bluff and stick on to my stand)  CH:-How many countries are there in the UN?  Me:- 193 countries maa'm  CH:-How many countries are there in the world?  Me:- Some 200+ maa'm , I am not sure  CH:- Name the countries outside UN  Me:- I dont remember maa'm, may be North korea(I couldnt remember any other odd countries except North Korea)  CH:- North Korea??!!  CH:- Tell me diana, What is the objective of the United Nations?  Me:- Maa'm after the world war II when the league of Nations failed to prevent the wars , a rejuvenated form of it emerged to maintain peace and serenity of the world as United Nations.  CH:- Ok,Thank you Diana  Me:- Thank you maa'm( bowed to others)  By that time it should have been almost one in the afternoon and the male member next to me started sipping his tea."}, {"upvote": 237, "content": "I am assuming you have given the mains exam just concluded and want to prepare for the interview.  1. Go through the Interview test part in CSE Notification : http://www.upsc.gov.in/sites/default/files/Engl_CSP_2017.pdf (page 23 here) 2.  1. Internalize it, spend time on each word appearing there. That will give you a broad overview on what is being expected.  3. Take out your DAF, take each word from it and place it in a different sheet of paper in a notebook / e-notes 4.  1. You need to know inside out of every word appearing in your DAF - for instance birth year - any major events then? the consequences of those?, birth place - famous personality from the place? , is the place in any news currently , school, hobbies etc 2. In case you have filled something you haven't actually done much, for instance lets say hobbies - you filled reading novels there, but actually you have read only a couple here and there. Now is the time! Pick up some books and start reading them! Choose a genre, say fiction, so they ask you about a famous non-fiction novel and you have no clue, you can humbly say you haven't read that genre but you read something else. 3. Know about personalities who are famous in the sport/hobby you pursue. You need not do a PHD on them. But you will be expected to have a curiosity at the least! 4. If you have unusual service preference (IPS over IAS, IRS as 1st) prepare to answer why.  5. After you are done with DAF, tackle current affairs. 6.  1. First make a list of all current affairs topics 2. Have a one liner prepared on them. eg what is GST? you must be able to properly define it in one sentence. 3. Google, discuss, think and note down pros, cons next to the topic, if its a policy decision or the like, or positive negative effects, supporting views, and opposing views. Try having your own mental map about each topics.  (Would like to credit this way of handling CA for interview to my friend Kshitij from NABARD, greatly helped me to become confident about CA :) )  7. Do not say bye bye to your optional yet! Stay in touch and revise at least once! Additional Pointers :  1. Interview is about selling yourself to the board. Making them realize you are the fittest candidate to become part of the Civil Services of our country. So the foremost thing is - know yourself better. 2. Jot down your experiences, lessons learnt be it in hostel, college, work, preparation. Make a SWOT analysis of yourself. Use these while answering questions. 3. Talk to people! As many as you can. Talk to your grandparents/parents/family to know more about your birth place if you haven't lived there. 4. Share DAF with people you know, your friends, family, colleagues, make them ask you questions. 5. Use Quora, reddit, just googling to get more info on things on your DAF, more viewpoints etc 6. Attend 2\\u20133 mocks, not more than that, to get a feel of interview. 7. Speak to everyone professionally, even on whatsapp. For instance instead of typing I am listening to Modi's speach, consciously type I am listening to our Honorable Prime Minister's speech. 8. Read some good books, watch some good movies, stay calm, stay fit. "}, {"upvote": 1841, "content": "I find the best way to effectively prep for an interview is to have answers to the below five questions. Having good answers to these questions will ensure that you have done your research adequately.  1. \\\"Walk me through your resume.\\\"   Have a succinct answer to this (2-3 minutes). You can start with the \\\"headline\\\". e.g., \\\"If you look at my experiences to date, you'll see that I'm very focused on building exciting, user-focused products in a scalable way.\\\"  Make sure your answer has some interesting stories.  2. \\\"Why do you want this job?\\\"   A good way to structure this answer is to answer in two parts. \\\"So first let me talk about why I am passionate about [company] and then I'll explain why I think [role] is an ideal gig to set me up to make a massibecinrricutiom.\\\"  Major point of advice:  Do NOT play too-cool-for-school. be passionate about the company. I've seen a lot of talented friends get dinged by not showing a sincere level of enthusiasm. Why is this so important to get right? First, it's flattering to the interviewer (who already works there). Second, it is absolutely going to be a check mark in the process. It doesn't matter if the company is pursuing you every step of the way, you need the interviewer to like you and most often the person interviewing you won't know all that context.   3. Why should we hire you?   Once again, they won't ask you this, but helps you tell your story. With examples.  One effective structure for an answer goes something like this: \\\"From what I understand about the company and role, it seems you are looking for someone with x, y, z. If you look at my experience and interests, I think you'll find strengths in all three of these areas. For example...\\\"  4. Give me some example of when you have done [exactly the skill they are looking for] in the past.   People are so skewed to wanting someone who has done this before. Like exactly this. It hugely decreases the time you'll need to get up to speed, and decreases the chance that you'll completely suck.  Prepare 2 or 3 interesting stories about when you've demonstrated a similar  project in the past. Make sure they are interesting. People see past success as a huge indicator.  5. How would you go about doing [thing you need to do]?   Eg for a PM: tell me some product ideas? How would you change feature x?) (eg 2 for a Brand Marketer: \\\"how would you write a creative brief?\\\") (eg 3 for BD;: What's the most impactful BD we can do next year? How would you get it done?\\\"     5. Do you have any questions for me?   If you haven't already, get the interviewers background. Have two or three insightful questions about the company, which demonstrate why you are passionate about the place. Then end with one of these \\\"what are you most proud of since you've started working here?\\\", \\\"where do you see this team/company in 5 years\\\", or the best: \\\"how would you describe the ideal candidate for this position?\\\" (if they remotely like you they will describe you.)  The Night Before   Listen to 2-3 videos of the CEO talk about the company. You'll pick up verbiage unique to the company (for example- do they call the people who use their service users? Customers? Riders? Pinners?) which will make you seem like you speak their language. Subtle but powerful.   How to Dress?   Dress comfortable and when in doubt look at the executives on the about me page. Dress like that.    Things to remember (before, after, and during the interview): - Be passionate about the company. This is so important. Resist the urge to be aloof and cool. - Be interested in the interviewer.  - Be positive. - Be honest. (I've often asked candidates for BD: \\\"I noticed you were CEO of [blank], but did you actually do deals?\\\" \\\"Yes, definitely.\\\" \\\"So you drove the deal and signed if?\\\" \\\"Yes.\\\" \\\"What's an indemnity?\\\" \\\"[stunned silence]\\\" - Relax and have fun. - Be thankful for people's time.  - Write thank you notes. I know, I hate those too. Most people don't care, but 1/10 is offended. Not worth it, just write it. That night or %3C23 hours. - Remember that all you can do is give it 100%. If you try as hard as you can and still don't get the offer, that's life."}, {"upvote": 1437, "content": "I've interviewed with some dream companies like Google, Microsoft, Flipkart, LinkedIn. And have cracked all of those. I've worked with all these companies.  Me in Google Mountain View.  Image source: Instagram [ https://www.instagram.com/getlifebytes/ ] [It features more stuff on career-guidance]  The first time I gave an interview, it was pretty bad. I had searched the internet for interview questions related to my role, wrote down answers, revised my notes till the last moment, was anxious days ahead of the interview and had a nervous breakdown right before. Of course, when the interview happened, I couldn't leave an impression on the interviewer. It was not a good job interview. Such bad interviews continued for a long time until I found the secret to having a good job interview.  Here is the secret.  You can do a good job interview by making sure you fit the role. A simple measure to know you fit the role is to ensure you fit the maximum bullet points of the job responsibilities and preferred qualifications of the job.  In the end, you may get the job or not, that is not under your control. A job offer coming to you depends on many circumstances out of your control, but if you showcase your expertise in job responsibilities and preferred qualifications, you'll be a strong candidate and stand a good chance of a good interview.  Let's take a data analyst role that I searched on Linkedin to use here as an example. I found a data analyst position at Flipkart. [1] The job mentions the following job responsibilities and preferred qualifications:  We have two headings here. The first one mentions what you'll do i.e. your job responsibilities. That is the skill of working in a corporation. It includes working in a team, gathering requirements from stakeholders, interpersonal interactions, generating influence and such skills. The second one mentions what you'll need i.e. your preferred qualifications. That is the core technical skill set. It is the knowledge of something without which you won't be able to do your day-to-day tasks. It is non-negotiable. Most job descriptions depict similar two categories. To have a good interview, you have to fit both these categories. Let's start with the second one.  1. Ensure the projects in your resume reflect the core skill set under \\u2018What you'll need.' a. There needs to be a project around optimizing queries in SQL  b. There needs to be one around advanced functions of Excel, possibly macros  c. There needs to be one on databases, schemas and dimensional modeling  d. At least two of these tools need to be highlighted in your summary or projects - R, Python, Power BI, Tableau, Hive  2. Ensure the stories you tell in your interview speak towards the responsibilities under \\u2018What you'll do.' That's how you'll be able to project yourself on the same value prop that the hiring team is looking for.  a. When the interviewer asks you to tell about a project where you gathered user requirements for reports, you tell a story of working on data requests from various stakeholders. b. When the interviewer asks you to tell about a project where you created and maintained reporting tools and applications to support strategic and tactical needs of the company, you tell a story of a project where you handled different data streams and addressed the organization's data requirements.  c. When the interviewer asks you to tell about a project where you designed and developed complex data queries, you tell a story of a project where you tracked key metrics through building and maintaining data pipelines and dashboards. d. And so on.  Once you ensure yourself a fit in these two categories, there are high chances of you having a not-just-good, but a great job interview.

It went on for 30 minutes I suppose. The board had 5 members- two female members and 3 male. It was headed by one of the two female members.  As soon as I entered the interview room they welcomed me with big smile which made me very much comfortable, I could relax. As soon as I sat down my basic details were asked though everything was written on my DAF form . Anyway that's for the candidates benefit itself as it helped me ease up a bit. Following are some of the questions asked :  1. Where did you work previously?  2. What does your previous designation 'trainee decision scientist ' mean?  3. What is big data? How can big data be useful for a country like India?  4. Is working in startup better or in an established industry?  5. What is artificial intelligence?  6. What is reason for you to quit your job and join this service?  7. What are the pros and cons of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana bifurcation?  8. Which genre of books and movies do you watch?

Thus I can say that interview questions are not confined to the topics of social security alone but are more general in nature like that in civil services.  I hope my list of interview questions will give some insights and direction of how to prepare and what kind of questions to be expected.

Here, I can not agree or disagree about my connection with the bureau, as you are not allowed to disclose any of their personal identities.  An ACIO-II is the backbone of the department, who works at the ground level, collects the Intel and reports to the higher authorities. He is equivalent to the Inspector when compared to the uniformed police forces. Though the notification mentions it as a Group-C job, it is a Group-B job(All those employees who are Level-6 and above in the payscale are considered Gr.B employees as per govt. rules). But it is always notified as Gr.C due to a few technical issues which you'll come to know when you join the bureau. This is an all India Job where you can be posted throughout India. You can be posted to any of the border areas, Naxal areas, communally sensitive areas and even comfortable metro postings. It all depends once you complete your training.  You can find about the hierarchy in the Wikipedia page of IB. If you join as an ACIO-II, you can reach upto the level of Joint Deputy Director, equivalent to SSP. But only if you join the post below the age of 25. Those who join after 25 can reach upto the level of Asst. Director.  Nature of job:  Collection of intel at ground level, maintaining liason with sister agencies, performing secret operations if the need arises, regular office work at times etc etc. It is not always a risky job. Less than 50% people would be posted in highly risky areas. The personal threat is comparatively less when you compare it with the uniformed police forces. Except for a few postings, work-life balance is good and you can keep your family with you also. You need not worry about the risk factor. Life threatening risk is very minimal and it depends on the situations where you are operating. Eg. Operating in Kashmir, insurgent prone areas etc. In such areas, every personnel in the police force is prone to equal amounts of risk.  Salary:  After the 7th CPC, the salary has increased drastically for new ACIO recruits. You would get approximately 63k in hand during training, which only includes your Basic, DA, SSA(Special security allowance which is 20% of DA). You would get all the other allowances like HRA etc..once you complete your training. Gross salary after training, for plain postings-76K and for hard postings-90K which includes Hardship allowance, ration money etc. Standard deductions applicable from this gross salary. Please note that you won't be getting any extra income and if you take bribe and if it comes to the notice of seniors, strict action would be taken against you as the department doesn't tolerate corruption.  Job satisfaction:  It all depends on your place of your posting, which is randomly based on your luck. No recommendations/political pressures work in the department. If you compare it with a software job, this would give you immense satisfaction, but if you compare it with higher positions like IAS, IPS you won't be satisfied. The work pressure is not that much because of the fact that pressure can't help in any intel gathering. So, I can assure you the peace of mind for sure. But if you are posted in big cities like state capitals etc.. you have hectic work. This is not a James bond type job which you might have read in many blogs, answers etc.  Pros of this job:  1. Good paying job. You won't be making this much money in any of the SSC CGL jobs except AAO. 2. Work is not monotonous. You will start feeling interested in your job if you get some good work oppurtunities. 3. Prestige in the society because of the department's name and integrity. 4. You'll feel that you are serving the nation atleast at some point of time. 5. Good backup to those who want to prepare for other exams like UPSC CSE. You would get good amount of time to study but it all depends on your place of posting like I mentioned above. Cons of this job:  1. No absolute power for the post. You have to do things from behind the curtains. Those who want recognition and showoff, this is not a place for you. 2. All India postings, Some one from Tamil Nadu may be posted in Kashmir, those from Rajasthan may be posted in Mizoram etc. But this is only restricted for your initial posting. Once you finish your initial posting term which is 3 years, you can comeback to your home state or neighboring states based on the vacancies at that time. 3. I have seen extremities of people who had joined this job. Few of them are very happy and few of them are highly depressed about the job. It all depends on the place and the work you are doing. So, finally I can just say that, this job has both pros and cons. If you are frustrated about getting a govt job or want to keep this as a backup option for other exams like UPSC CSE, then you can put in some hard work and clear this exam. Clearing this exam would take immense hard work because of the number of candidates appearing in the exam. The interviews would be taken by IPS officers who are equivalent to the rank of IG's so be thoroughly prepared for it. If there are any queries, which you need about the job(Not the silly ones), then you may please comment, I'll try to edit the answer and answer your questions. Exam related questions like books, what to study etc. you may refer to so many blogs which are available in the internet.  Thanks for reading. !  Jai Hind.  Edit 1: Many of them are asking about the word temporary and if this job is temporary or permanent?  Ans. Every central govt. job comes up with the same terminology. There is a probation period of 2 years, post which your post gets confirmed. The job is permanent since day 1 of your service. Even jobs like IAS,IPS are temporary till you finish your probation period. If you want to leave the service before the probation period, you need to pay 3 months salary(Only basic+DA which amounts to almost 1.5\\u20131.7 lakhs) as bond money. You need not pay any amount if you get selected in any of the posts in state/central government if the grade pay of the new job is higher than the present job. If the new job has lower grade pay or if you want to move out from govt. you need to pay the bond amount.  Regarding disclosing about the job to friends/family:  Yes, you shouldn't disclose your identity to outsiders. However, you can tell about your job and place of posting to your close friends and family members. But you should not reveal any details about the details of the work/tasks that you are doing currently to any of the outsiders including your family.  Regarding work life and family:  Yes, there is enough work life balance in the job. You wont' be having hectic job like Software or any other central departments. But it all depends on the situation. Sometimes you can be busy 24x7 and sometimes you may not have work for 2\\u20133 days. But you should be ready to work at any point of day if a call from a superior officer comes and if the need arises. You can keep your family with you in 90% of the places. In the initial 3 years, you may get hardpostings depending on the state in which you are posted, where it might be difficult to keep your family with you, (Eg. J&K, Chattisgarh etc.) but later you can be in normal places. If you are posted in peaceful state, you can keep your family from Day 1. I have written that I have seen extremities because, few of them are happy with metro postings, few of them are depressed over their border postings even though all of them are in the same department.  Regarding UPSC preparation and spending in home state:  Yes, you will get the time to study. But again it all depends on the place of posting and how hectic your work is. But you can manage studies easily. There are so many people who have cleared CSE and other exams while working here.  Home state posting: It all depends on your initial posting. If you are posted in tough states like J&K and NE, you can get home posting after 3 years. Others may get home posting after 5\\u20136 years of service and after first tenure of 3 years, you'll get neighbouring states easily if you are posted in peaceful state before.  Regarding interview and medical:  Medical examination will be of normal standards. It would not be tough like SSB. Interviews would be taken by Senior IPS officers of ranks IG and above. So you can expect it on the standards less than CAPF AC, CSE but more than normal interviews. It all depends on the officers and it would be more on the lines of CSE interview. Prepare thoroughly and have your opinions on events happening around you around 6 months before interview.  Thank you!"}, {"upvote": 25, "content": "Keep in mind that a college admissions interview is very different from most job interviews (or even a graduate admissions interview). The interviewers are school alumni (i.e., non-professional interviewers) and mostly just want to have a fairly casual conversation about you, about them, and about their alma mater. I'm not sure there's really a way to \\\"ace\\\" a college admissions  interview insofar as the format and types of questions asked can be rather varied. But there are better and worse ways to approach it.  Most importantly, try to be genuine. Relax.  Definitely come prepared to talk about some of the items on your resume (e.g., what you learned from and enjoyed about each experience) since there's a not a bad chance you'll be asked, but don't program yourself just to regurgitate items off of your resume. Not only will you appear like a (possibly gloating) robot, your interviewer might be a bit irked at hearing you spit off a bunch of information that they might already have known any way (some do ask for your resume ahead of time if they aren't already given your profile by the admissions office), and you might miss the opportunity to take the conversation in a direction that would have uncovered some commonality between you and interviewer or an interesting topic. The interview is a time for you to shine beyond what's on your resume and transcript.  Think about a couple of questions that you might want to ask the interviewer about the school or about college life in general. They don't have to be particularly deep, but they should be questions that you can't find by browsing the school's admissions website in fifteen minutes.  Relax if a curveball comes your way, and if you don't end up hitting it, don't sweat it (if anything, relaxing will maximize your chance of connecting on the swing). I've heard horror stories about interviewers asking technical questions or (God forbid) even giving interviewees papers to read. Such cases are extremely far and few in between, and even if something similar were to happen, the admissions office probably already has a record of said events happening to other interviewers. The worst-case scenario is that the admissions office simply ignores your interviewer's write-up, which actually happens to more people than schools want to admit (occasionally they keep on crazy alumni interviewers for political reasons). \\\"Student X couldn't parse a scientific paper I authored last year\\\" isn't exactly all that negative. You are a high school student, after all!  I was asked in the middle of my Princeton interview a question that was asked when my interviewer did some form of knowledge bowl in high school (he noticed I had done quiz bowl in middle and high school). While not an obscure question by any means, I suspect if I had not answered correctly, the interview would have gone south from there. Interviewers don't really have an agenda per se, but clicking with them certainly makes the entire atmosphere of the conversation better, as they are people.  Don't take the interview too seriously. It probably went better than you thought it did, and frankly, the interview is probably one of the least important (but still important) components of the college application process. For the most part, colleges just want to make sure that you're a sane person and confirm that you were the person you wrote about in your application. Occasionally, if you really click with an experienced interviewer, glitter and sparkles might result, but don't really expect that to happen. Conversely, if you don't mind your manners, you could really derail your chances if you deeply offend your interviewer or something like that.  Take the interview as an opportunity to learn more about the schools themselves. You'll be confronted with a difficult choice to make in April and May, and an interview, while brief, gives you a sense of how the school's alumni think about the world and some colorful stories about their college experiences. One interviewer told me about Solzhenitsyn's speech at his college commencement; another talked about the crazy overnighters he pulled in college. As a byproduct, the interviewer might just catch on that you actually have some interest in the school (and aren't, say, just applying to a dozen schools so you can get into at least one).  Lastly, just relax."}, {"upvote": 23, "content": "QUESTION : How can girls get into IB or RAW?  ANSWER : I would recommend you to appear for the civil services examination and opt for the IPS (Indian Police Service), if you are aspiring to reach the top position in the IB (Intelligence Bureau) or the RAW (Research and Analysis Wing)  There are other exams like Assistant Central Intelligence Officer exam that the ministry of Home affairs conduct to recruit personnel for their department. However, all these recruits are Group C officers and they would probably never be able to head the organisation like the way IPS officers do in most cases.  IPS officers are Group A officers and their promotion and perks and excellent.  If you want to work in the technical wing of the RAW, then you must look out for the advertisements released by the cabinet secretariat for the same.  I have noticed an advertisement released by the cabinet secretariat in 2016 and 2017 inviting application from engineering graduates (electronics and computer science) and science graduates (physics and chemistry) for the posts of Senior Research Officer and Senior Field Officer. The criteria that they were looking in students is to have a valid GATE (Graduate Aptitute Test in Engineering) score in their respective subjects.  If you are looking to be an agent in RAW, then don't expect them to publish any recruitment advertisement in newspapers because RAW is a classified organisation and they recruit personnel from other services like (Indian defence forces and central police forces) either on deputation or permanently absorbing them into their cadre as per the central staffing scheme.  There is a great demand for people who are having excellent proficiency in languages like (Mandarin, Urdu, Spanish, Russian, Arabic) in RAW as their operations are mainly focused on China, Pakistan, Central Asia and Middle East Countries. If you are proficient in any of these Five languages and happen to be in the Indian defence forces or in the central police forces, then there is every possibility for your application to be accepted by the RAW."}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/Which-DSLR-is-better-Canon-EOS-1100D-or-Canon-EOS-1200D", "question": "Which DSLR is better Canon EOS 1100D or Canon EOS 1200D", "answers": [{"upvote": 12, "content": "Short Answer: 1100D  Long answer: I already own a 1100D and i am quite happy with the performance. And if you closely look the comparison [Compare the Canon EOS 1100D vs the Canon EOS 1200D [ http://snapsort.com/compare/Canon-1100D-vs-Canon-EOS-1200D ] ] you will see that 1200 is actually the replacement of 1100. There is no major upgrade other than video size[1080 vs 720],autofocus and  megapixel boost. I am assuming that you are an enthusiast and trying DSLRs for the first time, it is very unlikely that you are interested in FULL HD videos or recording videos in the first place using this DSLR. [I avoid videos with DSLR because of the video size which is too high and I cannot record more than 10-20 mins of footage on the base memory card]  Same goes for the images.  An 18MP image will be at-least 24 MB RAW and 8-10 MB JPEG whereas if would be around 18 MB and 5-8 MB respectively for a 12 MP image which is more than enough for high resolution wallpapers, or printing 5\\\" x 7\\\" photos.  Thats why would suggest for the cheaper 1100D and use the saved amount in buying extra lenses [especially 50 mm prime or a Zoom lens] depending on your interest [portraits/birds/wildlife vs landscapes]. Hope this helps!!"}, {"upvote": 6, "content": "Consider the following points:  Canon has finally moved ahead from the cheap plastic body seen on the  1100D to a metal body with the 1200D. Canon has completely covered the  right hand side which has the palm grip, with textured rubber which is  neatly complemented by a rubberised thumb-rest area on the rear side.  This was missing on the EOS 1100D which give the EOS 1200D an edge over  the older model. Then, the screen size is now 3inches compared to the 2.7 inch screen on 1100D. Higher MP count from 12 MP to 18 MP which means larger images and bigger files.  Apart from the above points there is nothing new offered in the camera espcially in the focus system, optics etc which are far more important points to consider rather than the outside body.  Further with the price factor brought in, it should rather be easy to decide on 1100D unless otherwise one primarily wants to shoot videos in 1080P."}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "I will suggest you to go with Canon DSLR  EOS 1200D is better than Canon EOS 1100D, because of its user- friendly features and creative filters."}, {"upvote": 18, "content": "Nikon, Canon, Sony or any other brand will produce good photographs. Here my personal advice is to buy the Same brand you started with as you are familiar with that brand."}, {"upvote": 123, "content": "It's the paper or plastic, Coke or Pepsi for photographers\\u2014Canon, or Nikon? While one photographer will swear by his Canon, another will insist her Nikon is the better option. So which camera is best? That's a matter of opinion\\u2014but that doesn't mean the individual camera brands don't have characteristics that may make them more suited to one type of photography or one type of photographer over the other.  When comparing Canon vs. Nikon side-by-side, there are a lot of similarities, like solid image quality and a wide range of accessories, but there's a lot of differences too\\u2014some subtle, others, not so much.  Canon Vs. Nikon: Sensors  Both Canon and Nikon offer cameras powered by similarly sized sensors, but there's a lot more that goes into image quality than just the size of the sensor. Just when one manufacturer seems to leap forward in sensor technology, the other catches up.  Most of Nikon's latest DSLRs use a new sensor design that allows them to eliminate the optical low pass filter without an abundance of moir\\u00e9, or distortion in fine lines and patterns. The filter is one more thing for the light to pass through before hitting the sensor, so eliminating it allows the camera to pick up more details and perform a bit better in low light. All of Nikon's 2015 APS-C sensor cameras don't use an optical low pass filter and a handful of their full frame professional models have eliminated it as well.  Canon's latest DSLRs, on the other hand, seem more focused on the megapixels. Most of Canon's DSLRs still use an optical low pass filter, though there are options like the Canon EOS 5DS R that do without. Their latest big announcements come in the form of full frame DSLRs with a whopping 50 megapixels. While judging a camera on megapixels alone is like judging a book by its cover, the EOS 5DS does capture a 8688 x 5792 resolution, where the Nikon D810 with 36 megapixels captures at most 7360 x 4912. The higher resolution allows for larger prints and more cropping without affecting the image quality.  While the two are focusing on different areas of sensor technology, Canon and Nikon DSLRs both have excellent image quality. That doesn't mean you'll get the exact same image when shot with two different cameras, though. Colors between the two options can be noticeably different, for example. Which one produces better color is a matter of personal preference\\u2014they are simply different, there's no right or wrong answer.  Canon Vs. Nikon: Speed  Canon and Nikon come in pretty even as far as the speed of their autofocus, but there's a subtle difference in their burst speed rates. Speed is hard to come by in DSLRs\\u2014where it's not uncommon to find a mirror-less camera with a 10 fps burst mode, DSLRs have more gear to move to take a picture and it's tougher to reach those high speeds.  Canon tends to have faster high-end DSLRs. The Canon EOS 7D Mark II ($1,799) hits an excellent 10 fps burst rate, making it one of the top DSLRs for sports shooters. Nikon's fastest APS-C camera, on the other hand, is capable of 6 fps, the D7200 ($1,199). Getting even further into the advanced options, Canon's full frame 1D X hits 14 fps, where the similar Nikon D4S gets 11 fps.  When it comes to the entry-level, more budget friendly models, however, Nikon offers more speed. It's usually just by a frame or two though, as when comparing the Nikon D7200's 6-7 fps to the Canon T6S's 5 fps.  Canon Vs. Nikon: Operation  Performance between the two brands is pretty similar, but there are some noticeable differences when it comes to operating each camera. The terminology on a Canon is different from that on a Nikon, for starters. The S on the Nikon's mode dial and the Tv on the Canon both indicate shutter priority mode, for example. Nikon also uses simpler terminology for autofocus modes\\u2014it's a bit simpler to remember what Continuous Autofocus is versus Al Servo Autofocus (they're both the same thing).  There's also often a significant difference in battery life, with Nikons generally able to take more shots on a single charge. For example, the Nikon D7200 has double the battery life of the similarly priced Canon T6S. That's not the case with every model, but, more often than not, Nikons have a better battery rating.  Canon Vs. Nikon: Video Quality  Canon, traditionally, has offered better video quality sooner. They were the first to develop a hybrid autofocus system allowing the camera to refocus while recording. Canon is known for their better autofocus tracking while recording, and they also have a selection of lenses designed specifically for video.  Answering which brand has the better video quality two years ago would have been much simpler. Where a few models ago Nikon didn't offer autofocus while recording video, their latest DSLRs offer continuous autofocus. Comparing models individually across the brands, Nikon even has some cameras with a 60 fps frame rate for smoother motion where the equivalent Canon has 30 fps. Canon traditionally offers the better video, but Nikon's latest developments put them much closer.  Canon Vs. Nikon: Options  When it comes to the more advanced DSLRs, there's pretty much a Canon to match every Nikon. That's not always the case though. Nikon hasn't yet come up with an answer to Canon's speedy 10 fps EOS 7D Mark II, and Nikon has a camera designed specifically for astrophotography, the D810A, where Canon's similar option has a smaller APS-C sensor.  When it comes to entry-level options, however, Canon's selection doesn't quite match up with Nikon's models. There are older Canon DSLRs available for around $500, but the current models (as listed on Canon's website) start at $899 for the body only for the EOS 60D. Nikon's D3300 offers full DSLR capability to beginners for a $650 list price\\u2014and that includes a kit lens. Canon offers a model priced fairly evenly with the enthusiast Nikon D7200, the T6S, but there are some pretty significant differences. The D7200 has no optical low pass filter, 51 autofocus points, 60 fps HD video, 6-7 fps burst shooting and an 1,100 shot battery life. The T6S, by comparison, has an optical low pass filter, 19 focus points, 30 fps HD video, 5 fps burst shots and half the battery life. Where the specs are close in the high-end models, Nikon often offers more in their entry and enthusiast options (though again, that's not always the case).  Canon Vs. Nikon: So which one is best?  Buying a DSLR is a bit different than buying a compact camera, because once you start accumulating lenses, it becomes much more expensive to change brands. Since the two brands operate a little differently (and with different terminology), switching would also mean relearning a few minor things.  So, then, which manufacturer is best? Which camera brand should you choose?  The answer? There isn't a winner\\u2014both Canon and Nikon offer excellent cameras with solid image quality. If one brand offered a better camera every time, the other would've gone out of business a long time ago.  But, that's not to say one brand isn't more suited to one person or the other. Beginners would likely be happy with a DSLR from either system\\u2014but Nikon offers a more affordable option that's still full of features and Nikon's terminology is a bit easier to understand when starting from scratch. Sports photographers can capture the action with a DSLR from either manufacturer\\u2014but Canon tends to offer more speed in their high end models. Quality videos can be shot on both\\u2014but Canon typically has a smoother autofocus and offers lenses specifically for cinema.  When choosing between camera brands, it's best to compare each camera individually\\u2014where Nikon may have a better entry-level DSLR, Canon may have a better DSLR for sports.  When making the choice between Canon vs. Nikon, here are a few things to consider:   * What is the most important thing in a camera to you? Speed? Resolution? Video quality?  * What does the manufacturer offer at your current experience level and for your current budget?  * What does the manufacturer offer that you might be looking to upgrade to in the future? While you probably won't be looking at the same options in five years, if they offer something in that range currently, they're likely to continue to making updates to that line.  * What lenses would you ideally like to add to your kit? Does that manufacturer offer those lenses? Canon or Nikon? Neither one is a bad choice, which means it's not an easy choice."}, {"upvote": 8, "content": "One of these photos was taken with a brand new 5D mark IV.

You can also mount and use a large number of 3rd party lenses for the Canon EF system, from companies like Sigma / Tokina / Tamron / Samyang etc"}, {"upvote": 4, "content": "The Canon EOS 1200D (T5 in the USA) is a fully functional, low-end Digital SLR. It features an APS-C sized sensor (1.6x magnification factor versus full frame DSLRs), it shoots 18Mpixel still images, shoots burst shots at 3.0 fps, up to approximately 69 JPEGs or approximately 6 raw file before slowing down to write to the SD/SDHC/SDXC/EyeFi card. It handles video at 1920x1080-24/25/30p or 1200x720-50/60p, encoded in IP long-GOP AVC at 44Mb/s. It's got 9-point autofocus with one cross-type sensor in the center, sensitivity to 0EV in the center and 1EV on the other points. And a 63 point auto exposure system with metering to 1EV.  Shutter speeds to 1/4000th second, down to 30seconds. Back panel display is 460K dot resolution. You get about 500 shots through the viewfinder, no flash. Shoots raw or JPEG or both, offers the usual P/A/S/M pro modes as well as a bunch of consumer oriented shooting modes I never use so won't really compare here.   So it's got all the check-marks for a regular DSLR. So what's missing or limited? Here's some:    * Pentamirror. Cheaper DSLRs have a pentamirror rather than a pentaprism in the viewfinder -- that's the bit of optics that inverts the lens image to deliver a right-side-up view for your eye. A pentamirror is a bit dimmer.   * No microphone input. If you're really interested in video, you're not using your on-camera audio for anything but synchronization. But some people get better-than-nothing results using an external mic. When I shoot video with my EOS 6D, I feed the audio output from my Tascam DR-60D recorder into the 6D to ensure a better sync track. But I would still get a good sync with the camera's internal mono audio in most case.   * Some cameras have faster shutter speeds and other operations. My 6D is also limited to 1/4000th, but it shoots 4.5fps. My Olympus OM-D mirrorless shoots up to 10fps, 1/8000th shutter speed with mechanical shutter, 1/16000th electronics. Those are occasionally useful things, but back in the film days, I had 3fps and 1/4000th second, max.   * Both of my cameras shoot better video, offering AVC-Intra modes that shoot with less compression at higher bitrates. Some cameras these days also offer 1920x1080/60p video. Most of these are issues for fast motion, so if you're planning to shoot nothing but sports, maybe this is not your camera.   * My 6D also has 9 AF sensors and a cross in the center... not a problem for me. It's sensitive down to -3EV, though, which means better performance when it's very dark. But it's a much more expensive camera. Some other Canons have way more AF points and more cross type sensors, which lets you get into focus tracking and other things that are also well suited to sports, maybe nature, but aren't deal breakers.   * My OM-D has IBIS (In Body Image Stabilization), which lets is stabilize the shot for any lens. It's pretty amazing. On the 6D, like the 1200D, image stabilization is a function of the lens.   * Wifi. Both of my cameras have built-in Wifi, the 1200D does not. Is that useful? For me, pretty rarely. I do have remote trigger apps which let me fire the cameras from my smartphone, that's pretty much the main point of it. I can also transfer images, subject to limitations, but I don't really use that feature. If that's important to you, you can use an EyeFi card or look at a different model.   * Articulated screen. The 1200D screen is fixed. So is the 6D screen... Canon's pretty much only put articulated screens on mid-range cameras. My OM-D has an articulated screen, which is handy for overhead shots, selfies if you must, but most of the time it's main value is that it lets me fold the screen around against the camera body, to save power and avoid scratches. I like viewfinders.   * Battery life. The 1200D uses Canon's consumer model battery, so your 500 shot life is about half of what I get with the 6D. But better than most mirrorless. The OM-D gets about 310 shots based on the CIPA rating unless I tweak the settings to aggressive switch things off. Naturally, as a DSLR, you're draining the battery just to look through the viewfinder.   * No touchscreen... not really much of an issue. Consumer P&S cameras do have touchscreens because they lack controls. The 1200D has a pretty regular Canon button layout -- if you know one Canon, you can pretty much figure out any other.  Even more recent DSLRs and mirrorless with touchscreens don't often do much with them.  "}, {"upvote": 4, "content": "I own a 5D mark IV and am perfectly satisfied with it.

Honestly, my 11 year old 50D and 10 year old 7D do 95% of what I need from a camera. I still use them both regularly; it's much easier to switch bodies than change lenses. My main reason for upgrading to the 5D mk IV was that I needed a higher ISO occasionally.  Can you tell which of these photos was taken with the 7D and which was taken with the 5D mark IV?

I get the feeling you have not shot weddings either. So I am going to answer this a bit different. Sorry, but it will be a little long. But hopefully it will help you more than just listing a camera body.  The first thing when you shoot a wedding is you need to ALWAYS have backups of all your equipment! This is vital. So you never want to shoot a wedding with just one camera body. What do you do if it dies part way through the wedding? A side point is make sure you get liability insurance too. Again, if something goes wrong and you don't get the pictures of the once in a lifetime event you can count on being majorly sued!  So you need to get at least two camera bodies! Next you need some professional lenses. What I did (I don't do weddings any more) is get a strap that handles two bodies and then have different focal lengths on each body. That way I can easily switch back and forth. You might do a 24\\u201370mm f/2.8 on one and then the 70\\u2013200mm f/2.8 on the other. Or you might do a 50mm f/1.8 on one and a 24\\u201370mm on the other. Tamron now has a 35\\u2013150mm f/2\\u20132.8 that sounds like it is an amazing lens. And it is a really sweet focal length. This also gives you at least two lenses so you have a backup. And the 50mm f/18 is a very inexpensive lens to always have around, and looks great.  Here is the interesting thing of camera choice compared to lens choice. A good camera, even DX body, with a great lens will get great shots. But a great camera body with an average lens will get just average photos. It is garbage in garbage out. Your image sensor can only capture what the lens sends it. So you are way better to go very inexpensive on the body and then spend the money on amazing lenses. This will help you with your budget to have multiple camera bodies too.  You will probably want some flash lighting if your going to be inside or at night. And you will need to have backups of lights. Also, get to know the lights well.  Bottom line is plan the budget for minimum of two cameras, two really good lenses, and lights, and extras of memory cards and batteries. You are way better to get two DX sensor bodies with really nice lenses so you have backups, and maybe a good BlackRapid strap to hold both cameras at the same time. You can always upgrade bodies later after you have the business to justify it. And I would get two of the exact same body. This way all the buttons and functionality are the same on both of them. You don't wanna miss shots."}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "Why not both?  What truly matters is the skill and experience of the photographer, the choice of venue and lighting, and cooperation of everyone involved with the wedding.  If you're hiring someone to do your wedding photos, pay attention to their portfolio. Do the folks in the photo look relaxed and happy? Is their good coverage of people at the event? Do the photos evoke a feeling of time, place, joy, and remembrance? Those are the things you will prize in future years, not whether it was shot at 24MP or 50MP. If possible get references, and ask what you can do to assure the best results and still keep the day special. If you do want to ask about their technique, ask about lighting, location, and organization.  On the other hand, if you're interested in doing wedding photography, then you are starting with the wrong question. Go and observer an experienced professional wedding photography, or look through the galleries of the best in the business. See what they do in handling people, how to organize comfortable and relaxed poses, how they choose their locations and lighting, and attention to the smallest detail in the formal poses. Those are the marks of a true professional, not the fine details of their equipment choices.  When you do gear up for professional wedding work, be sure you pay attention to the need for backup cameras and possibly a second shooter, the value of having an assistant to wrangle people, of lighting and lenses, with an eye on end-to-end workflow. It's about a lot more than the choice of camera body.  Now having said all that, personally I'd go with both the R3 and R5. The R3 actually lighter compared to the R5 with battery grip. The R3 also distributes heat better, which is good for extended video work. Having both means you have backup and outfit a second shooter, and you have a lighter unit for candid shots."}, {"upvote": 6, "content": "Either one will do fine, but the 50MP picture size of the R5 will slow down your workflow.

The EOS R3 can do everything the EOS R5 can do, except for resolution (and smaller size if you use the EOS R5 without a battery grip).  Depending on how you shoot, 24MP is plenty of resolution. I know many wedding photographers who shoot with the Canon EOS R6 which is only 20MP.  Ultimately, better is subjective. Are the 45MP files of the EOS R5 taking up too much space, and you'd rather have 24MP files? Is the EOS R5 auto focus not good enough for you, and you want the improvements of the EOS R3? Or do you simply need the more rugged body of the EOS R3? Do you shoot video and want to be rid of Canon's ridiculous 30-minute record limit?

I'll been needing to live with it for a good year :-)  I'm actually really happy to see the Canon EOS R5. I left Canon back in 2018, mostly because I was getting more out of my Olympus gear. I grokked the whole mirrorless thing, found it better than optical. I could actually use my old manual lenses much more effectively than on an DSLR.  But part of it was their basic attitude. Kasey Stern, the genius behind the Camera Conspiracies vlog, pretty much expressed my main problem with Canon. It was absolutely clear, over the years, that Canon was arbitrarily holding back the level of technology on lower-end cameras to sell higher-end cameras\\u2026 regardless of the actual cost of those features. If you're the only camera company in the world and doing that, maybe that's okay. But they were not\\u2026. there are other camera companies.  So in 2015, I had bought a few Olympus Micro Four Thirds cameras, which I was using as a secondary system\\u2026 for when I didn't want to drag along my 10kg+ Canon system. I bought the OM-D E-M5 Mark II that year. First thing to note was that, even thought this was a mid-range camera, they didn't reduce features in any way that wasn't an obvious additional expense. In fact, they introduced a bunch of new features on this model that the flagship OM-D E-M1 didn't do. A year later, they introduced a new flagship, the OM-D E-M1 Mark II, with a bunch of new features. Not long after, they put out an update that added some of those new features \\u2014 those that would reasonably work \\u2014 for my E-M5 Mark II.   Canon, on the other hand, intentionally crippled their lower-end models to drive higher-end sales. And perhaps, in a different way, they also kind of decided, for the photographer, various limits of the camera that were not necessarily natural. Their old behavior was to cripple a bunch of things. So I had a Canon 60D and added a 6D. The 60D, a much lower cost camera, had a far, far better autofocus system. They could have put something at least that good into the 6D for very little extra money, but they were more concerned about the 6D/5D competition than Nikon or anyone else competing with their offerings.  This was all through the camera, including a bunch of things that were 100% software-bases, just there to crapify the 6D versus the 5D. When you're invested in any system \\u2014 camera or otherwise \\u2014 you have a vested interest. And if you're an internet writer or pundit, your first impulse is to support and defend the things your excellent brain has found to be the best. Unfortunately, as a full-time engineer and only hobby photographer, it was all too easy for me to see how that cripple hammer had been applied. And once you get involved with a company that doesn't do that, even a little bit; a company that's actually adding new high-end features to your mid-range camera, you have a hard time sticking with the old guys.  So I was really excited to see the EOS R5. Of course, since I have not used this camera, I had to give you all my ideas here rather than a real review. But also, I'm hoping this goes beyond the R5 and changes the way Canon is thinking. I knew Canon had some technology issues\\u2026 here, they've solved that a bit, but they're also leaving it up to the user how they'd like to deal with camera limitations. As a result, you have limited features not offered by anyone else.   I noticed back in 2018 how Canon was going about their EOS R business. They introduced the original EOS R as a low-cost mirrorless, relative to the EOS 5D Mark IV, that had the same sensor and, ideally, same image quality. But they crippled it a bit, to ensure it wasn't quite a pro-grade match to the 5D. And yet, that also made it cheaper.  So get inside Canon's head for a moment. The EOS R was not all that well received, but I got the idea right away. Sony was drinking Canon's milkshake as photographers and videographers started to really get the idea of mirrorless camera advantages. When they introduced the R, they introduced three different EF to RF adapters. So any old Canon shooter could buy an EOS R, a lens adapter, and pretty much pretend they had a mirrorless Canon EF camera. The key here: you could buy a Sony, buy a Metabones adapter, but you still have a Sony\\u2026 it doesn't work as fast with your EF lenses, it doesn't use your batteries, it doesn't use your speedlights. So Canon was wise: the EOS R's only purpose was to stop the bleeding.  Next thing was glass. The reason Canon and Nikon had 80\\u201390% of the pro SLR and DSLR market for 50 years was that they had huge collections of lenses. As nice as a new camera might be, if you can't get the lens you need, fuggetaboudit! And yet, Canon offered those three adapters\\u2026. no worries.  No worries unless, like Canon, you're trying to launch a new system. Nikon went there\\u2026 Nikon didn't do all that well with the Z system, despite making excellent gear. My contention was simple: you can't make a new system for new users if you're Canon or Nikon. As with the EOS R, you make a camera that's kind of a no-brainer for existing users.  But here's the thing: let's assume I still have my EOS 6D. I go and buy an EOS R, I buy the basic adapter, and I'm golden, right\\u2026 I have a mirrorless Canon EF camera. I'm good, but Canon isn't\\u2026 they'd rather me be an EOS EF user than a Sony user, but what they'd really like is for me to be an EOS R user, cemented in place. That only happens if my next lens buys are RF lenses, not EF lenses, despite the fact they can't work on my other cameras.  So Canon did another cool thing: rather than try to flesh out their RF lens line with the basic set of EF clones they'd need to sell EOS R system cameras, they made hero lenses. The first RF lenses were insanely good lenses. So were the next few. This was brilliant \\u2014 anyone buying that one EOS R body was potentially sucked in for those lenses. This was absolutely an unusual move: Canon was delivering lenses that average folks couldn't afford, but they were selling dreams to their professional user base.   So even without having an R5 in my hands, I know enough about it to know that this completes the circle. This is the pro body that everyone who flirted with EOS R \\u2014 pretty much all pros and well-heeled enthusiasts \\u2014 wanted. And more.  Canon launched the video on a DSLR thing with the Canon 5D Mark II. Okay, sure, Nikon got there a few months before with 720; video, but Canon really sold it. And I think a big part of that, early on, as Vincent Laforet's 5D Mark II short film Reverie\\u2026 anyone who used digital camera for video back then simply knew this film was impossible. But after the 5D Mark II \\u2014 half of which were sold for video use \\u2014 Canon lost steam in the DSLR-for-video market. Why? Well, heck, Canon has been one of the Big Four in camcorders\\u2026 so they built Cinema EOS, a line of much more expensive cinema cameras that used regular EF lenses. And so regular EOS product line cameras had to get the cripple hammer.. you wouldn't want someone buying a $750, $1500, or $3000 camera that fits their needs if maybe you can sell 10% of those buyers on a $10,000+ camera that does it all\\u2026. at least, that seemed to be the logic.   So now the R5 is kind of a return to the 5D Mark II\\u2026 no artificial limitations, far as I can tell. And even IBIS \\u2014 Canon's the last one to the party on that, and I'm a bit skeptical that they can match Olympus on their first try, but I've found it critical for my own shooting.

They're high pressure jobs where nothing can go.  That being said, which lens you need/what lens is good depends on your style.  I use 2 cameras, one with a Canon 24\\u201370mm f/2.8L, and one with a Canon 70\\u2013200mm f/2.8L w/ IS.  The 24\\u201370 is a great portrait lens because of its relatively wide angle, so I can easily fit entire groups of people on there, while not having the wide angle distortion wider lenses have.  My 70\\u2013200 is probably the best lens I've ever bought. Thanks to the high zoom and low aperture it takes gorgeous close ups, while also allowing me to take great wides from further away, giving me beautiful depth of field and lens compression.  I'd say you should really shoot with 2 cameras, with one wide and one long lens, if you want to work professionally. Otherwise, or if you're just getting started, I'd suggest going for something that has some zoom, but still has a wide aperture.  Alternatively, I've seen a photographer do a wedding with only a 50mm prime and an 80mm prime. This is a lot cheaper but you'll have to do more effort to get the shots you want.  Lastly, no, I would not reccomend getting such a wide lens. I own that 10\\u201318mm, (got it with my first camera a few years back), and it's great for big crowds and architecture in good light, but not for capturing intimate moments. You'd have to get right up in their faces and there would be a lot of distortion and not much depth of field.  Wedding also have night parties, during which that lens with its 4.5 aperture will be completely useless unless you're using a strong flash (which will look ugly!)  That was a lot of rambling, but I hope it helped!"}, {"upvote": 4, "content": "It is undoubtedly an exciting product because of what Canon has claimed. Two most exciting things are:  Pro's:  1. IBIS. 2. 8K video Full Frame! (Exciting)! 3. Canon colour science is brilliant. Now, I will tell you why it may just not be the right camera just yet!  Con's & Not so Con's:  1. Canon, even though one of the oldest player took a lot of time to implement mirrorless and IBIS. 2. Sony on the other hand came in like a storm with their Alpha series when Canon 5D series was ruling the market. 3. What canon did over a decade, Sony was able to pull out magic in just couple of years. 4. Canon has never considered a good 4K slow-mo on their cameras & crop on the sensor when you bump frame rates is such a turnoff. On the other hand Sony has brilliant slow-mo. 5. Also Canon has come up with their new lens range for R Series camera. It will set you back a lot of money as the red rings are amazing but expensive. 6. Canon cameras perform extremely well with Canon glass. But Sony overall does a decent job with third party lens. Undoubtably Canon wins this one. L series lens with Canon body is any day better than Sony glass on Sony body. (Sony is slowly catching up there for sure). 7. DYNAMIC RANGE & LOW LIGHT - I cannot stress enough on these 2 factors. Canon is definitely amazing in these 2 categories. Sony is notches ahead of Canon. A7S2 can literally see in pitch dark situations. (Sorry Canon, but - Sony) Overall Verdict:  I am still a canon shooter and will forever love what Canon did in the initial days. But now the competition is cutthroat and Canon needs to pace up. EOS R5 is one such attempt. But, with Blackmagic providing 6K RAW (with editing solutions out of the box) for 2500$ and all the camera enthusiasts awaiting Sony's A7S3 launch. It might just not be the right time yet to invest in Canon EOS R5. If I were you I would wait for Sony's launch (which I am sure is coming sooner than later) and later decide upon the pick. If Sony disappoints, I would strongly vouch for Blackmagic PCC6K as for the price tag, it is just way too delicious.  P.S: I am still a canon shooter (Canon 5DM4). I am not promoting or degrading any product/company here. I am definitely not paid by any of them (Even though I wish I was).

But even so, I don't consider myself to be a professional.  To me, the word professional is very ambiguous. The real meaning of the word \\\"professional\\\" is that you are making a living out of your photography, so in this case the camera must be able to produce photos with image quality that surpass the minimum photo-publishing requirements. In this case, a 700D with its 18MP Canon sensor that's also being used in the 7D meets the requirement, as the image quality produced by the 700D will satisfy at the very least the minimum standard requirement of many photographers; so it's safe to say it's good enough to be considered a \\\"professional camera\\\". A lot of low-budget studios where I live, which I consider to be professional photography studio, even still use the good-old 500D for passport headshots and similar stuffs, and they make money from it; that makes the 500D a \\\"professional camera\\\". I'm pretty sure that the photos from the 700D are also good enough to even get pass the very strict requirement of a lot of professional stock photography agencies. So there's that one kind of professional.    On the other hand, the assumed meaning of the word \\\"professional camera\\\" that the camera manufacturers and marketing departments tried to emphasize to us is the camera with the most feature packed with a very high price-level. Well, in this case, the 700D is not a professional camera, and the manufacturer will push you towards a 7D, 5D or 1D, in hope that you'll buy those products with a much higher margin to both cover the operational cost of the manufacturer and make more profit for the company. They don't care if you make a living out of your camera or not, but the 7D, 6D, 5D, and 1D are professional cameras. That's another kind of professional.  Now let's discuss the 700D specifically. I don't personally own the 700D but I used to own a 650D for one year, and it's spec'ed very similar to the 700D. The 650D/700D can shoot 18MP RAW or JPEG with a CMOS sensor that's very similar to the sensor on the high-end Canon 7D. It does shoot at 4 or 5fps burst image, it shoot 30fps video at 1080p, it has a decent viewfinder, and a good all-around control as well as menu.   Upgrading from a 650D/700D to a 7D, a \\\"professional\\\" camera, will give you faster burst image at 8fps, weather-sealing, better view-finder, more extensive manual control, and a heavier body. But it will not give you a better image quality.   Upgrading to a 5D Mark III will give you a somewhat cleaner image quality at high ISO, better control, better viewfinder, weather-sealing, better video output, but you're back with 5fps burst speed, and you'll have to invest to full-frame lenses.   Upgrading to 1D, you'll get 7D fast-performance with an almost-5D-like image quality, but it'll cost you as much as a used decent car.  Now the important question that you'll have to ask for yourself is: will you make more money if you have a 7D, 6D, 5D, or a 1D? Maybe yes, maybe no. But one thing for sure, you'll have to spend more money to buy those cameras than if you buy the 700D. Can you justify that? Do you really need to have those features on those so-called professional cameras, or can you live with just the features on the 700D?  I personally don't give too much thought about using the so-called professional cameras. As long as I can deliver the results needed by the clients or by yourself, I think I'm happy. My 650D could deliver the result that I require back then, and to my book, it's good enough. I don't know about you, nor do I know about your photography requirement, so I can't speak for you.  To conclude, I quoted a small part of David Thorpe's blog post with the title \\\"Is This Camera Professional\\\". David Thorpe is an ex-photojournalist from UK, a true professional photographer in my opinion. Here's that quote:   %3E When John Downing took the classic picture of a stunned Margaret Thatcher leaving the Imperial hotel in Brighton, England, after the IRA had bombed it, he had been having a drink in the bar. The bomb went off and John couldn't get to his room to get his \\u2018proper' cameras. But he he had a Canon Sureshot, the same as my mum used on holiday, in his pocket.  And it was on the Sureshot that the pic was made.  That makes it a professional camera in my book. Cameras are not professional, people are. An Olympus Pen in Sebastaio Delgado's hands is a professional camera. A Nikon D4 in my sister's is not.

The Canon in D or Pachelbel's Canon, as it has come to be known, was originally the Canon and Gigue for 3 violins and Basso Continuo. The Gigue, in bright 12/8 time, is rarely played.  The piece remained in obscurity for hundreds of years until a 1968 recording became popular. Since then, it has become a wedding staple.  It works nicely as a wedding processional (for either the wedding party or for the bride), as it's in a relaxed walking tempo. The bass plays an 8-note pattern and then repeats it 27 more times.  The bass plays the pattern once by itself. On the next repetition of the bass pattern, the first violin begins a melody. The second violin begins the same melody on the next repetition of the bass pattern and the third violin begins the same melody on the next repetition. The violins all play the same melody, one repetition apart.  In a CANON, several voices play the same music entering in sequence.

Let me give you this piece of advice: your camera is the least important thing in your camera bag. Lenses and lighting are far more important, and by far the most important piece of gear is the one between your ears. Invest your money accordingly.  A 5DS r is going for $3,700 new. An EOS R is going for $2000 for just the body. So I'm going to say your total budget is around $4500. A good rule of thumb is to spend 30% of your budget on the body and 70% on lenses. That gives you a budget of around $1350 for a camera body.  As a novice, you just don't need the capabilities of a state of the art camera. I have a 5D mark IV, and honestly 95% of the time any one of my older cameras (5D mark II, 7D, 50D) is going to do the job well enough.  Bottom line is that any pro-grade DSLR made in the last 10 years is going to serve your needs perfectly well. Save your money and buy a used 5D mark III ($900-$1200) or even a 5D mark II ($500\\u2013$800). Some reputable dealers for used equipment are B&H, Adorama, Abe's of Maine, KEH, and 42nd Street Photo.  Pair that body with a good general-purpose zoom lens like the EF 24\\u201370 f/4L IS ($900) to start with. The only other must-have accessories you need with that are a circular polarizing filter (around $100) and good tripod. That is a great kit to get you started learning photography.  Save the rest of your money for now until you reach the creative limits of your initial kit\\u2026 You shouldn't buy anything you don't have a specific need for. You might also seriously consider taking some of the money you save and spending it on some photography classes at your local community college.  What your second lens is going to be depends on the direction you go with your photography. My second lens was the EF 100 f/2.8L macro because I was limited in my ability to do flower pictures by not having a macro lens. My next several purchases were lighting gear. I've bought other pieces of equipment over the years to add new capabilities to allow me to do things I couldn't do with the equipment I had at the time. Avoid the temptation to buy things just because they're new and shiny.

And I think they made some good decisions, and a few bad ones that may have not been choices as much as technical limitations.  Neither Canon nor Nikon were actually new to mirrorless with last August's introductions. But the R and the Z are professional formats, even if the first models are not a match for the top-of-the-line DSLRs yet. Both Canon and Nikon took on the idea that mirrorless was something less than DSLR, a step between DSLR and compact digital cameras (aka point and shoot). Nikon's 1 system used the same 1\\u2033 sensor size found in high-end P&S cameras like the Sony RX10 and RX100. But Canon put out a very compact APS-C system with their EOS M. And a funny thing happened: while Nikon's 1 system is now defunct, the EOS M is very popular, albeit not necessarily in the USA. Canon's been the #2 mirrorless brand in Japan in 2016 and 2017 (BCN rankings, second to Olympus) and looks to be taking the #1 spot for the 2018 year\\u2026 without even counting the EOS R. Canon seems to have nailed the consumer mirrorless ILC with the EOS M.  So it should be no surprise that Canon got into mirrorless on a higher level with the EOS R, but then again, it should be. Canon is slower to react to competition than just about anyone. Why this, why now? Canon feels the competition.  For most of history since maybe the 1940s or 1950s, Canon and Nikon had much of the professional market for cameras. In the 1960s, led by Nikon, they won an 80% share, and it's been pretty much 80\\u201390% ever since. Canon managed to flip the market share on Nikon by being the first to court consumers, and then by delivering the fastest speeds for pro sports shooters. But for a long time, the only 35mm, then full-frame choice for most pros was Nikon or Canon.  This last year, the whole industry sold only 11.6 million ILCs, less than half of those sold in 2013. And 2017 was actually an 8% increase from 2016. But more the point, DSLRs sold only accounted for 65% of the ILC market\\u2026 clearly, Nikon and Canon were no longer winning an 80\\u201390% share. And while Canon's mirrorless sales were up 70% in 2017, Nikon wasn't even part of that. And of course, neither was competitive with Sony, Olympus, Panasonic, or Fujifilm in higher-end mirrorless. No one knows just where the DSLR vs. mirrorless ratio settles out in the long term, but it's not going to be terribly favorable to any company only making DSLRs.  What's It For?  If you look carefully at the EOS R, like the Nikon Z's, you'll know just what it's for: the EOS R is a mirrorless body for Canon users to buy, so that they don't buy Sonys. This is the big factor. Canon users have been trying Sony A7s with adapters, and liking them. Some keep it as an accessory, but some sell their Canon gear and move to Sony. Canon needs that to stop, and their first reaction to this situation is the EOS R.  Canon's introducing one body and four lenses, two of them quite expensive, but still, that's not a full system for nearly anyone who needs a system camera. It's a start. But if you're already a Canon shooter, the R is with an adapter is going to let you try out mirrorless with all of your glass \\u2014 even EF-S lenses, but EF-M lenses are impossible \\u2014 your existing batteries and flash units, etc. It's a much simpler way to experiment with mirrorless for today's Canon shooter. If you're new to ILCs and want full-frame mirrorless, EOS R won't be a great option for at least 3\\u20135 years, depending on how quickly Canon rolls out new glass.  So you're supposed to compare the EOS R to a Sony A7 Mark III, but the closest match is actually the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV. So you're getting more or less a mirrorless 5D Mark IV with some improvements/extra features for $900 less. That's a pretty fine deal, speaking from the Canon universe. It's a bit more expensive than the A7 Mark III, but no one's more aggressive on body pricing than Sony.  I think it succeeds in its mission. If I still had my Canon system and was ready for full frame mirrorless, the EOS R is a no-brainer versus the Sony. It's not even the cost of the bodies or the minute details of the features, but the fact it's already part of my system. The cheap lens adapter is only $100, and it works perfectly. For a bit more, I could get the adapter with filter holder, simply brilliant for video work.  Video Issues  Alas, on that latter one, Canon's still being Canon, and not in a good way. They're still crippling 4K video on the EOS R, delivering the same 1.7x crop you have on the EOS 5D mark IV. If you're buying a full-frame DSLR for video, the point is to have full frame video. With that crop, you're better off going to a Panasonic GH5 or a Blackmagic Design Pocket Cinema Camera 4K, depending on your needs.  I expect for most stills work, you have a 5D Mark IV as far as the quality goes. You won't quite match Sony in very low light, but you'll have a bit more resolution in bright light, so it's probably not a big deal for most photographers. You'll have the Canon color, which Sony has yet to match, and the Canon menus you're used to\\u2026 well, maybe. They have a few new controls on the camera, which changes around the way its used. There's a programmable ring control on lenses, but you won't run into that with adapted EF lenses unless you get the third adapter, the one with the ring control. There's also a touch strip on the back, which most reviewers aren't yet crazy about.  Neither Sony nor Canon has 10-bit in-camera video, which is what you need for serious Log shooting. But the EOS R does have that as an external option, at least. I'd bet on Sony's A7S Mark III offering 10-bit in some fashion, but like Canon, Sony's got their own cinema camera business they feel compelled to protect by crippling the mirrorless models. Oddly, though, Nikon opted for the same thing, in-camera 8-bit, external 10-bit, even without a video market to protect. I guess that leaves them both with a feature to add to a higher end model, next year. Or save money and buy the GH5 right now.  Conclusions  So basically, I think the EOS R is attractive to anyone with a full Canon system thinking about mirrorless. If Canon's annoying behaviors haven't driven you away yet, this may well be your mirrorless. I don't really find any huge problems with it. Knowing that Sony was the initial target, nothing about the EOS R or the Nikon Zs were particularly unexpected. Both aim for the Sony's, Nikon at both the A7III and the A7RIII, Canon's basically doing the A7III competitor now. I would hope they're holding off an A7RIII competitor until they have some improved sensor tech, probably also going into the EOS 5DS Mark II."}, {"upvote": 6, "content": "The Canon EOS RP is the second full-frame mirrorless camera from the company.

Or none of them!   It depends on your intended use, needs, budget, and how the particular model you might prefer stacks up against the competition.   Let's look at the list of models in this series listed on the current Canon web site (US):  APS-C format:  * 70D  ($1,000)  * 7D Mark II ($1,500)  Full-frame format  * 6D ($1,400)  * 5D Mark III ($2,500)  * 5DS ($3,400)  * 5DS R ($3,600)  * 1D X ($4,600)  * 1D C ($8,000)   All of these are good at something, whether it is cinema (1D C), full-blown professional sports (1D X), ultra high resolution (5DS, 5DS R), or value (70D).  If they weren't competitive in at least some aspect, they wouldn't survive very long in the marketplace.    In the theory of evolution there is a concept known as the 'competitive exclusion principle'.  In business this is sometimes referred to as product needing a 'competitive advantage' to sustain marketshare. All of these camera models have a competitive advantage of some kind which defines them as the 'best' in a particular niche.  Which is best for you is something only you can judge in light of your particular needs and desires, and with respect to what the competition offers.  Canon (and Nikon) produce a range of cameras precisely because there isn't a single definition of 'best'.

The 1D X came with a 61-point autofocus system with face detection that also rotated as you changed the orientation of the camera. It also had an expanded ISO range to 51200, giving photographers a much greater ability to shoot in low-light situations. The camera integrated HD video capabilities, including manual audio controls as well, making it a solid choice for videographers and photographers alike.  The EOS 1D X Mark II improved upon the original 1DX in a variety of ways - it featured full HD video capabilities, including DCI 4K recording at up to 60fps. It also was provided with a continuous shooting rate of 14fps and a new autofocus system in which all AF points work to a maximum aperture of f/8, it also has an extended ISO range to a whopping 409600, making it a prime target for low-light shooters.  But the 1D is also too big and heavy unless you really need its faster speed or durability (for example, for sports photography). Nowadays, all full-frame DSLRs from Canon equipped well to handle low light situations and require just a little bit of knowledge about ISO and focus to get good quality night shots. Canon's much more affordable 5D Mark series was the first DSLR with Full-HD video and has had much to do with convincing professionals that video on a high-end DSLR is a good idea.

Budgets differ from person to person, I can't exactly tell you which one to get, but I will tell you out of my experience with shooting with these cameras which works best for what.  Let's start off looking at a few things.   Look and Feel of: APS-C vs Full Frame I commonly switch between my Mark III and 60D depending on a certain look and feel that I want for the photo. I general I would always recommend using a full-frame camera, but if I'm shooting in optimal lighting conditions, there's something about the APS-C sensors that I love. I can't put my finger on it exactly. The closest comparison I have to how I feel about APS-C vs Full Frame sensor is like watching a movie in 24 frames vs 60 frames. There's different appeals to each look and feel. (I recently came back from vacation where I used my 60D for the first time in a long time and I fell in-love with the look and feel of the pictures, I posted a bunch on my blog Cayo Coco Jeep Safari Tour - Cuba Adventures | legion X studios [ http://www.legionxstudios.com/blog/cayo-coco-jeep-safari-tour-cuba-adventures-part-1 ]  Winner: Tie (leaning towards APS-C)  Noise Performance: APS-C vs Full Frame I you plan to shoot indoors, or at night, the sensor size will make a world of difference. Full-frame cameras are a world apart from APS-C sensor cameras, and without doubt is a need.  Winner: Full-frame  Video Performance: APS-C vs Full Frame  If video is important to you, this is something to consider. Much like noise performance comparison, video performance is highly judged by its cleanness. The better noise performance in full-frame cameras make for better video capabilities.  Winner: Full-frame  I could compare other parts of the camera, and in most cases I thought for simplicity, these 3 were fine to illustrate my next point. I will not recommend buying an APS-C unless those are the only cameras within your budget. In that case starting even small with the 70D.  The first logical upgrade after that is the 6D, I would skip over the 7D and 7D mark II.  And after that I would only go as high as the 5D Mark III, unless you're made of money, and by all means the 1dx and 1dxc are both brilliant cameras.  I would also skip over the 5D R and 5D S. These cameras are super specialty, and they are intended for studio work. They have poor low light performance, and should only be used in ideal shooting conditions, such as a studio. Their 50MP sensor is made for big print ads.   Important part: This I think is the most common dilemma with a lot of shooters who take photography seriously, and want a full-frame, but can't afford the 1dx. Really it come down to the 6D vs 5D Mark III. Having used both, I can say the following. If photography is your only interest and don't care about video, get the 6D. In the 6D they removed the anti-aliasing filter, which is important to have in video mode. The removal of this filter allows the 6D to take much sharper pictures than then 5D Mark III, in a side by side comparison. If you are interested in the video capabilities, hands down must go for the 5D Mark III."}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "Which camera is the best - this is the ultimate question.

It's both.  As a full time photographer in NYC that just returned from a 4 day assignment that took me to capitol hill; in reference to brand, make, and model, in the world of professional photography, they absolutely do matter.  As far as the type of camera you need to be a professional photographer, you need the best one you can afford. And you use it to get paid work. After awhile, your rates raise, the volume of hires increases, and you get a better one. Then after awhile, history repeats itself with your rates and your hires and you get one that's better than that. And you continue doing this until you have a hasselblad. Or have died. One of the two.  This whole \\u2018the camera doesn't matter' thing constantly bleated around the community is something I'm so unbelievably tired of hearing. The top professionals use the best gear they can afford, and that's that. You don't see nat geo photographers tromping around south american rain forests with D3200's because they figured it'd help them save some money because they've \\u2018so much artistry in their craft and are like \\u2018just give me some paper, a pinhole, and some sun, and I'll expose you a pulitzer'. I don't really care how awesome you are at photography, an ISO ceiling is an ISO ceiling and that's that and you're restricted by the technical limitations of the camera body you're tethered to.  Top tier professionals use top tier gear and the two marry each other to produce the best images. This is a truism not just in photography but in each and every occupation and people use the absolute best equipment they can get their hands on in each and every field they are in.  People that tell you otherwise are just over-validating themselves.  If you're thinking of doing things on a professional level, I'd immediately start off full frame. You can pick up a Nikon D610 for around a grand these days and, if you look with a moderate amount of effort, for a hundred to two more can get a D750. I'm not as familiar with the canon line but the two manufacturers as an entry level professional should probably be the defacto starting point, if anything because their systems are so large and because lenses/components/parts are going to be the easiest to get wherever you may be.  Photography often involves travel and in the lesser metropolitan areas, you may not be in such luck to find a last minute batter charger made for say, Pentax.  The reason I say go full frame is because at this point there isn't going to be a huge cost difference between that and cropped sensor and because full frame  1. Typically yields a better image quality (switching from ASP-C to full frame was revelatory) 2. Will be more versatile in low light conditions. Additionally, you probably won't specialize in much when you first start doing professional photography, and so having a cam that's going to allow you to perform in a myriad set of conditions is also going to be useful (once again, I reference low-light).  Also, one area that many burgeoning photographers neglect is lighting. Going into a portrait shoot, I'd much rather have a $500 camera and $10k worth of lighting, as opposed to a $50k camera and $100 worth of lighting.  Invest in a cheap speedlight off of ebay, with a shoot through umbrella and an inexpensive sync kit and you'll already be light years ahead of many of the competitors currently in your bracket. My feeling is that many people that start off as budding photogs flounder around as natural light photographers for an incredibly long time, producing unremarkable images, before eventually burning out and giving up. In the event you start off with off camera lighting, you'll have already skipped a dozen grades going into the profession.  Get the best camera you can afford.

Not only is the 1D X around $6,000 (body-only), but you're going to need expensive CFast cards for 4K video, and the 4K video on the thing is in gigantic Motion JPEG files, and not all that amazing anyway. If I wanted a 4K camera for video, I'd recommend either get a Panasonic GH4 or perhaps a Sony A7s mark II.  The Nikon D80 (2006) and the D3 (2007) are ancient models and don't shoot video. The D3s does shoot video, but only 720p, not full HD.  The EOS 7D (2009) is also fairly old. It can shoot 720p or 1080p video, but only 12 minutes at a time. The others here can shoot 29\\u203259\\u2033 without stopping \\u2014 that's a limit set to avoid paying a European camcorder tax. While it doesn't apply at all in the USA, most camera manufacturers (other than Panasonic, far as I know) impose this limit even on North American and Japanese models.  The Nikon D5300 isn't a bad choice for video. It's a few models old, it came out in 2003, the current model is the D5600, so it's may be available for a value price. But this line is a consumer line, APS-C sensor, and not terribly expensive. It can shoot video at 1080p up to 60fps\\u2026 not something you'd need for vlogging, but you want 60p for sports or other action video. Another advantage for vlogging, the D5300 has built-in WiFi, so it can be controlled wirelessly via an app. Most Canon and Nikon can be tethered via USB for remote control, and some have add-on controls, but it's handy to have it built-in.  I have the EOS 6D, and it produces amazing video, particularly in low light, where it blows away my far more expensive dedicated camcorders. The 6D right now is a good bargain, but mostly because everyone expects Canon to announce the 6D mark II Real Soon Now. The 6D also has built-in WiFi.  The EOS 5D mark III is the upgrade of Canon's breakthrough EOS 5D mark II. It's a great camera, one of the go-to standards for video-on-stills camera shooting. But while it's a solid choice if you can afford it, it's not the best choice. For one, it's been superceeded by the EOS 5D mark IV, if you're looking for a higher end model that shoots great video.  Of those on your list, the Canon EOS 80D would be my choice for anyone wanting a strong video option. Like the Nikon, it can shoot a variety of modes up to 1080p60. But the real advantage is in the sensor. This is Canon's second-generation mid-range DSLR with what they call a Dual Pixel sensor. This sensor splits each pixel into two separate photodiodes. Based on the way they're masked, each sensor pair works like a phase-detect autofocus sensor. So unlike every other DSLR on your list, the 80D can give you full performance autofocus in video, and things you usually just find on camcorders and mirrorless cameras, like follow-focus in video, etc. Dual Pixel is also used on Canon's 5D mark IV and all the new Cinema EOS video cameras. And the 80D also has built-in WiFi.  Far as the larger idea of a full camera system goes, you can't really go wrong with either Canon or Nikon. They have the two most complete lines of cameras and two most complete collection of lenses. However, neither offers a mirrorless option. So that means you're only shooting video from the back screen, not the viewfinder. And that only the 80D on your list has fully function video autofocus\\u2026 the others will AF in video, but it's on demand, not continuous, and it's often not very good. The phase detect sensors that DSLRs use are not available with the mirror up, which is what you have in video mode.  For one-person vlogging, keep in mind you are going to want to see yourself, which means either an add-on monitor while shooting or an articulated screen. The 80D and the D5300 both have fully articulated screens which let you see what you're recording from the front of the camera. The others do not, and will absolutely require an external monitor for vlogging."}, {"upvote": 78, "content": "I see a lot of answers claiming \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" for photography in general. Do not get this line of thinking stuck in your head because it's not entirely true. In fact, to be honest, this statement is used many times by people who simply can't afford good gear and are jealous at those who can. If you can't afford good gear right now, that's fine; work with what you can afford and save up money to grow into better gear over time. The best camera is always the one you have with you and by this I mean, if you own a $6,500 Canon 1DX and it's sitting at home, your best camera may be the free one that came built into the phone in your pocket!  While it is true, skill is the most important aspect of almost anything, including photography, your gear and even more specifically, your lenses, are just as important. A good lens on an inexpensive camera is always better than a cheap lens on an expensive camera. If you're just starting out and looking for a camera for a beginner, try to think about what sort of photography you'll be doing. General photography such as family photos, photos of your friends, pets, etc.; landscape photography; wildlife photography; street photography, etc. If you don't know yet, that's okay but if you have a goal of developing skills specific to one of these styles, it will help with camera selection.  When getting started, I'd get something inexpensive but not so cheap that your photo quality ends up discouraging you altogether (again, this is where the \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" nonsense kicks in.) I'll cover a couple types and why they're good starter cameras. And with any camera you choose, always try to keep the camera out of \\\"automatic mode\\\" if possible so you begin to master the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  Point-and-Shoot or Camera Phone  These cameras are very inexpensive and with the newer smartphones, the camera is built right in and often takes better photos than the DSLR's from just a few years ago! This is the most inexpensive route to take (and may not cost a penny if you use the camera on your phone) and it helps you learn about composition, lighting, etc. If you're already past this point and want a camera you can grow into, the following are good options:  Traditional SLR's  I know, this is probably not what most people think of when deciding on a beginner's camera but I want to mention it because if you have one of these lying around in your house (parent's or grandparent's old camera, etc.), they're great for learning the basics of a camera with all of the digital stuff removed. SLR (single lens reflex) cameras aren't used much anymore because of the cost of operation, decreased photo quality, and lack of film processing labs, however, I think any aspiring photographer should own or at least use one because they are the \\\"original camera\\\", they are inexpensive, and they help give you a greater appreciation for the luxury of digital photography (not limited to 24-36 photos per roll, immediate results where you can see your photo seconds after taking it, easy and fast multiple frame shooting, and no cost by ruining a roll of film or wasting it on bad photos.) If you buy a traditional SLR 35mm camera, I'd go for something like the Nikon 35mm F2AS with a 50mm \\\"prime lens\\\", or similar. Here's a photo of one of mine:  Digital SLR's  Digital SLR's, or DSLR's, have been the most popular choice for many years now, they're easy to find used, and they're a good starting point in learning photography. These cameras are basically digital versions of the original SLR camera but offer much more flexibility and many more options. Whagt we're seeing right now, however, is a switch from DSLR's to \\\"mirrorless cameras\\\", including the very popular \\\"Micro Four Thirds\\\" cameras which use a smaller sensor, yet often outperform the DSLR's. I'll touch on those, below. Anyway, an inexpensive or used DSLR is a good choice for starting out and I'd recommend an entry level Canon DSLR such as one of the \\\"Rebel\\\" series cameras. I currently use a Canon 1DX which is NOT a beginner's camera, and my old Canon 5D Mark II (this is a great beginner's camera, easy to find, and inexpensive.) Here's a photo of the Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm prime lens attached:  Mirrorless Cameras  These cameras really are \\\"the future of photography\\\" although many professional photographers would scoff at you for even suggesting such a thing because just as it was when SLR's were phasing out, DSLR using pro's often get stuck in their ways and refuse to move with the times. Even today there are professional photographers who refuse to switch from SLR to DSLR! Mirrorless cameras are superior to DSLR's in almost every way: They have higher resolution (megapixels) for a fraction of the cost of DSLR's; there's no mirror flapping around making noise and causing camera vibration; they're smaller and easier to carry, many can shoot 4K and even Cinema 4K video (while Canon and Nikon refuse to adapt and offer this feature for a reasonable price in their DSLR's); and overall, they're less expensive. If you can afford one (they're often cheaper than many new DSLR's), go for it! I currently shoot with a Panasonic Lumix GH4 because I shoot photography AND I need to shoot 4K video and this camera does both. An even less expensive alternative is the Lumix GH3 which sells for around $500, a quarter of the price of the GH4. Here's a photo of the Lumix GH4, a \\\"mirrorless camera\\\":  Regardless of what you choose, unless it's a cheap $30 point-and-shoot or your phone's camera, try to make a decision on which camera format you want to grow into, otherwise you'll be wasting money on a camera and the expensive lenses that you'll end up not using when you switch to a different format.  Taking an introductory photography class or workshop is also a good idea when getting started as you'll more quickly learn the basics including aperture, exposure, shutter speed, composition, and editing.

Also if it were several people in charge that have to write a constitution, it's even worse, because writing a constitution with many people is always victim of special interests, lobbying and the like. 2. A design that doesn't prevent cartel formation. Cartels always happen if it is possible. 3.

If you choose to click the images with an interval of 5 seconds, you would need you camera to click picture for \\u2192 5 x 12 x 25 = 1500 seconds or 25 minutes.

My suggestion would be to buy and shoot a few dozen memory cards worth of images on the very inexpensive 18-55. Find its limits, where it does well and where it doesn't, what causes aberration and where it is or isn't sharp. Are you always shooting at the 55mm end of it? Pick up a used 50 f1.8 for $40ish and your image quality will improve a bit at wide aperatures. Always at the low end? Consider the 10-22 for the extra wide angle.

It is safe to use it, since you can rollback to your original camera OS anytime, easily and completely forget about ML. Truly magical to me.  Where? Magic Lantern | Home [ http://www.magiclantern.fm/ ]  Why? Because 70D doesn't have a built-in timer for time lapse type photography.  What is the cost? Free (and open source)  I have been using this app for around a year now - only for time lapse photography. Before that I had an external device which was useful too. When you are making a time lapse with long exposure shots, the external device becomes a bit bother-y(at times if not tethered properly) as it may swing in the air and may hit a tripod leg creating a slight vibration(which may spoil a picture in your time lapse sequence). Also at times one may forget to bring the device itself or may misplace the device and the whole time lapse plan is spoilt. These are from my personal experiences. Also, it needs a battery to keep it going(although you don't have to change it too often).  But with this app/add-on you can have the time lapse settings right inside your camera and much much more. Check out their website or some youtube tutorials to find out its capabilities.  I guess you can shoot HDR videos using ML too. There are some tutorials which says how to shoot and edit to create 4K videos using ML. (Both of these require fair amount of post processing though).  It needs a bit of learning and a lot of getting used to the app and it's interface. I do not like it's interface a lot. And I am still learning the tool.

You always need some kind of scene that works as a time-lapse. Large, slow changes like the sun and shadow, or low puffy clouds work well. A lot of walking, and staring at scenes for a while might tease these out, or at least the chance of something happening. Sometimes this can take time. If you have time, check the sun and shadows moving about surfaces, or make calculated guesses with a sunrise and sunset position app. The more you make, the more they show you where they are.  Be mentally prepared for failure. The gorgeous clouds may turn lame right after you start, or just disappear, and if you stop, you have another annoying, one second clip because you only sat there for 25 frames. If you stop, something awesome might happen like a golden sunset. You could show up with the wrong lens, or a dead battery. It could start raining. You could get hit by tornadoes. The point is that regardless of your level of skill, things you have no control over can happen when you are stuck in one place for minutes or hours, or days. Don't feel bad when one shot goes sour. It's a good idea to get used to this idea, and this attitude helps your patience which will be surely tested by time-lapse photography.  Now your head is set up, and you've picked a scene, we need some particular equipment.  Obviously you need a camera with a full battery and a strong tripod. Wind will teach you to use a strong tripod for time-lapse.  Most any DSLR can run at least 600 frames on a battery today, so just make sure it is full.  You might want to fashion a shade to keep from frying your camera in the sun. Just seems like a good idea. Motion picture houses have a little eyebrow flag called a French Flag, that often comes on a flexible arm with a clamp on the other end. Clamping this on a tripod leg and shading your camera will give you some serious peace of mind.  On most cameras, you need a time-lapse intervalometer to make exposures at timed intervals. They are inexpensive, and you can buy just about any kind on line, like this example:  A typical intervalometer.  A few things about this intervalometer. The first thing, which is not really visible here, is that this one uses common AAA batteries. Many use weird coin cells that you will always run out of or forget to bring, and seem to go bad quickly, as well as cost an annoying amount at the rural store you struggled to find nearby. Throwing a big pack of AAA batteries in the bottom of your bag is a pleasant rescue later when you are out making pics.  Second, also not pictured, get a two foot long piece of coat hanger or romex wire, and wrap one end around the bottom of the intervalometer, like where the gray tape in on this one, and the other end around your tripod where the head attaches to the center column. This gets rid of the infuriating dangle situation, and you can bend the coat hanger to face the intervalometer any convenient direction, like up so you can see of course.  Third, intervalometers have particular connectors compatible with only particular cameras. There are many standards, and you need to make sure you get the one that fits your equipment. Here are a few commonly seen ones:  2.5mm input in a lower end EOS Canon DSLR camera. T3i, T4i etc\\u2026  Three prong locking connector on higher end Canon cameras.  Rectangular connector common on many lower end Nikon cameras like the D3100 and D3200. I think there are at least two different rectangular connectors out there.  No shutter input on old some Nikon low end cameras like the D40, D50, D70 etc. This is a USB port. If your camera does not have an input, it would be a good idea to just look at getting another camera.  The professional Nikon cameras use a large multipin connector but this is not a concern because Professional Nikon cameras have no need for an external intervalometer, so you will never need any connector or batteries or coat hangers or any of that nonsense.  Some Canon cameras like the 5DII, 5DIII, T2i, T3i, 50D, 60D etc, can use magic lantern firmware. Lantern has extensive intervalometer capabilities, so on these cameras that's an idea to look into.  Moving on, since the frame rate of your time-lapse will be probably several seconds per frame, your scene will be too bright to have the shutter open half of that time like a movie camera. This will make a jittery scene, as fast moving objects will be frozen in each frame, appearing to pop in and out of the scene instead of moving smoothly through. To fix this problem you need a ton of ND filtration. ND is important.  An ND filter. Just a tinted window.  It's just a dimmer like window tint, but unfortunately they are labeled in all sorts of stupid ways.  4X just means, everything else being the same, you would need four times the exposure, or in other words, a quarter of the light gets through.  Some manufacturers will call this same filter ND 0.6, for the log density of the filter. Makes more sense to old school photographers and printers. 0.3 would be the same as 2X. 0.9 would be 8X and so on.  Then, some manufacturers describe their filters in stops. ND 0.6 or 4x, would be called Two Stop. ND 0.9 or 8X would be called Three Stop.  As with any filter, it has to be well made and flat to not ruin the sharpness of your image. Heliopan, B+W and Hoya are a few companies that make accurate filters. Don't make your expensive leans a cheap lens.  You'll have to do the math for what you need, but for an example, if your scene was in broad daylight, an f/5.6 exposure at ISO 100 could be 1/2000th of a second. That would look cheesy as a timelapse unless you want people to look like cartoon ants. If your exposures were every four seconds, we could just figure the ND for, say, two second exposures.  Blazing daylight gets you 1/2000th  -4 stop filter would make that 1/125th. Not enough.  -8 stops (twin 4 stop filters) would get us to 1/8th.  -10 stops? 1/2 second.  Ten stops is a pretty strong filter. From here you could just stop down to f/11 and get to 2s exposures. Ready to go.  A two stop, a couple of four stops, and a ten stop is pretty much everything you would need.  From here you just set up your camera, put on the ND that gets you the exposure you want, set the intervalometer for what you want, which is probably about twice as long as the exposure you picked, and try to sit back for at least a couple hundred exposures. After eight seconds, which in our four second interval example is a bit over three minutes, you have at least a usable clip, and can decide if you want to keep rolling.  I should mention that you may run into an interesting problem here. Each exposure, the camera will stop down the lens from wide open. This is often not perfect, and may introduce a small amount of flicker that can be really irritating if that is not the look you are after. You can try to remove it with software, but this can be solved by shooting wide open, or in the case of Canon cameras, you can use an adapter and put the wrong lens on from another manufacturer. The adapters cannot control the lens aperture, so the lens behaves pre-set, as in, always topped down to your selected aperture. Since the lens aperture is not connected, the aperture stays in the exact same position and you get solid time-lapse images as well as access to a lot of cool lenses. Olympus OM, Contax MM or AE Carl Zeiss, M42 vintage Asahi Pentax, even Nikon are a few common options. Nikon cameras are at a disadvantage in this area as there is no way to use a lens adapter without glass lenses to restore infinity focus.  If it doesn't work out, try again!  Hope this helps.  Woops. Edit for spelling typos."}, {"upvote": 4, "content": "It would really help if you posted the timelapse video in question. Without being able to see your problem I can list a few possibilities  1. You are shooting the timelapse in aperture priority and the camera is selecting longer and longer shutter times as it gets darker in the evening. I generally always shoot in full manual mode to avoid flicker in my timelapse (LRTimelapse is a great tool to even out the the exposure). 2. You left the camera with autofocus turned on, as it gets dark the camera will have a harder time acquiring focus on the scene and eventually just be out of focus. Again, let I do with exposure on the camera, I typically set focus the camera manually and leave it alone for the entire timelapse sequence 3.

I don't know if Ethereum will continue on to be as large of a market leader as it is today, but it's definitely not going anywhere.  Why?   * First mover advantage. As I've explained in further detail below, Ethereum was the first platform token to allow widespread creation of tokens. Before NEO, EOS, and other competitors could even get their white papers out\\u2014 Ethereum had already had several successful ICO's launch on their platform.  One could bring up the MySpace vs. Facebook argument, MySpace was first too. No one knows what good ole' Tom is up to these days. But as you'll see in the charts below, the early mover advantage in this particular case brought the benefit of billions of dollars in support.   * They're just claims. While a lot of companies claim to be better than Ethereum, that's all they are at this point, just claims. No one has put their money where there mouth is and really shown how their platform solves the scalability issues of Ethereum. EOS claims to be Ethereum on Steroids, that's literally what E O S stands for. Yet their main net hasn't launched, and there's no proof in the pudding so far.  NEO released shortly after Ethereum. I see NEO as the closest competitor, but haven't seen the volume of dApps necessary for it to really pose a threat.   * Ethereum has billions of dollars in funding already raised through ERC20 tokens launching on its platform. Ethereum created an onramp for anyone with a decent idea (and unfortunately a lot of people with bad ones) to create their own token. The advent of ERC20 tokens changed the game. Now anyone with a mild understanding of Solidity can tokenize practically anything.  Ethereum is responsible for the ICO craze we saw in 2017, when coins were launching left and right. Sometimes raising 100's of millions of dollars in funding. In 2017 alone, a total of $6,101,438,558 raised across 871 ICO's.  Chart can be found here.

If Ethereum were to fail, so would these coins.  At the end of the day, there is too much money invested in companies built on top of the Ethereum network for ETH to go anywhere, anytime soon.

However if I'm to set up a crypto portfolio, I'd use bitcoin (own the king) as the lead indicator, then pick smaller coins that will bounce back more as long as Bitcoin's trend is ok.  I'd put 20% in Bitcoin, 30% in Ethereum and I will distribute the remaining 50% amongst smaller altcoins..  I hope this help, keep on Hodling.  Cheers!"}, {"upvote": 31, "content": "I wouldn't compare them directly like that. I just spend a good 2 days reading up on NEM and why its a good investments and came up with the following points:  NOTE: I personally like the fact NEMs code seems to be better done than Ethereum, I was talking to a programer friend of mine and he mentioned NEMs API actually works wonders, making it a great option when trying to adapt business already exiting systems to the blockchain through NEM.  Also, I got these things to say after reading the white paper, watching videos and asking questions on Reddit's communities.  Feel free to check out the original post of why buy NEM [ http://il-mato.biz/why-invest-in-nem/ ] according to my research, I have also added videos and other useful resources that are not in here. That said, here are the main points of said argument:  Ease of use for developers  NEM offers an amazing API that allows for any programming language to be used providing all programmers with the ability of develope on NEM with the language they are most confident with.  This also allows for ease of integration with existing systems which should make NEM the choice for enterprises with existing systems who want to change to blockchain solutions without having to start from 0.   %3E NEM's blockchain exposes its functionality through a powerful API interface that can be used with any programming language, not a specific smart contract language. Existing business logic code can easily mate up and use blockchain where it's strongest: secure transactions and ledger keeping. In short, configure NEM for your business, and then deploy blockchain incrementally and without forced retooling of existing infrastructure. If there's one thing I believe in is ease of use, those platforms that make it as easy as possible to integrate them to already existing systems will be the ones chosen. I think NEM has a great chance to establish itself as the most user/developer friendly platform on the market.  Even more secure than most blockchains  The Blockchain is by default very secure and hard to hack, you would literally have to hack all nodes in the system in order to compromise the data within it, which of course is such a big undertaking is pretty much impossible to orchestrate. NEM takes that security even further by using a trust-based algorithm and allowing developers to choose between a private and public blockchain solutions. The architecture of the system is geared for security:   %3E NEM's architecture provides an incredibly secure and stable platform through its use of Eigentrust++ and an incentivized public node network based on its two-tier architecture. The significant risks inherent in on-blockchain smart contracts are eliminated by providing building block customization to NEM functionality that keeps application security in your hands, not on the blockchain. And NEM's private blockchain option allows complete control over internal data privacy when a public blockchain isn't the right solution. NEM it's both Public and Private blockchain solution  That's right, NEM offers the perfect solution for enterprises because it offers a private blockchain solution to businesses that don't want their data to be absolutely public.  This means NEM is one of the few platforms offering enterprise solutions to business, unlike other cryptos, it does not attempt to fight centralization and the status quo, rather, it wants to offer a solution to businesses looking to integrate blockchain to their operations.  The private version of NEM is called the Mijin platform [ https://nem.io/enterprise/mijin/ ] and it promises to become the go-to platform for all enterprises looking to jump onto the blockchain revolution.   %3E Public blockchains such as NEM allow anyone to join the network to freely share and receive data. However, most businesses require their information to be kept confidential. In such cases, NEM provides a customizable approach through their permissioned ledgers an based on NEM technology, Mijin provides this powerful functionality. In such cases, NEM provides a customizable approach through a private permissioned ledger option based on the same NEM platform technology. Tech Bureau provides an excellent packaged NEM private blockchain solution in the form of their Mijin product.  NEM provides the ability to seamlessly build upon any previous systems that have been developed in the blockchain arena, without the need for rewriting any existing code. Super Fast Transactions  Takes about 6 seconds to happen and around 20 to confirm, the speed might reduce as use increases, but this effect will be countered by more supernodes joining the network and sharing the load  So, in theory, the networks will always remain as fast as it is now, which is always a great factor when it comes to mass adoption.  Extremely Scalable  One of the lowest transaction fees in crypto  0.01% when using the official nano wallet so paying 10 cents to send $1000 does seem like an incredibly good deal.  Add this to the fact your transaction will get there almost immediately, you can see NEM has the potential to become a method of payment that makes a lot of sense to use.  It is transparent, not private  I know lot's of people want absolute untraceable and private transactions, which is s great thing under certain circumstances, but there are other coins you can use to buy your drugs, NEM is not for that.  That said, keep in mind that 100% private transactions don't tend to do very well when it comes to mass adoption, Bitcoin itself got in a lot of trouble in the past (still suffers from this) because it's connection to black/illegal markets and money laundering, NEM does not suffer from this putting it in an excellent position to be used as a legit and transparent way of payment for customers and business alike.  It allows for customer protection and tracking of spending habits, which are incentives for mass adoption for businesses and customers alike.  It can be used for any type of asset or \\u2018Mosaics' as they are known within the system  NEM is an extremely malleable and dynamic blockchain it can be used for an almost infinite amount of assets. Any asset can be turned into a Mosaic and transferred/stored in the blockchain.  Take XEM, the defacto cryptocurrency of the NEM blockchain. XEM is a mosaic within the NEM platform that allows for the transfer of value, the same way you can create XEM, you can digitalize and store any other type of assets as a different Mosaics.  Whether it be digital content like video, documents filled with important information, databases, code, anything can be created into a mosaic and integrated perfectly within the NEM system. Everything can be encrypted and kept both safe and accessible to everyone within the system  This is a very powerful aspect of NEM as it allows business to implement blockchain solutions to any of their assets, whether it be for internal use in a private secure blockchain or for public use and accessible to a larger audience.  The more it's used, the higher the price of XEM  Ok, let's clarify this: On one side you have NEM which is the blockchain system used to develop a solution for both businesses and the public, on the other hand, you have XEM which is the cryptocurrency within NEM used to move value around.  The really cool thing about the system is that it always needs XEM to do transactions/move information around/ do whatever tasks it was designed to do.  Think about it for a second\\u2026  If the value of XEM if given by the balance of demand and supply, and the supply of them is locked at 9,000,000,000 (XEM does not suffer from inflation as this total supply will never change) what happens as more business build blockchain solutions on NEM?  That's right! The more NEM is used by enterprises, the higher the demand of XEM thus the higher the price!  Is a perfect reward system for long-term holders and investors, the more enterprises that use it, the higher the demand, the higher the price! Add this to a system based on Proof of Stake and Proof of Importance means the token will continuously increase in value ensuring the happiness of all stakeholders.  So yea, those are pretty much the main reasons I chose NEM as my next investments, there are certainly a few more if you are interested. But I cover the mains one here.  What do you think? Have you invested in NEM as swell? Have I missed anything in the above answer people should know about?

Now after winning the auction you can pair your address with the name so people can send you money to quora.eth instead of that long address.  The next phase of Ethereum development will be Metropolis which is intended to provide greater flexibility to smart contract developers. After it's release we can expect to see more usages of DApps as smart contracts will automatically be able to pay their own fees instead of you having to pay for them manually. This will increase consumer usage because it's user friendly.  The next phase will be Serenity and not much is known. But what is known so far is that there will be advanced-contract execution schemes that will allow smart contracts to become more autonomous, reducing the need for smart contracts to be externally activated.  There will also be an introduction to blockchain sharding which is the process of \\u2018cutting up the blockchain into thousands of pieces, that will allow each running node the ability to approve only their piece (or shard) of the network instead of having to do every bit whether it's theirs or not.

Depend on way you looked at it, it is basically Rebel with more features, or x0D with more Rebel like UI and limited custom function and less accessory options.  Personally, if you are not too sure about going for consumer DSLR or going for more prosumer or enthusiast body, I would think you are better off getting Rebel line of products for your first DSLR and use extra money on lens and other accessory. 77D is type of body that born out of compromise, and that is serving fairly specific niche group of users in mind.

It is also the reason that 80D costs you bit more than 77D.  Anyway, check out the major specification difference between these two cameras:  AF system  To be honest, Canon did a great work by offering the intelligent Dual Pixel AF system even in the affordable 77D camera. Yes! Same as Canon 80D Canon also has fabricated this excellent AF system with creative 45 AF points in their 77D also, so that the users can achieve the focus of the fast moving subjects very quickly and precisely (as quick as 0.03s!)  Shutter Speed  After all, both the two cameras maintain the same range of ISO value. But the best difference or you can say a significant advantage of Canon 80D is that it avails the faster shutter of 1/8000 sec. Faster shutter speed in a camera ultimately blocks the way of distortion, plus also incredibly minimizes the rolling shutter effect while shooting fast moving subjects. Furthermore, this fast shutter speed also allows the camera to capture sharp, crystal clear images with a wide open aperture while shooting at bright light conditions. On the other hand, Canon 77D is restricted to 1/4000 sec only.  Continuous shooting speed  Not a big difference, but still Canon 80D is leading by 1fps in continuous shooting drive. As a result, a rapidly occurring scene can be captured very comfortably and the images will be very crisp and clear by Canon 80D. Canon 77D has only 6fps.  Weather sealed  Now you can see here\\u2026 Means almost exact reason why Canon 80D costs you much more than Canon 77D. Because Canon 80D has been the weather sealed body lets you continue you photography session even in the struggling shooting situations, such as shooting in Marshy land etc. Unfortunately, Canon 77D is not weather sealed camera, which means users should be very careful while shooting in the unfavorable shooting conditions.  Honestly, the photographers who are not intended to stretch their savings but still require a marvelous camera then don't look further, put you cash on Canon 77D.

(This is a good time to mention, if you didn't already know, that Korean has phonemic long and short vowels, which is unfortunate, as vowel length is not distinguished at all in the modern writing system.

Unlike Sony, who had no market share in professional DSLRs, Canon was deeply entrenched in the EF system. They had no intention of cannibalizing their DSLR lines so they never put any research into mirrorless technology like edge to edge auto focus, eye detect, silent shutter, higher fps etc. And rightfully so, for a long time, DSLRs were king and Canon was king of DSLRs.  Only recently has the advancements in mirrorless camera technology forced Canon to make a move on the market but they are still a few years away from being as good as Sony. But do not doubt one thing: They will that good, possibly better.  Mirrorless is the future, the end of DSLRs is slowly coming about - in 10 years I'm betting every pro and enthusiast will switch to mirrorless and the Canon R system will be one of the best available by sheer virtue of the fact Canon know how to design some of the best consumer grade glass in the Camera industry. The handful of RF lenses out there now are already mauling everything from Nikon and Sony.  But the EOS R itself has the problem of being intentionally held back as to not kill the 6D and 5D lines. The video and 4k features in particular. Canon's DSLRs need to become properly obsolete for the EOS R to thrive. Better phase detect AF, eye detect, FPS and silent shutter technology will get up to industry standard in the next one or two years and until then I can't really recommended buying the debut model.  If you need a Camera now and intent to buy new lenses with it, buy the EOS R. The EF mount is dead, Canon just won't admit it yet. But if you already have Canon glass and are just looking for another 5 years of shooting then 6D MII is fine. Don't invest more into EF glass unless you have to, its adaptable but what a pain in the ass.

You cannot get a specific answer with a generic question. I have just bought a 6D Mark II. I have had the original 6D for nearly three years. I shoot live music in mostly small, badly lit venues. When I bought the 6D it was Canon's best low-light camera (even better than the 5D MkII and 1DX). It was also very affordable for someone who makes very little money working in a sector with very little money. It was an upgrade from a 550D (APS-C). I had one EF-S lens for that camera \\u2013 a Tamron 17\\u201350 f/2.8 that was my go to lens. My 70\\u2013200 f/2.8 was an EF. When I upgraded, I bought a used Canon 24\\u201370 f/2.8, and a friend sold me his 16\\u201335mm f/2.8 at a bargain price. I now had a full range of full-frame lenses that I needed for the 6D. That camera has now taken close 30k photos, but no video, so I was feeling the need to get a new body (as in camera, although the physical one could do with an upgrade too) when the EOS-R was announced. Personally, I'm not overly convinced about the hype over mirrorless cameras (I do have an EOS M2 as a pocket camera), probably because I have been using an SLR since the 1970s and they have never failed, and I mostly see mirrorless as a marketing ploy to sell more gear.  I looked at the same options you have asked about and asked myself if I wanted to use a body almost identical to the one I was currently familiar with, but upgraded, or go for a new technology with a new lens mount. I then looked at my bank account and prices of the two options. I found a new 6D MkII and battery grip for under \\u00a31100. It was not a difficult decision at that point. A new camera body that would use all my existing lenses without needing an adaptor, and without the need to familiarise myself with a new body and way of working, as well as using a new system in its first iteration that would need regular firmware updates. During my next upgrade cycle I may opt for the EOS-R as all the bugs will have been sorted, and my lenses will probably need upgrading as well by then.  So, as you can see, there is no definitive answer. My advice is to never buy a camera purely from the spec sheets, or people's reviews either. You need to actually hold them in your hands and use them in the situation you intend to use them most. Don't buy a camera that is over-specced for what you are shooting. For example, do you really need a full-frame camera? If you mostly want to shoot video, would an actual video camera serve you better? And always look at your budget, and don't spend more than you need to, especially if it's a hobby.  Hope all this helps."}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "I've owned both.

It also raises the other question - if the two biggest camera makers in the world have finally gotten on the mirrorless world, how long will it be before DSLRs are a quaint thing of the past.  The important thing is that EOS R comes with a new RF mount. This brand new lens mount has the same diameter as the EF mount (54mm), but it has much shorter flange distance (20 mm vs 44mm).  Canon has produced lenses for the EF mount since 1987, so there are hundreds of different ones to choose from. On the contrary, the RF mount was introduced with the EOS R, so there are not many lenses at the moment: Canon EOS R vs Canon 5D Mark IV Comparison [ https://www.photographytalk.com/canon-eos-r-vs-canon-5d-mark-iv ]  It's a lot like it was 20 years ago when DSLRs made their first appearance.

EOS R is a peek into Canon's future. They have obviously thought a lot about what they want the EOS R line to become.

Let me give you this piece of advice: your camera is the least important thing in your camera bag. Lenses and lighting are far more important, and by far the most important piece of gear is the one between your ears. Invest your money accordingly.  A 5DS r is going for $3,700 new. An EOS R is going for $2000 for just the body. So I'm going to say your total budget is around $4500. A good rule of thumb is to spend 30% of your budget on the body and 70% on lenses. That gives you a budget of around $1350 for a camera body.  As a novice, you just don't need the capabilities of a state of the art camera. I have a 5D mark IV, and honestly 95% of the time any one of my older cameras (5D mark II, 7D, 50D) is going to do the job well enough.  Bottom line is that any pro-grade DSLR made in the last 10 years is going to serve your needs perfectly well. Save your money and buy a used 5D mark III ($900-$1200) or even a 5D mark II ($500\\u2013$800). Some reputable dealers for used equipment are B&H, Adorama, Abe's of Maine, KEH, and 42nd Street Photo.  Pair that body with a good general-purpose zoom lens like the EF 24\\u201370 f/4L IS ($900) to start with. The only other must-have accessories you need with that are a circular polarizing filter (around $100) and good tripod. That is a great kit to get you started learning photography.  Save the rest of your money for now until you reach the creative limits of your initial kit\\u2026 You shouldn't buy anything you don't have a specific need for. You might also seriously consider taking some of the money you save and spending it on some photography classes at your local community college.  What your second lens is going to be depends on the direction you go with your photography. My second lens was the EF 100 f/2.8L macro because I was limited in my ability to do flower pictures by not having a macro lens. My next several purchases were lighting gear. I've bought other pieces of equipment over the years to add new capabilities to allow me to do things I couldn't do with the equipment I had at the time. Avoid the temptation to buy things just because they're new and shiny. Every single piece of gear in your collection should fill a specific need (not a want)."}, {"upvote": 16, "content": "It's a decent start, but it also tells you a few things about Canon's thinking right now. And I think they made some good decisions, and a few bad ones that may have not been choices as much as technical limitations.  Neither Canon nor Nikon were actually new to mirrorless with last August's introductions. But the R and the Z are professional formats, even if the first models are not a match for the top-of-the-line DSLRs yet. Both Canon and Nikon took on the idea that mirrorless was something less than DSLR, a step between DSLR and compact digital cameras (aka point and shoot). Nikon's 1 system used the same 1\\u2033 sensor size found in high-end P&S cameras like the Sony RX10 and RX100. But Canon put out a very compact APS-C system with their EOS M. And a funny thing happened: while Nikon's 1 system is now defunct, the EOS M is very popular, albeit not necessarily in the USA. Canon's been the #2 mirrorless brand in Japan in 2016 and 2017 (BCN rankings, second to Olympus) and looks to be taking the #1 spot for the 2018 year\\u2026 without even counting the EOS R. Canon seems to have nailed the consumer mirrorless ILC with the EOS M.  So it should be no surprise that Canon got into mirrorless on a higher level with the EOS R, but then again, it should be. Canon is slower to react to competition than just about anyone. Why this, why now? Canon feels the competition.  For most of history since maybe the 1940s or 1950s, Canon and Nikon had much of the professional market for cameras. In the 1960s, led by Nikon, they won an 80% share, and it's been pretty much 80\\u201390% ever since. Canon managed to flip the market share on Nikon by being the first to court consumers, and then by delivering the fastest speeds for pro sports shooters. But for a long time, the only 35mm, then full-frame choice for most pros was Nikon or Canon.  This last year, the whole industry sold only 11.6 million ILCs, less than half of those sold in 2013. And 2017 was actually an 8% increase from 2016. But more the point, DSLRs sold only accounted for 65% of the ILC market\\u2026 clearly, Nikon and Canon were no longer winning an 80\\u201390% share. And while Canon's mirrorless sales were up 70% in 2017, Nikon wasn't even part of that. And of course, neither was competitive with Sony, Olympus, Panasonic, or Fujifilm in higher-end mirrorless. No one knows just where the DSLR vs. mirrorless ratio settles out in the long term, but it's not going to be terribly favorable to any company only making DSLRs.  What's It For?  If you look carefully at the EOS R, like the Nikon Z's, you'll know just what it's for: the EOS R is a mirrorless body for Canon users to buy, so that they don't buy Sonys. This is the big factor. Canon users have been trying Sony A7s with adapters, and liking them. Some keep it as an accessory, but some sell their Canon gear and move to Sony. Canon needs that to stop, and their first reaction to this situation is the EOS R.  Canon's introducing one body and four lenses, two of them quite expensive, but still, that's not a full system for nearly anyone who needs a system camera. It's a start. But if you're already a Canon shooter, the R is with an adapter is going to let you try out mirrorless with all of your glass \\u2014 even EF-S lenses, but EF-M lenses are impossible \\u2014 your existing batteries and flash units, etc. It's a much simpler way to experiment with mirrorless for today's Canon shooter. If you're new to ILCs and want full-frame mirrorless, EOS R won't be a great option for at least 3\\u20135 years, depending on how quickly Canon rolls out new glass.  So you're supposed to compare the EOS R to a Sony A7 Mark III, but the closest match is actually the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV. So you're getting more or less a mirrorless 5D Mark IV with some improvements/extra features for $900 less. That's a pretty fine deal, speaking from the Canon universe. It's a bit more expensive than the A7 Mark III, but no one's more aggressive on body pricing than Sony.  I think it succeeds in its mission. If I still had my Canon system and was ready for full frame mirrorless, the EOS R is a no-brainer versus the Sony. It's not even the cost of the bodies or the minute details of the features, but the fact it's already part of my system. The cheap lens adapter is only $100, and it works perfectly. For a bit more, I could get the adapter with filter holder, simply brilliant for video work.  Video Issues  Alas, on that latter one, Canon's still being Canon, and not in a good way. They're still crippling 4K video on the EOS R, delivering the same 1.7x crop you have on the EOS 5D mark IV. If you're buying a full-frame DSLR for video, the point is to have full frame video. With that crop, you're better off going to a Panasonic GH5 or a Blackmagic Design Pocket Cinema Camera 4K, depending on your needs.  I expect for most stills work, you have a 5D Mark IV as far as the quality goes. You won't quite match Sony in very low light, but you'll have a bit more resolution in bright light, so it's probably not a big deal for most photographers. You'll have the Canon color, which Sony has yet to match, and the Canon menus you're used to\\u2026 well, maybe. They have a few new controls on the camera, which changes around the way its used. There's a programmable ring control on lenses, but you won't run into that with adapted EF lenses unless you get the third adapter, the one with the ring control. There's also a touch strip on the back, which most reviewers aren't yet crazy about.  Neither Sony nor Canon has 10-bit in-camera video, which is what you need for serious Log shooting. But the EOS R does have that as an external option, at least. I'd bet on Sony's A7S Mark III offering 10-bit in some fashion, but like Canon, Sony's got their own cinema camera business they feel compelled to protect by crippling the mirrorless models. Oddly, though, Nikon opted for the same thing, in-camera 8-bit, external 10-bit, even without a video market to protect. I guess that leaves them both with a feature to add to a higher end model, next year. Or save money and buy the GH5 right now.  Conclusions  So basically, I think the EOS R is attractive to anyone with a full Canon system thinking about mirrorless. If Canon's annoying behaviors haven't driven you away yet, this may well be your mirrorless. I don't really find any huge problems with it. Knowing that Sony was the initial target, nothing about the EOS R or the Nikon Zs were particularly unexpected. Both aim for the Sony's, Nikon at both the A7III and the A7RIII, Canon's basically doing the A7III competitor now. I would hope they're holding off an A7RIII competitor until they have some improved sensor tech, probably also going into the EOS 5DS Mark II."}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/Can-I-use-a-Canon-EOS-lens-with-a-Nikon-DSLR-camera", "question": "Can I use a Canon EOS lens with a Nikon DSLR camera", "answers": [{"upvote": 4, "content": "Nikon has the longest flange to focal-plane distance, so you can't use lenses meant for other 35mm lens-mounts on Nikon cameras (the lens would be too far from the sensor/film to focus to infinity). The exception might be if you were doing closeup/macro photography and didn't care about infinity focus. There are some medium-format lenses that can be adapted for use on Nikon cameras, though. Canon has one of the shorter flange to focal-plane distances, so lenses for other mounts can more easily be adapted to Canon EOS (even with the extra spacing of the adapter in place, the lens is still close enough to the sensor/film to focus on infinity). Adapting Nikon lenses to use on Canon cameras is a pretty common thing to do. For instance, lots of Canon shooters use adapters with Nikon's wide-angle lenses, which are particularly well-regarded. One note about adapting Nikon lenses for use on Canon bodies. You'll either want to get the older lenses that have a physical aperture ring; or you'll need to get a special \\\"G\\\" adapter that allows you to set the shooting aperture on Nikon's 'G' lenses that have no physical aperture ring. Also, there's no adapter I know of that will work with Nikon's new PC-E lenses, since they have a completely different aperture control mechanism (currently only the three tilt/shift lenses are PC-E, though). Another consideration is that adapted lenses are going to be completely manual-focus, and you may also lose in-camera metering (best you can hope for is probably spot- or center-weighted metering in manual exposure mode, maybe aperture mode if you're really lucky). So unless you have a specific reason for wanting to use a specific lens, it's probably not worth the trouble. I wouldn't recommend getting an adapter just so you can share lenses with friends. If all your friends shoot Canon and you want to be able to share lenses, you should go with a Canon DSLR."}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "Nope you cannot use the Canon Lens on Nikon SLR's because the fit of the lenses would be a bit different i guess but u can use it with a little help of buying Adapter.  Mixing camera and lens brands often sparks quite a debate among photography enthusiasts. While die hard fans of a specific photographic manufacturer, such as Nikon or Canon, swear by their favorite brand and only use products manufactured by that company, the more liberal photography enthusiasts understand that trying out a camera or lens from a different manufacturer, or even mixing pieces from two different manufacturers is acceptable and can result in some beautiful photos. Although Canon lenses do not fit on Nikon cameras without a little help, it is definitely possible to use your Canon lenses with your Nikon camera bodies.  Types of Nikon Cameras  Nikon manufactures two main types of cameras: Digital cameras and digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras. While both are technically digital, the DSLR is a higher-end type of camera that is compatible with a wide range of external zoom lenses. Because you can use such a wide range of lenses with a DSLR camera, they are perfect for professional and amateur photographers who like to experiment with macro and wide-angle photography, and everything in-between.  In contrast, point-and-shoot cameras have built-in lenses that you cannot switch out. Though some people like the convenience of this style, especially for everyday use, these cameras lack the versatility that DSLR cameras offer. Because you cannot switch out the lenses on this type of digital camera, you cannot use Canon lenses with point-and-shoot Nikon cameras.  Types of Canon Lenses  Canon manufactures a wide range of lenses to meet the needs of all types of photographers. Although Canon designs these lenses to fit onto Canon cameras, you can use your Canon lenses with other types of cameras with the help of an additional piece of equipment.  Canon Lens Type Benefits  Prime Lens  Simple photo capture; each lens offers a fixed focal length  Super-zoom  Covers the widest range of focal lengths in one lens  Telephoto  Provides close-ups, even when you are far away; focal lengths fall between 70mm and 200mm  Super-telephoto  Perfect for photographing subjects at great distances; focal lengths greater than 200mm  Specialty lenses  Create unique effects  If you plan to purchase a new Canon lens, you may want to take a look at the different types of lenses available to decide which ones best suit your needs. Keep in mind that there are several different lenses in each category and that each offers a different range of focal lengths as well as varying levels of quality.  Choosing Between a Prime and Zoom Lens  Another important factor to consider when selecting Canon lenses is whether to use a prime lens or a zoom lens. A prime lens offers one specific focal length, rather than a range of focal lengths. This means that in order to make your subject appear closer, you must move toward the subject and to make it look farther away you must step back. You may be asking yourself why you would want a lens with only one focal length when you can have one with a wide range. The reason you might want to purchase a prime lens is that prime lenses are cheaper to produce and, therefore, cheaper to buy. If you have a limited budget for your camera equipment, but do not want to sacrifice quality, buying one or more prime lenses may be the better option for you.  While zoom lenses are considerably more expensive than prime lenses of comparable quality, they offer much more flexibility, which is why many photography enthusiasts prefer to use them. When shopping for zoom lenses opt for the highest quality lenses you can afford to get the best possible photos.  Canon to Nikon Lens Adapters  The trick to using a Canon lens on a Nikon camera body is a Canon to Nikon lens adapter . This adapter fits between the lens and the camera and allows the two incompatible pieces to work together. Several companies manufacture these adapters, so they are available in a wide range of price points; however, you may want to keep in mind that the cheaper adapters may not fit your lens or camera, or both, as well as higher-quality versions. Before you make a purchasing decision be sure the adapter is a Canon to Nikon lens adapter, not a Nikon to Canon lens adapter because this adapter is for using a Nikon lens with a Canon camera.  You can find a wide range of Canon to Nikon lens adapters, as well as Canon lenses and Nikon cameras, for sale on eBay. To find the ideal adapter, camera, or lens, simply enter your terms into the search bar and start shopping. Use the filters on the search results page to narrow down your search results and read each listing until you find the perfect product. Purchasing these relatively inexpensive adapters allows you greater freedom with your camera equipment, which is why so many photographers use them. Think about ordering multiple adapters so you do not have to detach the adapter from the lens each time you want to switch to a different Canon lens.   Hope my answer gave you a clarification and the answer what you were looking for.. Cheers :)"}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "Yes, you definitely can use a a canon lens on a Nikon Camera.

After that your lens will work perfectly with your new Nikon camera."}, {"upvote": 93, "content": "Here are my thoughts related to purchasing a dSLR for a beginner or anyone else interested in a serious approach to making the best purchase decision for their needs.  Buying on a budget -  If you believe that you will someday be serious about photography then my suggestion is that you buy either Nikon or Canon and look to having a long-term investment in lenses and a short-term investment in camera backs.  I have a fairly large lens collection and some of my lenses are about 25 years old. Others have been acquired in the last few months. While the lenses might have newer versions the actual lenses I have are still widely sold and are still considered current by the manufacturer. The main point here is that I have spent far more on lenses than on the camera backs (5 or 6) that I purchased over the same period of time.  This scenario is typical of any serious photographer and both Canon and Nikon realize that and tend to avoid making new bodies that would cause photographer's lens collections to become obsolete.  If you can afford lenses made for full sensor cameras I find this a better choice. The lenses will work in a crop sensor camera capturing the image at the lens center where it tends to be sharpest, the build quality is substantially better, and the lenses retain their value while giving you the flexibility to move to a full sensor camera when you want (and retain the crop sensor back as a backup).  So put a package together that is within your means but keep the future in mind. In the long run this will save you considerable money.  Buying a camera that supports the type of photography that you are interested in -  I would start with building a list of what you want to do right now with a digital camera and I'd start with the subject of your photography. For example:  People Travel/Tourist Landscape Sports Night/Low-Light  Then I'd make a list of what my future goal is recognizing that you might have a goal and you might not, i.e., you're just exploring. This is common for beginners so don't think you are alone. Also, remember to give yourself some wiggle-room on your budget... if you can find a camera that meets your needs and it's under your budget then no problem. On the other hand if you need to kick in a few more dollars to get the least expensive camera that meets your needs then consider that as well. There's no point in purchasing a camera that is not capable of doing what you want to do right now.  As you consider your choices review the camera's abilities against your list of current and known future requirements. If you are planning to go with a dSLR you can skip the distant future requirements because any camera you buy will be replaced in 3-4 years as new and improved models are introduced (similar thinking to computer or smart-phone purchases). dSLR lens thinking as previously mentioned is different because your investment in quality lenses has a 20-30 year horizon.  I am a firm believer that you ought to handle the camera before you buy it. The reason is that some cameras use menus to change the settings while others use dials. Different people are comfortable with one system or the other. Generally speaking the more pro-level the camera the more it will use buttons and dials because, once learned, these are very fast compared to menus.  So, don't make a purchase on your first visit to a camera store. Handle the camera there and see what might work for you then go home and get some reviews of the camera to see if it meets your requirements.  One site that I use a lot is DxOMark by DxO Labs (http://www.dxomark.com). They provide objective reviews of camera sensors and lenses and rank these against their ability to meet a creative goal. They do not measure focus system responsiveness or shutter release lag, which can be additional factors in the overall camera system but knowing the measured capabilities of the camera sensor and lens covers much of the camera's basic abilities to fill you needs. What DxOMark does not do very well is provide reviews of cameras from a photographer's perspective. For example, camera features like the camera's ability to follow focus of moving subjects is not covered very well or whether or not the camera controls are intuitive. For this type of review I turn to photographer-oriented sites like The Digital Picture (http://www.the-digital-picture.com).  There's other advice on Quora. Consider reviewing Digital Photography: What are good specifications to look for in a digital camera? and Cameras: What's the best way to buy a DSLR camera?  Do you purchase a mid-range or inexpensive dSLR -  A lot depends on what you want to photograph now and perhaps in the long term and the volume of your photography.  The biggest investment most advanced amateurs and pro photographers have is in their lenses (I repeat this for emphasis). Lenses are bought for specific purposes whether these be for macro, portrait, landscape or sports photography to name a few. I have lenses that are newly purchased and others that I've used for about 25 years. All still work well and all were purchased to meet a particular photographic need.  So, here's my advice. If you are serious about photography and believe your interests will last consider your lenses first and then consider the dSLR body. That being the case, I would avoid lenses that didn't support a full-frame sensor even if the dSLR you are using has a less than full-frame sensor. This way, if you spend good money on a lens you will be able to use it if you upgrade your camera. I'll also note that manufacturers of advanced amateur and pro camera dSLRs seldom change their lens mounts because the lens investment tends to lock the photographer into their camera line (e.g., Canon photographers seldom change to Nikon or vice versa because they need to change-out their lenses).  I started in film and my first camera body was a Canon Rebel (I bought the back only and used my existing lenses). I later changed to a 5D because I liked the full-frame sensor. I then moved to a 5D Mark II because it's capabilities to deal with low-light situations a few years ago was really top notch (I shoot indoor sports and the Mark II it has a higher ISO range). I have since changed to the 1Dx for its still-higher ISO range, improved focus system, and higher frame rate. If I add all these backs together it would not equal my investment in lenses.  If your intention is to move on from a basic model to a more advanced model and you are fairly certain you are going to move up then you might consider separating your camera back purchase from your lens purchase. You could for example purchase a new or used full-frame lens and use it on whichever back you choose. If you have photography friends who would allow you to borrow lenses you might want to purchase a back that supported those lenses giving you an inexpensive way to try different lenses.  Another entry point into a dSLR system is to start with used equipment. I would not recommend forking over a serious amount of coin on a top-end pro camera until you know why you need one or have money to throw away. You can review current and discontinued cameras and lenses on the sites previously mentioned to learn their capabilities both from a photographer's viewpoint and from an analytic viewpoint to see what would best fill your needs.  Sidebar: Earlier photography was all in film. It wasn't unusual for me to have $600 in lab costs to process the film from a single event. From this you can extrapolate that the cost of a digital camera back was easily repaid to high-volume photographers from the avoidance of lab costs (presuming you ignored the cost of the computer system and software to process and store the digital photos). In some ways, digital sensors are superior to film in capturing an image: 1) you can instantly evaluate the image on the camera back and 2) the ISO range is now higher than film. But, film still has some capabilities over digital by having more exposure latitude (very forgiving, especially to over-exposures) and extended highlight range (no digital clipping).  What's the best way to buy a dSLR -  One suggestion I make is that you ought to handle the DSLR before you buy. The reason for this is that the camera needs to fit well to your hand and the controls need to be intuitive. There are other factors in selecting your DSLR that you should also consider (Ref: Digital Photography: What are good specifications to look for in a digital camera?). In short, the camera should be an easy tool for you to use. If it's cumbersome you likely have the wrong model for you (we all organize differently so different models support different groups).  The other thing you should consider is whether or not you want to be able to walk up to someone and ask them a question or resolve a problem you might be having with your DSLR. I happen to live in the Washington, DC area and I recommend a local store, Penn Camera (now Calumet), that happens to match B&H pricing on camera bodies. So, I'll sometimes make my purchase there and, if I have a problem, I hand the camera to them and tell them to fix it.  I have several decades experience with photography and seldom have problems; however, compatibility issues do come up. For example, I have a Canon EOS 5D and a Canon EOS 5D MK-II back. I also have a Quantum flash that I use on occasion to take event photos (weddings, etc). I was doing a practice run for a wedding using the 5D MK-II for the first time with the Quantum flash and found that I couldn't get it to work. I went to Penn Camera and they resolved the problem... the hot shoe connector/cord from Quantum had changed to support the 5D MK-II. I walked out with the new cord and could work the wedding the following day.  So, the local sellers have definite value allowing you to handle the DSLR, give customer support without the mail delay, and some can match on-line sellers (especially if you are informed and have a price target in mind and are willing to negotiate).  I also highly recommend B&H. They have excellent prices, excellent customer support and, unlike some on-line sellers, clearly distinguish Grey Market items from those intended for the US market. I have no problem purchasing from them and do so on a regular basis and also recommend them to others.  [For those unfamiliar with the term, Grey Market items are packaged for other markets, e.g., Eastern Europe, etc., and are essentially the same as US Market items but do not carry a US warranty. So, less expensive but some warranty exposure.]  What are specifications to look for in a dSLR -  First, I'll state that megapixels are sometimes more a marketing ploy than a mark of quality. Dense pixels on a small sensor tend to be much more limited than less-dense pixels on a larger sensor. Do not gauge the quality of a camera by megapixels alone.  That aside, the every camera consists of a few elements:  Body - Houses the controls and electronics Lens - Gathers the light to send to the sensor Sensor - Collects the gathered light Electronics - Translates and stores the image from the sensor.  Here are some of the qualities you might look for in each of the above:  Body  Does the body fit well in your hand? How heavy or large is the body? Are the controls intuitive and easy to use? Is the body sufficiently rugged? [Depends on use: Indoor, Outdoor, War Zone, etc.] Is the body sufficiently water resistant? [Depends on use: Indoor, Outdoor, Under Water, etc.] Does the camera have a viewfinder, display a \\\"live image\\\", or both?  Lens  If the camera has a fixed lens, will it meet your needs in terms of range (Zoom: Wide, Normal, Tele), Focus (Macro and distant), and Speed (Aperture size)? What is the extent of the optical zoom? [Digital zoom is cropping the image to make it bigger but less dense in pixels. If you're using a computer to edit your images, digital zoom does nothing for you since you can crop in your editing software.]  If the camera is an SLR or hybrid that has interchangeable lenses, does that system of lenses support your needs as above? [with higher-end SLR systems it almost certainly will, with some of the hybrids where lens selection is more limited, so perhaps or perhaps not] If you have a particular need, ensure that it is covered.  If I already have lenses, will my lenses work? If so, will they work the same way or will the image be magnified?  If you are buying lenses consider the advantages of prime and zoom lens types. Generally speaking, prime lenses are sharper and lighter and less expensive. Zoom lenses are more versatile in distance when you compose your shots.  Sensor - This is a complex subject consisting of several sensor qualities that interact to capture an image:  ISO Sensitivity Signal to Noise Ratio Dynamic Range Tonal Range Color Sensitivity  Portraits are sensitive to Tonal Range (lots of subtle tones in skin). Landscape photography is sensitive to Dynamic Range (lots of lights and darks in landscape). Sports as well as concerts and indoor photography using natural light is sensitive to ISO Sensitivity and Signal to Noise Ratios. Color Sensitivity plays a role throughout since this is a measure of color accuracy. An excellent non-manufacturer source of sensor testing in the above categories is www.DxOMark.com.  Electronics  Does the camera's range of Shutter Speeds meet your needs? Does the camera's ability to synchronize the shutter to the flash meet your needs? How quickly will the camera focus? Can you focus manually if you need to? Will the camera focus follow an object in motion and if so, how well? Will the camera allow you to take multiple frames by holding the shutter release down? If so, how many frames per second does the camera support? Does the camera support video or just still photography? Will the camera autofocus during video or only at the beginning of the video? Does the camera support RAW format as well as JPEG (compressed) format? What type of media does the camera use to store images? If I do my own printing, can I print direct from the camera or do I need a computer to print? Do I have a computer? Can I operate the camera in a totally manual way for creative control? If so, are the controls easy to use (also associate this question with the body since that's where the controls are located as buttons, knobs or a display menu system)?  Generally the starting point is deciding what you want to do with the camera. For everyday snapshots many if not most cameras will fit the bill. As soon as you go in any direction that tests or exceeds the range of a snapshot camera you'll want to build a list of what you want to do before you select the camera to do it with. Typical examples: Low light/natural light indoor photography, sport photography, landscape photography, studio portraits, macro photography (flowers, insects or anything really close-up), underwater photography, et ceteras. Shop first by those attributes.  Once you gain a range of cameras that suit your needs, look at megapixels to gauge the size of the picture you want to print. Printers tend to print in the range of 250-360 ppi. At 360 ppi your looking at 129,600 pixels per square inch of print area at the highest print quality. Figure what size you will generally print and you can estimate the number of megapixels your camera will need to capture. Getting more megapixels in the image than you need can be useful for cropping or enlarging certain areas of the captured image (perhaps to extend the range of your lens) as with a digital zoom."}, {"upvote": 235, "content": "Why are Nikon and Canon giving up on DSLR camera? The bottom line: it's because customers are giving up on DSLR cameras. More specifically, they're moving on mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras.  In 2008, Panasonic introduced the first modern mirrorless ILC, the Lumix G1 (Micro Four Thirds). This was followed up by Olympus in 2009 (Micro Four Thirds), Sony in 2010 (E-Mount), Nikon in 2011 (Nikon 1 System), Pentax in 2011 (Q Mount), Fujifilm in 2012 (X-Mount), Canon in 2012 (EOS M System), and Leica in 2014 (T-Mount/L-Mount).  Over this time period, the only mainstream DSLR companies were Canon, Nikon, Sony, and Pentax. It's interesting to note that Canon's EOS M, Nikon's System 1, and Pentax's Q-Mount were all pure consumer models. They were specifically designed to not complete with DSLRs. Sony's E-Mount was not being positioned against DSLRs in the early days, but it wasn't crippled. So a funny thing happened:   * Sony offered the semi-professional A7 full frame E-Mount camera series in 2013, followed by the pro-grade A9 in 2017. In 2021, Sony ended their A-Mount line of DSLRs.  * The Nikon 1 System was ended in 2018. Also in 2018, Nikon introduced their Z-Mount, which was sold as a major improvement over their DSLR F-Mount from 1959. They discontinued their D3500 and D5600 DSLRs this year, their consumer offerings, as well as the D500, their pro-grade APS-C model. That's 1/3 of their DSLR line. Rumors have suggested they are doing no new DSLR development, but the company has not confirmed this.  * Canon introduced the EOS R system and RF mount also in 2018. They have yet to cancel the EOS M System, but there's a strong belief they will. They did not kill the DSLR yet, but they did announce that the EOS 1D Mark III is their last flagship-level camera. They announced that no new EF lenses were in the works, and they stopped production on most EF lenses.  * The last Pentax Q System camera was introduced in 2014. They have no mirrorless products or announced plans. It's pretty clear that the camera market is shifting from DSLRs to MILCs. For me, anyway, once the EVF got good enough, I was sold on the advantages of mirrorless. For me, that was 2015. Some folks are late to the game.  Today, Nikon is making about 50% of their income from their Z-Mount MILC System and 30% from the F-Mount DSLR System. However, their own projections put the F-Mount sales at 3% by 2025, while mirrorless will constitute 82%. Here are all of Nikon's current DSLRs, and I have two observations. First, Nikon likes the investment in a DSLR body to pay off over enough time to make it worthwhile. If they're expecting to see sales drop to next-to-nothing over the next three years, it makes no economic sense to introduce a new model.  The second thing is that, watching the history of DSLR and MILC systems, I have a general observation: the market tends to know a camera system is dead before the manufacturer makes any final announcement. A defining characteristic of a living system is new gear being designed and released. If your system hasn't seen a new introduction in about three years, there's a pretty good chance the manufacturer has written it off but isn't quite ready to announce that fact.  Finally, Nikon and Canon were late to the professional mirrorless race. I suspect they were in denial for awhile, believing that the DSLR market was sustainable in the face of increasingly advanced MILCs. Despite serious offerings from Olympus, Panasonic, Leica, and Fujifilm, it probably took Sony's A7 line to convince the big two of the advantages of mirrorless. Particularly as Sony started to make it a three-way race, and got their autofocus good, then great, and started doing things with it that don't work well, or at all, on a DSLR. As well, Panasonic had demonstrated that mirrorless was a big advantage for still cameras doing video, and OMDS/Olympus added a bunch of features (ProCapture, Focus Stacking, the Live computational functions, Starry Sky Autofocus, etc) that don't really play on a DSLR unless you lock up the mirror.  Pentax simply can't afford to jump to a new mirrorless mount, but Nikon and Canon could. But they could not afford to be distracted by a fading DSLR market. They both went all-in on MILCs. I'm not sure, in 2018, when they both started emphasizing MILC and scaling back DSLR plans, that either knew it was a permanent shift. After all, that's really up to the customers. And the customers have spoken: most want MILCs.  The other thing to note is that today, in mid-2022, Nikon's Z System is complete enough to attract new users who will never own an F-Mount lens and a lens converter. They have their flagship MILC, the Nikon Z9, which is fantastically innovative, capable as any professional DSLR, and so sought after there's a 6\\u20139 month wait for one. Canon doesn't have a true flagship out yet, but it's not a secret that they're working on an R1, perhaps out in 2023. Neither company needs their DSLR line to allow them to compete with Sony and other MILC companies.  The only DSLR introduced in 2021 was the Pentax K-3 Mark III. No new DSLRs were introduced in 2022. Unless Nikon or Canon introduce a new body very soon, everyone is going to believe the DSLR is dead, even if they like them. No one wants to buy into a dead system.  One word on Pentax, as the lone DSLR supporter these days. For quite some time, Pentax has successfully added features that have otherwise been only found on mirrorless cameras. They were an early adopter of IBIS, they're so far the only ones with an Astrotracer function (the sensor, essentially, stabilizes the shot against the turning of planet earth, very cool), high resolution shots, etc. Maybe the remaining DSLR purists switch to Pentax? It would be very nice to see one DSLR system remain viable, and it seems Ricoh, Pentax's parent company, is running Pentax more like a hobby than a business\\u2026 a thing Olympus was accused of before they split their imaging division off as OM Digital Systems.

Set your lens aperture at the minimum to achieve maximum effect. 2.  1. You may compensate the additional brightness by reducing ISO to 100 or 50 (whatever tour decide supports) and / or increasing the shutter speed to limit the amount of light hitting the sensor.  3. Try to bring your subject closer to you as much as you can (physically from the lens). Additionally you should have significant distance between your subject and background. As; if the background is very close to the subject, it will be having almost the same focus as that of the subject (which you should avoid).  1. Use the blurring lenses like prime lens with low f number (larger aperture). The other option is a telephoto lens which might be a lot costlier though. Apart from the runtime techniques; you may use Photoshop, photo-scape or similar software to give the blur digitally.

Use large aperture lens having f/1.4 , f/1.8, f/2.8 or even f/4 lens will do that, if not follow the point no 1, since DSLR will give you that nice blur anyways and can be enhanced further by adding distance between your subject and its distance to background. 3.

And I think they made some good decisions, and a few bad ones that may have not been choices as much as technical limitations.  Neither Canon nor Nikon were actually new to mirrorless with last August's introductions. But the R and the Z are professional formats, even if the first models are not a match for the top-of-the-line DSLRs yet. Both Canon and Nikon took on the idea that mirrorless was something less than DSLR, a step between DSLR and compact digital cameras (aka point and shoot). Nikon's 1 system used the same 1\\u2033 sensor size found in high-end P&S cameras like the Sony RX10 and RX100. But Canon put out a very compact APS-C system with their EOS M. And a funny thing happened: while Nikon's 1 system is now defunct, the EOS M is very popular, albeit not necessarily in the USA. Canon's been the #2 mirrorless brand in Japan in 2016 and 2017 (BCN rankings, second to Olympus) and looks to be taking the #1 spot for the 2018 year\\u2026 without even counting the EOS R. Canon seems to have nailed the consumer mirrorless ILC with the EOS M.  So it should be no surprise that Canon got into mirrorless on a higher level with the EOS R, but then again, it should be. Canon is slower to react to competition than just about anyone. Why this, why now? Canon feels the competition.  For most of history since maybe the 1940s or 1950s, Canon and Nikon had much of the professional market for cameras. In the 1960s, led by Nikon, they won an 80% share, and it's been pretty much 80\\u201390% ever since. Canon managed to flip the market share on Nikon by being the first to court consumers, and then by delivering the fastest speeds for pro sports shooters. But for a long time, the only 35mm, then full-frame choice for most pros was Nikon or Canon.  This last year, the whole industry sold only 11.6 million ILCs, less than half of those sold in 2013. And 2017 was actually an 8% increase from 2016. But more the point, DSLRs sold only accounted for 65% of the ILC market\\u2026 clearly, Nikon and Canon were no longer winning an 80\\u201390% share. And while Canon's mirrorless sales were up 70% in 2017, Nikon wasn't even part of that. And of course, neither was competitive with Sony, Olympus, Panasonic, or Fujifilm in higher-end mirrorless. No one knows just where the DSLR vs. mirrorless ratio settles out in the long term, but it's not going to be terribly favorable to any company only making DSLRs.  What's It For?  If you look carefully at the EOS R, like the Nikon Z's, you'll know just what it's for: the EOS R is a mirrorless body for Canon users to buy, so that they don't buy Sonys. This is the big factor. Canon users have been trying Sony A7s with adapters, and liking them. Some keep it as an accessory, but some sell their Canon gear and move to Sony. Canon needs that to stop, and their first reaction to this situation is the EOS R.  Canon's introducing one body and four lenses, two of them quite expensive, but still, that's not a full system for nearly anyone who needs a system camera. It's a start. But if you're already a Canon shooter, the R is with an adapter is going to let you try out mirrorless with all of your glass \\u2014 even EF-S lenses, but EF-M lenses are impossible \\u2014 your existing batteries and flash units, etc. It's a much simpler way to experiment with mirrorless for today's Canon shooter. If you're new to ILCs and want full-frame mirrorless, EOS R won't be a great option for at least 3\\u20135 years, depending on how quickly Canon rolls out new glass.  So you're supposed to compare the EOS R to a Sony A7 Mark III, but the closest match is actually the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV. So you're getting more or less a mirrorless 5D Mark IV with some improvements/extra features for $900 less. That's a pretty fine deal, speaking from the Canon universe. It's a bit more expensive than the A7 Mark III, but no one's more aggressive on body pricing than Sony.  I think it succeeds in its mission. If I still had my Canon system and was ready for full frame mirrorless, the EOS R is a no-brainer versus the Sony. It's not even the cost of the bodies or the minute details of the features, but the fact it's already part of my system. The cheap lens adapter is only $100, and it works perfectly. For a bit more, I could get the adapter with filter holder, simply brilliant for video work.  Video Issues  Alas, on that latter one, Canon's still being Canon, and not in a good way. They're still crippling 4K video on the EOS R, delivering the same 1.7x crop you have on the EOS 5D mark IV. If you're buying a full-frame DSLR for video, the point is to have full frame video. With that crop, you're better off going to a Panasonic GH5 or a Blackmagic Design Pocket Cinema Camera 4K, depending on your needs.  I expect for most stills work, you have a 5D Mark IV as far as the quality goes. You won't quite match Sony in very low light, but you'll have a bit more resolution in bright light, so it's probably not a big deal for most photographers. You'll have the Canon color, which Sony has yet to match, and the Canon menus you're used to\\u2026 well, maybe. They have a few new controls on the camera, which changes around the way its used. There's a programmable ring control on lenses, but you won't run into that with adapted EF lenses unless you get the third adapter, the one with the ring control. There's also a touch strip on the back, which most reviewers aren't yet crazy about.  Neither Sony nor Canon has 10-bit in-camera video, which is what you need for serious Log shooting. But the EOS R does have that as an external option, at least. I'd bet on Sony's A7S Mark III offering 10-bit in some fashion, but like Canon, Sony's got their own cinema camera business they feel compelled to protect by crippling the mirrorless models. Oddly, though, Nikon opted for the same thing, in-camera 8-bit, external 10-bit, even without a video market to protect. I guess that leaves them both with a feature to add to a higher end model, next year. Or save money and buy the GH5 right now.  Conclusions  So basically, I think the EOS R is attractive to anyone with a full Canon system thinking about mirrorless. If Canon's annoying behaviors haven't driven you away yet, this may well be your mirrorless. I don't really find any huge problems with it. Knowing that Sony was the initial target, nothing about the EOS R or the Nikon Zs were particularly unexpected. Both aim for the Sony's, Nikon at both the A7III and the A7RIII, Canon's basically doing the A7III competitor now. I would hope they're holding off an A7RIII competitor until they have some improved sensor tech, probably also going into the EOS 5DS Mark II."}, {"upvote": 15, "content": "Is Canon EOS RP Worth buying?

Now the question is why do people say that this camera has poor specs? Because people only focus on specs and not on what they can do with the camera. I have seen about 99% of the time camera is better than the photographer who uses it. Several decades ago when I was starting out with manual focus SLRs, I was hoping that a better camera will help me overcome my deficiencies. Alas, that's what all photographers think ie. they need a camera which can magically make them better without they learning to become great.  People may say this camera has got still photo shooting burst rate of 5 frames per second. I use a Canon EOS 1DXII which is canon's top of the line still photography camera. However, I rarely use 12fps burst. I shoot a max of 2\\u20133 frames at a time. If you know what you are doing, then you don't need to adopt the spray and pray mode ie keep on pushing the shutter button and hoping that one shot will be great.  If I have to do street shooting or kind of mountain climbing then this kind of small and light body will help.  Every camera company has to differentiate their offerings and keep some of the top notch specs for their high end bodies. Else, why will anyone buy a high end body? If you can extract every drop of juice from this body, then you can become a great photographer and then obviously you can buy the other expensive cameras. Till then do with this."}, {"upvote": 24, "content": "No, not all."}, {"upvote": 6, "content": "Having used or owned a majority of Canon DSLRs over the last year, starting with the t1i, and eventually making my way up to the 5D Mark III, with many other stops along the way, I have always stuck with the 5D Mark III, as the all round workhorse.   Budgets differ from person to person, I can't exactly tell you which one to get, but I will tell you out of my experience with shooting with these cameras which works best for what.  Let's start off looking at a few things.   Look and Feel of: APS-C vs Full Frame I commonly switch between my Mark III and 60D depending on a certain look and feel that I want for the photo. I general I would always recommend using a full-frame camera, but if I'm shooting in optimal lighting conditions, there's something about the APS-C sensors that I love. I can't put my finger on it exactly. The closest comparison I have to how I feel about APS-C vs Full Frame sensor is like watching a movie in 24 frames vs 60 frames. There's different appeals to each look and feel. (I recently came back from vacation where I used my 60D for the first time in a long time and I fell in-love with the look and feel of the pictures, I posted a bunch on my blog Cayo Coco Jeep Safari Tour - Cuba Adventures | legion X studios [ http://www.legionxstudios.com/blog/cayo-coco-jeep-safari-tour-cuba-adventures-part-1 ]  Winner: Tie (leaning towards APS-C)  Noise Performance: APS-C vs Full Frame I you plan to shoot indoors, or at night, the sensor size will make a world of difference. Full-frame cameras are a world apart from APS-C sensor cameras, and without doubt is a need.  Winner: Full-frame  Video Performance: APS-C vs Full Frame  If video is important to you, this is something to consider. Much like noise performance comparison, video performance is highly judged by its cleanness. The better noise performance in full-frame cameras make for better video capabilities.  Winner: Full-frame  I could compare other parts of the camera, and in most cases I thought for simplicity, these 3 were fine to illustrate my next point. I will not recommend buying an APS-C unless those are the only cameras within your budget. In that case starting even small with the 70D.  The first logical upgrade after that is the 6D, I would skip over the 7D and 7D mark II.  And after that I would only go as high as the 5D Mark III, unless you're made of money, and by all means the 1dx and 1dxc are both brilliant cameras.  I would also skip over the 5D R and 5D S. These cameras are super specialty, and they are intended for studio work. They have poor low light performance, and should only be used in ideal shooting conditions, such as a studio. Their 50MP sensor is made for big print ads.   Important part: This I think is the most common dilemma with a lot of shooters who take photography seriously, and want a full-frame, but can't afford the 1dx. Really it come down to the 6D vs 5D Mark III. Having used both, I can say the following. If photography is your only interest and don't care about video, get the 6D. In the 6D they removed the anti-aliasing filter, which is important to have in video mode. The removal of this filter allows the 6D to take much sharper pictures than then 5D Mark III, in a side by side comparison. If you are interested in the video capabilities, hands down must go for the 5D Mark III."}, {"upvote": 2, "content": "Looks like an excellent camera to me, for what it's intended to be.  The RF lens mount is the launchpad for Canon to combine their lens building prowess with the physical benefits of a mirrorless mount, and their first 10 lenses are all excellent within their class and already confirm many of the promises of the mount.  But lenses need a body to work on, and the RP is an entry level model to provide that, to encourage beginners or those with a limited budget into the RF mount. Bodies tend to be more transient than lenses, especially the entry level ones, and creating a good entry level body is about balancing the right combination of features, performance and price.  The RP's standout feature is simply that it's an affordable RF mount camera with excellent ergonomics.  As DPReview noted:   %3E While other manufacturers are moving ever further up-market with more expensive and capable devices, the EOS RP stands alone in providing more novice or budget-constrained users with access to the shallower depth-of-field that full frame cameras offer over those with APS-C or smaller sensors. It's also a comparatively small and lightweight full frame camera, designed for easy stowage (internal strap-lugs and a low rounded profile to greatly reduced snagging points). Combined with the lower price, this makes it and excellent option for a full frame travel camera.  Canon achieved this by limiting the features set and using older technology, essentially reusing the sensor from the 2017 EOS 6D Mk II with an updated processor.  This means the camera won't, be winning any geek-tech awards for its technical spec sheet, especially if 4k video is a priority (and if is you're likely either gullible or a working professional who has determined it so).  However, it's a highly competent camera and there's nothing to prevent its user winning any number of actual photography awards using the images this camera could produce when used well."}, {"upvote": 8, "content": "One of these photos was taken with a brand new 5D mark IV.

The 6D mk II is a full frame camera and the 90D is a crop sensor camera. They have the same autofocus system (45 point dual-pixel). The 90D has a higher burst rate (10 frames/sec vs 6.5).

A better camera will not make you a better photographer. All new gear does is give you new or improved capabilities. What you do with those capabilities, or if you use them at all, is up to you.

I don't need any of the new capabilities that the R5 offers. IBIS doesn't really matter for me because I'm mostly shooting with strobes in the studio. Even when I'm shooting outdoors, I rarely have issues getting handheld shots. I don't need 8K video. The improved autofocus and higher ISO range would be a nice-to-have, but it's not a need. 45MP might help a little when making poster size prints, but probably not enough to justify the price. Bottom line, what I have gets the job done. For me, there's no return on investment for upgrading.  But that's just me, and my needs.

Canon, even though one of the oldest player took a lot of time to implement mirrorless and IBIS. 2. Sony on the other hand came in like a storm with their Alpha series when Canon 5D series was ruling the market. 3. What canon did over a decade, Sony was able to pull out magic in just couple of years. 4. Canon has never considered a good 4K slow-mo on their cameras & crop on the sensor when you bump frame rates is such a turnoff. On the other hand Sony has brilliant slow-mo. 5. Also Canon has come up with their new lens range for R Series camera. It will set you back a lot of money as the red rings are amazing but expensive. 6. Canon cameras perform extremely well with Canon glass. But Sony overall does a decent job with third party lens. Undoubtably Canon wins this one. L series lens with Canon body is any day better than Sony glass on Sony body. (Sony is slowly catching up there for sure). 7. DYNAMIC RANGE & LOW LIGHT - I cannot stress enough on these 2 factors. Canon is definitely amazing in these 2 categories. Sony is notches ahead of Canon. A7S2 can literally see in pitch dark situations. (Sorry Canon, but - Sony) Overall Verdict:  I am still a canon shooter and will forever love what Canon did in the initial days. But now the competition is cutthroat and Canon needs to pace up. EOS R5 is one such attempt. But, with Blackmagic providing 6K RAW (with editing solutions out of the box) for 2500$ and all the camera enthusiasts awaiting Sony's A7S3 launch. It might just not be the right time yet to invest in Canon EOS R5. If I were you I would wait for Sony's launch (which I am sure is coming sooner than later) and later decide upon the pick. If Sony disappoints, I would strongly vouch for Blackmagic PCC6K as for the price tag, it is just way too delicious.  P.S: I am still a canon shooter (Canon 5DM4).

I'll been needing to live with it for a good year :-)  I'm actually really happy to see the Canon EOS R5. I left Canon back in 2018, mostly because I was getting more out of my Olympus gear. I grokked the whole mirrorless thing, found it better than optical. I could actually use my old manual lenses much more effectively than on an DSLR.  But part of it was their basic attitude. Kasey Stern, the genius behind the Camera Conspiracies vlog, pretty much expressed my main problem with Canon. It was absolutely clear, over the years, that Canon was arbitrarily holding back the level of technology on lower-end cameras to sell higher-end cameras\\u2026 regardless of the actual cost of those features. If you're the only camera company in the world and doing that, maybe that's okay. But they were not\\u2026. there are other camera companies.  So in 2015, I had bought a few Olympus Micro Four Thirds cameras, which I was using as a secondary system\\u2026 for when I didn't want to drag along my 10kg+ Canon system. I bought the OM-D E-M5 Mark II that year. First thing to note was that, even thought this was a mid-range camera, they didn't reduce features in any way that wasn't an obvious additional expense. In fact, they introduced a bunch of new features on this model that the flagship OM-D E-M1 didn't do. A year later, they introduced a new flagship, the OM-D E-M1 Mark II, with a bunch of new features. Not long after, they put out an update that added some of those new features \\u2014 those that would reasonably work \\u2014 for my E-M5 Mark II.   Canon, on the other hand, intentionally crippled their lower-end models to drive higher-end sales. And perhaps, in a different way, they also kind of decided, for the photographer, various limits of the camera that were not necessarily natural. Their old behavior was to cripple a bunch of things. So I had a Canon 60D and added a 6D. The 60D, a much lower cost camera, had a far, far better autofocus system. They could have put something at least that good into the 6D for very little extra money, but they were more concerned about the 6D/5D competition than Nikon or anyone else competing with their offerings.  This was all through the camera, including a bunch of things that were 100% software-bases, just there to crapify the 6D versus the 5D. When you're invested in any system \\u2014 camera or otherwise \\u2014 you have a vested interest. And if you're an internet writer or pundit, your first impulse is to support and defend the things your excellent brain has found to be the best. Unfortunately, as a full-time engineer and only hobby photographer, it was all too easy for me to see how that cripple hammer had been applied. And once you get involved with a company that doesn't do that, even a little bit; a company that's actually adding new high-end features to your mid-range camera, you have a hard time sticking with the old guys.  So I was really excited to see the EOS R5. Of course, since I have not used this camera, I had to give you all my ideas here rather than a real review. But also, I'm hoping this goes beyond the R5 and changes the way Canon is thinking. I knew Canon had some technology issues\\u2026 here, they've solved that a bit, but they're also leaving it up to the user how they'd like to deal with camera limitations. As a result, you have limited features not offered by anyone else.   I noticed back in 2018 how Canon was going about their EOS R business. They introduced the original EOS R as a low-cost mirrorless, relative to the EOS 5D Mark IV, that had the same sensor and, ideally, same image quality. But they crippled it a bit, to ensure it wasn't quite a pro-grade match to the 5D. And yet, that also made it cheaper.  So get inside Canon's head for a moment. The EOS R was not all that well received, but I got the idea right away. Sony was drinking Canon's milkshake as photographers and videographers started to really get the idea of mirrorless camera advantages. When they introduced the R, they introduced three different EF to RF adapters. So any old Canon shooter could buy an EOS R, a lens adapter, and pretty much pretend they had a mirrorless Canon EF camera. The key here: you could buy a Sony, buy a Metabones adapter, but you still have a Sony\\u2026 it doesn't work as fast with your EF lenses, it doesn't use your batteries, it doesn't use your speedlights. So Canon was wise: the EOS R's only purpose was to stop the bleeding.  Next thing was glass. The reason Canon and Nikon had 80\\u201390% of the pro SLR and DSLR market for 50 years was that they had huge collections of lenses. As nice as a new camera might be, if you can't get the lens you need, fuggetaboudit! And yet, Canon offered those three adapters\\u2026. no worries.  No worries unless, like Canon, you're trying to launch a new system. Nikon went there\\u2026 Nikon didn't do all that well with the Z system, despite making excellent gear. My contention was simple: you can't make a new system for new users if you're Canon or Nikon. As with the EOS R, you make a camera that's kind of a no-brainer for existing users.  But here's the thing: let's assume I still have my EOS 6D. I go and buy an EOS R, I buy the basic adapter, and I'm golden, right\\u2026 I have a mirrorless Canon EF camera. I'm good, but Canon isn't\\u2026 they'd rather me be an EOS EF user than a Sony user, but what they'd really like is for me to be an EOS R user, cemented in place. That only happens if my next lens buys are RF lenses, not EF lenses, despite the fact they can't work on my other cameras.  So Canon did another cool thing: rather than try to flesh out their RF lens line with the basic set of EF clones they'd need to sell EOS R system cameras, they made hero lenses. The first RF lenses were insanely good lenses. So were the next few. This was brilliant \\u2014 anyone buying that one EOS R body was potentially sucked in for those lenses. This was absolutely an unusual move: Canon was delivering lenses that average folks couldn't afford, but they were selling dreams to their professional user base.   So even without having an R5 in my hands, I know enough about it to know that this completes the circle. This is the pro body that everyone who flirted with EOS R \\u2014 pretty much all pros and well-heeled enthusiasts \\u2014 wanted. And more.  Canon launched the video on a DSLR thing with the Canon 5D Mark II. Okay, sure, Nikon got there a few months before with 720; video, but Canon really sold it. And I think a big part of that, early on, as Vincent Laforet's 5D Mark II short film Reverie\\u2026 anyone who used digital camera for video back then simply knew this film was impossible. But after the 5D Mark II \\u2014 half of which were sold for video use \\u2014 Canon lost steam in the DSLR-for-video market. Why? Well, heck, Canon has been one of the Big Four in camcorders\\u2026 so they built Cinema EOS, a line of much more expensive cinema cameras that used regular EF lenses. And so regular EOS product line cameras had to get the cripple hammer.. you wouldn't want someone buying a $750, $1500, or $3000 camera that fits their needs if maybe you can sell 10% of those buyers on a $10,000+ camera that does it all\\u2026. at least, that seemed to be the logic.   So now the R5 is kind of a return to the 5D Mark II\\u2026 no artificial limitations, far as I can tell. And even IBIS \\u2014 Canon's the last one to the party on that, and I'm a bit skeptical that they can match Olympus on their first try, but I've found it critical for my own shooting.

Let me give you this piece of advice: your camera is the least important thing in your camera bag. Lenses and lighting are far more important, and by far the most important piece of gear is the one between your ears. Invest your money accordingly.  A 5DS r is going for $3,700 new. An EOS R is going for $2000 for just the body. So I'm going to say your total budget is around $4500. A good rule of thumb is to spend 30% of your budget on the body and 70% on lenses. That gives you a budget of around $1350 for a camera body.  As a novice, you just don't need the capabilities of a state of the art camera. I have a 5D mark IV, and honestly 95% of the time any one of my older cameras (5D mark II, 7D, 50D) is going to do the job well enough.  Bottom line is that any pro-grade DSLR made in the last 10 years is going to serve your needs perfectly well. Save your money and buy a used 5D mark III ($900-$1200) or even a 5D mark II ($500\\u2013$800). Some reputable dealers for used equipment are B&H, Adorama, Abe's of Maine, KEH, and 42nd Street Photo.  Pair that body with a good general-purpose zoom lens like the EF 24\\u201370 f/4L IS ($900) to start with. The only other must-have accessories you need with that are a circular polarizing filter (around $100) and good tripod. That is a great kit to get you started learning photography.  Save the rest of your money for now until you reach the creative limits of your initial kit\\u2026 You shouldn't buy anything you don't have a specific need for. You might also seriously consider taking some of the money you save and spending it on some photography classes at your local community college.  What your second lens is going to be depends on the direction you go with your photography. My second lens was the EF 100 f/2.8L macro because I was limited in my ability to do flower pictures by not having a macro lens. My next several purchases were lighting gear. I've bought other pieces of equipment over the years to add new capabilities to allow me to do things I couldn't do with the equipment I had at the time. Avoid the temptation to buy things just because they're new and shiny. Every single piece of gear in your collection should fill a specific need (not a want)."}, {"upvote": 2, "content": "No it's not.  But then there will never be a perfect camera, that's perfect for everyone with every style of shooting.  Is the R5 a really really good camera? Yes, it's great in fact. I am a Canon shooter, mainly sports, studio (and greenscreen for which resolution is critical) for work and personal landscape, wildlife and street. I have shot pretty much with the 5 series (starting with the classic, 5d2 then 5d3 for several years and the 5d4 for just a year) also with the 7d1/2 and the 1d4 and 1dx1. Additionally, I have owned and shot with a number of great bridge compacts and also have had sony a7 ii and iii's.  This is not a bragging exercise, just an example of a breadth of experience with several types of camera.  So the R5\\u2026how to express how I feel about it (please consider I am a still shooter and will ignore all video features so if they are important to you, please seek info elsewhere). Clearly, you can see I have an affinity for Canon (and have a fleet of Canon L and White glass) and a lot of experience with the 5d series. While the form factor is different from the regular 5d body and the buttons a little different it takes minutes to get used to this difference. In terms of performance, the EVF is bright enough and does a great job of illustrating what the exposure will be like. The autofocus is as good if not better than the 5d4 and the eye-tracking for both humans and animals is fantastic and of course, being 50mp it is outperforming my glass as using EF glass currently.  Did you note my comment about the mirrorless autofocus not being as good as my 10-year-old Canon 5d3 DSLR?  Exactly. For me, the R5 is a game-changer when it comes to mirrorless as I always found EVF lag and autofocus performance were the two roadblocks that prevented me from considering moving away from a DSLR. The R5 *feels* like a 5d series camera with a lot of the bells and whistles you expect these days from a mirrorless (exposure simulation, focus peaking, great connectivity for instant delivery online etc) but with a DSLR like experience.  The two issues as such are the change away from CF cards (of which I have a bucket load of, but offset by using the same batteries I also have a bucket load of) and the overheating issue when shooting in 8k (again I have not experienced this as I have never shot video on any of my cameras).  If you are in the market for a camera at this price point, you would be hard-pressed to find something better for the money, more so if you have access or already own any Canon glass.  I just wanted to add, I pick up the Camera and use it without thinking about it, in the same way I have done with my 5d3/4 for the past 10 years.

And I think they made some good decisions, and a few bad ones that may have not been choices as much as technical limitations.  Neither Canon nor Nikon were actually new to mirrorless with last August's introductions. But the R and the Z are professional formats, even if the first models are not a match for the top-of-the-line DSLRs yet. Both Canon and Nikon took on the idea that mirrorless was something less than DSLR, a step between DSLR and compact digital cameras (aka point and shoot). Nikon's 1 system used the same 1\\u2033 sensor size found in high-end P&S cameras like the Sony RX10 and RX100. But Canon put out a very compact APS-C system with their EOS M. And a funny thing happened: while Nikon's 1 system is now defunct, the EOS M is very popular, albeit not necessarily in the USA. Canon's been the #2 mirrorless brand in Japan in 2016 and 2017 (BCN rankings, second to Olympus) and looks to be taking the #1 spot for the 2018 year\\u2026 without even counting the EOS R. Canon seems to have nailed the consumer mirrorless ILC with the EOS M.  So it should be no surprise that Canon got into mirrorless on a higher level with the EOS R, but then again, it should be. Canon is slower to react to competition than just about anyone. Why this, why now? Canon feels the competition.  For most of history since maybe the 1940s or 1950s, Canon and Nikon had much of the professional market for cameras. In the 1960s, led by Nikon, they won an 80% share, and it's been pretty much 80\\u201390% ever since. Canon managed to flip the market share on Nikon by being the first to court consumers, and then by delivering the fastest speeds for pro sports shooters. But for a long time, the only 35mm, then full-frame choice for most pros was Nikon or Canon.  This last year, the whole industry sold only 11.6 million ILCs, less than half of those sold in 2013. And 2017 was actually an 8% increase from 2016. But more the point, DSLRs sold only accounted for 65% of the ILC market\\u2026 clearly, Nikon and Canon were no longer winning an 80\\u201390% share. And while Canon's mirrorless sales were up 70% in 2017, Nikon wasn't even part of that. And of course, neither was competitive with Sony, Olympus, Panasonic, or Fujifilm in higher-end mirrorless. No one knows just where the DSLR vs. mirrorless ratio settles out in the long term, but it's not going to be terribly favorable to any company only making DSLRs.  What's It For?  If you look carefully at the EOS R, like the Nikon Z's, you'll know just what it's for: the EOS R is a mirrorless body for Canon users to buy, so that they don't buy Sonys. This is the big factor. Canon users have been trying Sony A7s with adapters, and liking them. Some keep it as an accessory, but some sell their Canon gear and move to Sony. Canon needs that to stop, and their first reaction to this situation is the EOS R.  Canon's introducing one body and four lenses, two of them quite expensive, but still, that's not a full system for nearly anyone who needs a system camera. It's a start. But if you're already a Canon shooter, the R is with an adapter is going to let you try out mirrorless with all of your glass \\u2014 even EF-S lenses, but EF-M lenses are impossible \\u2014 your existing batteries and flash units, etc. It's a much simpler way to experiment with mirrorless for today's Canon shooter. If you're new to ILCs and want full-frame mirrorless, EOS R won't be a great option for at least 3\\u20135 years, depending on how quickly Canon rolls out new glass.  So you're supposed to compare the EOS R to a Sony A7 Mark III, but the closest match is actually the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV. So you're getting more or less a mirrorless 5D Mark IV with some improvements/extra features for $900 less. That's a pretty fine deal, speaking from the Canon universe. It's a bit more expensive than the A7 Mark III, but no one's more aggressive on body pricing than Sony.  I think it succeeds in its mission. If I still had my Canon system and was ready for full frame mirrorless, the EOS R is a no-brainer versus the Sony. It's not even the cost of the bodies or the minute details of the features, but the fact it's already part of my system. The cheap lens adapter is only $100, and it works perfectly. For a bit more, I could get the adapter with filter holder, simply brilliant for video work.  Video Issues  Alas, on that latter one, Canon's still being Canon, and not in a good way. They're still crippling 4K video on the EOS R, delivering the same 1.7x crop you have on the EOS 5D mark IV. If you're buying a full-frame DSLR for video, the point is to have full frame video. With that crop, you're better off going to a Panasonic GH5 or a Blackmagic Design Pocket Cinema Camera 4K, depending on your needs.  I expect for most stills work, you have a 5D Mark IV as far as the quality goes. You won't quite match Sony in very low light, but you'll have a bit more resolution in bright light, so it's probably not a big deal for most photographers. You'll have the Canon color, which Sony has yet to match, and the Canon menus you're used to\\u2026 well, maybe. They have a few new controls on the camera, which changes around the way its used. There's a programmable ring control on lenses, but you won't run into that with adapted EF lenses unless you get the third adapter, the one with the ring control. There's also a touch strip on the back, which most reviewers aren't yet crazy about.  Neither Sony nor Canon has 10-bit in-camera video, which is what you need for serious Log shooting. But the EOS R does have that as an external option, at least. I'd bet on Sony's A7S Mark III offering 10-bit in some fashion, but like Canon, Sony's got their own cinema camera business they feel compelled to protect by crippling the mirrorless models. Oddly, though, Nikon opted for the same thing, in-camera 8-bit, external 10-bit, even without a video market to protect. I guess that leaves them both with a feature to add to a higher end model, next year. Or save money and buy the GH5 right now.  Conclusions  So basically, I think the EOS R is attractive to anyone with a full Canon system thinking about mirrorless. If Canon's annoying behaviors haven't driven you away yet, this may well be your mirrorless. I don't really find any huge problems with it. Knowing that Sony was the initial target, nothing about the EOS R or the Nikon Zs were particularly unexpected. Both aim for the Sony's, Nikon at both the A7III and the A7RIII, Canon's basically doing the A7III competitor now. I would hope they're holding off an A7RIII competitor until they have some improved sensor tech, probably also going into the EOS 5DS Mark II."}, {"upvote": 21, "content": "The EOS 1D X is pretty much overkill\\u2026 this is kind of an odd list, with over a 12:1 price range. Not only is the 1D X around $6,000 (body-only), but you're going to need expensive CFast cards for 4K video, and the 4K video on the thing is in gigantic Motion JPEG files, and not all that amazing anyway. If I wanted a 4K camera for video, I'd recommend either get a Panasonic GH4 or perhaps a Sony A7s mark II.  The Nikon D80 (2006) and the D3 (2007) are ancient models and don't shoot video. The D3s does shoot video, but only 720p, not full HD.  The EOS 7D (2009) is also fairly old. It can shoot 720p or 1080p video, but only 12 minutes at a time. The others here can shoot 29\\u203259\\u2033 without stopping \\u2014 that's a limit set to avoid paying a European camcorder tax. While it doesn't apply at all in the USA, most camera manufacturers (other than Panasonic, far as I know) impose this limit even on North American and Japanese models.  The Nikon D5300 isn't a bad choice for video. It's a few models old, it came out in 2003, the current model is the D5600, so it's may be available for a value price. But this line is a consumer line, APS-C sensor, and not terribly expensive. It can shoot video at 1080p up to 60fps\\u2026 not something you'd need for vlogging, but you want 60p for sports or other action video. Another advantage for vlogging, the D5300 has built-in WiFi, so it can be controlled wirelessly via an app. Most Canon and Nikon can be tethered via USB for remote control, and some have add-on controls, but it's handy to have it built-in.  I have the EOS 6D, and it produces amazing video, particularly in low light, where it blows away my far more expensive dedicated camcorders. The 6D right now is a good bargain, but mostly because everyone expects Canon to announce the 6D mark II Real Soon Now. The 6D also has built-in WiFi.  The EOS 5D mark III is the upgrade of Canon's breakthrough EOS 5D mark II. It's a great camera, one of the go-to standards for video-on-stills camera shooting. But while it's a solid choice if you can afford it, it's not the best choice. For one, it's been superceeded by the EOS 5D mark IV, if you're looking for a higher end model that shoots great video.  Of those on your list, the Canon EOS 80D would be my choice for anyone wanting a strong video option. Like the Nikon, it can shoot a variety of modes up to 1080p60. But the real advantage is in the sensor. This is Canon's second-generation mid-range DSLR with what they call a Dual Pixel sensor. This sensor splits each pixel into two separate photodiodes. Based on the way they're masked, each sensor pair works like a phase-detect autofocus sensor. So unlike every other DSLR on your list, the 80D can give you full performance autofocus in video, and things you usually just find on camcorders and mirrorless cameras, like follow-focus in video, etc. Dual Pixel is also used on Canon's 5D mark IV and all the new Cinema EOS video cameras. And the 80D also has built-in WiFi.  Far as the larger idea of a full camera system goes, you can't really go wrong with either Canon or Nikon. They have the two most complete lines of cameras and two most complete collection of lenses. However, neither offers a mirrorless option. So that means you're only shooting video from the back screen, not the viewfinder. And that only the 80D on your list has fully function video autofocus\\u2026 the others will AF in video, but it's on demand, not continuous, and it's often not very good. The phase detect sensors that DSLRs use are not available with the mirror up, which is what you have in video mode.  For one-person vlogging, keep in mind you are going to want to see yourself, which means either an add-on monitor while shooting or an articulated screen. The 80D and the D5300 both have fully articulated screens which let you see what you're recording from the front of the camera. The others do not, and will absolutely require an external monitor for vlogging."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "NOT buying the Canon EOS R5, and here's why:  I have tens of thousands of dollars invested in my current system, all based on Nikon cameras and lenses. I simply can't justify \\u2018jumping ship' to a different camera or system despite the power and quality of the R5.  That is likely the overriding reason why MANY veteran photographers won't consider the Canon R5, because it's just not the camera that matters, it's everything else that fits in the camera manufacturer's ecosystem. As good as the Canon R5 may be, it can't hold a candle to my Nikon gear unless and until I am willing to add a similar collection of Canon lenses to the equation. Even at that, there are certain features and aspects of Nikon cameras/images/equipment etc. that I have learned to prefer over anything else out there.  A photographer with a sizeable investment in Sony, Fuji, or Panasonic gear is likely to have the same point of view, preferring to stay with what they know, love, and already own, than go through the process of ramping up another system.  Other factors are at play too:   * I've been buying cameras long enough to know that the major manufacturers play a constant game of leapfrog, each in turn introducing \\u2018breakthrough advances' that the other manufacturers eventually adopt, adapt, and add. It's really only a matter of time until everything that puts the R5 head-and-shoulders above the current competition is available on other manufacturers' models. (Think in-body stabilization, for example.) And, it's only a matter of time before someone else comes out with something that makes the R5 (or any other breakthrough camera) look out of date.  * Even now, Nikon is teasing its customers with the imminent release of the Z 6II and Z 7II, which both boast big improvements in video, focusing, frame rate, dynamic range, and processing power. It's enough of an upgrade to cause most Nikon shooters who might be considering a switch (to Canon or Sony) to have second thoughts. Canon, Sony, all of them do something similar, rolling out incremental improvements that make it far tougher for their current owners to abandon their current brand.  * The system a serious photographer chooses goes so deep that it becomes scary to even think about the big switch. It's not just bodies and lenses. It can include memory cards, card readers, batteries, extension tubes, teleconverters, filters, cables, flashes, flash triggers, even Photoshop/Lightroom presets!  * Whenever the unending battle over features rears its head, I try to remember that the weakest link in my photo system isn't any shortcoming in the camera, lenses, or associated gear. The weakest link is me. I'm the one who makes most of the mistakes, compromises, shortcuts, and misjudgements that impact the images I ask the camera system to create.

This is because once you buy a camera, you get lenses to fit that camera, an when it comes time to upgrade your camera body, you will want to buy the same brand as your lenses.

Canon is as good as Nikon is as good as Sony. They do have somewhat different audiences; Nikon focuses largely on the traditional still photographer market (portraiture in particular), while Canon tends to be more favored for action photography and video. I am actually not sure who Sony's core audience is, although their camera bodies are (because of the SLT setup without the moving mirror) generally simpler and lighter than an SLR body. If you wind up renting equipment for pro shoots, Nikon or Canon gear will be far easier to get than Sony/Minolta (Sony bought Konica Minolta's camera assets when they decided to focus on other parts of the business; I'm reasonably sure they've finally gotten rid of that weird Minolta flash shoe, though).   Getting past the objective bits, I'm biased in favor of Canon, partly because of their video focus, partly because their hacking community is considerably larger and better established than Nikon's (I'm not sure if Sony has a hacker community at all). Magic Lantern is a software package (basically a firmware overlay) that brings a lot of features, particularly for video, that Canon doesn't normally put in their consumer gear, including sound tools, live view information displays, and even some basic scripting functions. But if quality is your only concern, roll a d3."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "Canon and Nikon are more alike than they are different.  Hence the term \\\"Canikon\\\".  Sony's A-mount DSLT cameras are a different breed, having a fixed translucent mirror and full-time live view (off the sensor).  Sony's mirrorless cameras are even more untraditional.  I have owned Canon (crop DSLR), Sony A55 (crop DSLT), Sony A900 (full-frame DSLR), and now a Sony A7II (full-frame mirrorless).  I have appreciated the A900 and A7II the most.  My guess is that Sony will discontinue the DSLT line eventually.  You'll need to consider the type of shooting you are likely to do.  If you go Nikon or Canon you will have a huge range of lenses to choose from, made specifically for (and by) those brands.  If you go Sony mirrorless you can mount an ever-widening range of Sony/Zeiss lenses, and essentially any lens ever made, via adapters.  With the Nikon and Canon DSLRs you'll have the advantages and disadvantages of optical viewfinders, whereas with Sony you'll have the advantages and disadvantages of full-time live view.  The Sony mirrorless cameras pack a lot of functionality into a small and light package, but the ergonomics are not the best (IMO).  Full-size Canons and Nikons fit the hand nicely.  If you want to shoot very long lenses for sports or nature, you're probably better off with Canon or Nikon DSLRs.  If you want to quickly and seamlessly switch between video and stills and see exactly how your exposure will look before shooting, you probably should consider a Sony (or other mirrorless).  In my opinion, you should consider buying your body from a brick-and-mortar store (yes, it's more expensive).  That will give you the possiblity of handling the camera (or cameras) before deciding.  And here's another random suggestion:  consider buying used, or renting first.  Buying into a camera system can be an expensive proposition, and switching is even more expensive.  Have fun!"}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "There is no one 'best camera'.  The best camera for you is one that fits your budget, your shooting style and your hand.  "}, {"upvote": 2, "content": "There are some excellent answers already written and I summarize some of the good points already mentioned. They are (1) Try renting all the cameras you are considering and then decide which one to buy. It is easier to find Canon/Nikon cameras for rent as they dominate the photography industry with about 85% market share between them. That says a lot for their products and service. If you are looking at Sony then you are looking away from the most popular brands with excellent customer service which means you must have a clear reason why you choose SONY over canon/Nikon. (2) SONY is shaking up the market with its mirrorless offerings for the present and there are predictions (who knows the future?) that mirrorless will ultimately take over the market. So you are buying into a company which is \\\"expected\\\" to be dominating the future. (3) Canon/Nikon will surely enter the mirrorless market in a big way if market demand warrants it. They both have tested the mirrorless system with their modest offerings. Nikon 1 system's J5 model is already considered the best in its class. So Canon/Nikon cannot be ignored in the future. (4) Canon/Nikon have millions of lenses in the market and they cannot afford to suddenly stop making DSLRs and switch over to mirrorless technology until it is well developed. They may be doing research into it before launching a full frame mirrorless camera of their own. (5) Investment in lenses is more expensive than cameras and they last you for a life time. Old lenses can be used on newer bodies which is the strength of Nikon and Canon. Sony already has changed its mount from A to E and you have to buy an adapter to use A mount lenses on E mount cameras.  I would say that camera bodies are being changed/upgraded every 2 or 3 years by Nikon and a bit slowly by Canon. So do not worry too much about camera bodies. As suggested by some writers who are professionals it is better to concentrate on lenses availability and compatibility with cameras and buy into a system which offers what you want and allows compatibility of lenses for future cameras.  Nikon is the best in terms of compatibility although it is now moving over to newer lenses which are not compatible with older manual film cameras but most of their cameras can work with older lenses as they have not changed their F-mount. They offer Nikon Df camera which is compatible with almost all lenses Nikon has produced so far which is amazing commitment to its clients. Nikon's full frame lenses can be used on their crop sensor bodies which allows you to buy full frame lenses if you are planning to move on to full frame cameras.  Canon has different lenses for crop sensors and full frames. So when you move from crop sensor to full frame you have to buy a new set of lenses. I think Cann and Nikon will continuously work towards eliminating any gaps which exist and consumers can be assured that their needs will be ultimately taken care of. many Canon users shifted to Nikon because of the 36 MP D800 series cameras as Canon was not offering anything close to 36 MP. Now canon offers  EOS 5D with 50 MP. Will they have to shift again to Canon?  It is prudent to think clearly about the entire system offerings and their commitment to their customers before buying any system. It is also important to identify what will be your needs in the long term. You cannot go wrong with Canon/Nikon.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjwfCLrdiKE For a first time buyer, I would suggest looking into Nikon D 7100 or D 7200 or Canon 760D. This would allow you to use the camera for a life time without worrying about changing your camera. If you have a tight budget then please consider Nikon D3300 or D5300 which are the best entry level cameras overall.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jva08HY6uLE If you are considering SONY cameras, you should be aware that Sony's customer service has been criticized by Matt Granger because of his disappointing experience with SONY.

Nakamoto is believed to hold up to one million bitcoins, with an estimated value of approximately $12 billion USD (as of August 2020.) 5. Coaching is free! There's no money needed to do consulting gigs. Your life experiences and experience can be very lucrative to you for many people who are willing to pay for it. 6. Thinking is free! No money needed to solve problems. 7. The use of your knowledge is free! Knowledge is of more value than gold in the Digital Age. Remember the story of the technician who walks into a factory, replaces a screw, and charges $1,000 for the job? Why? the manager asked. One thousand dollars for a screw?  The technician answered, Yes, that was one dollar for the screw and $999 for knowing WHICH screw to replace. Late in life, I concluded what my problem was: Hard work is needed!  Thomas A. Edison said it best:  Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.  My friend, nothing ever happens without action. No action, no progress. No progress, no growth. Get started today. Stop blaming the chaotic world we live in. I'll let you in on a secret: it won't get any better anytime soon.

While it shares characteristics and applications with other blockchain platforms like Ethereum, Cardano distinguishes itself from others through a commitment to peer-reviewed scientific research as building blocks for updates to its platform.  Opinion of Wikipedia  EOS is a blockchain protocol based on the cryptocurrency EOS. The smart contract platform claims to eliminate transaction fees and also conduct millions of transactions per second.  Cardano (ADA) VS EOS  Cardano (ADA) uses Ouroboros, a PoS based consensus, while EOS uses dPoS. There is transaction fees in the Cardano (ADA) platform, while EOS does not charge transaction fees. EOS did not design a Blockchain of its own to enhance scalability while Cardano (ADA) developed their Blockchain.  My opinion  Cardano (ADA) is a better investment.  Extra Tips:  Where to stake Cardano?  We can easily stake our Cardano (ADA) in Azure ADA Stake Pool. Follow the space and find more Cardano (ADA) information:  https://cardanoadastakepool.quora.com/ "}, {"upvote": 8, "content": "Both Cardano and EOS offer similar functionality and comprehensiveness and are approximately equally scalable.  However, there is one big difference, namely that EOS is extremely centralized with only 21 consensus nodes and Cardano is near infinitely decentralized through side-chains/off-chain/horizontal scaling.  This is the one big difference that decides everything, because anyone can build a centralized, highly scalable platform. You just pick a normal database and build on it. There is no challenge in that. The huge difficulty is decentralizing it.  Cardano has managed to achieve that, EOS has not and its design prevents it from decentralizing in the future.  However, since you probably are interested in investing in either Cardano or EOS, there are 2 projcets that do the exact same thing and that a lot better.  The first platform is Elastos, which is even more comprehensive and efficient than Cardano as a dapps platform.  The other platform is Skycoin, which is also a dapps platform, but focuses more on their main product, the completely decentralized internet. They have just launched its testnet last week and will soon ship Skyminers (Data storage units) and antennas for $100 that can provide 7,000 people with high speed internet at a range of around 20km to make ISPs obsolete. They only need a couple of thousand Skyminers and antennas per each European country and we are completely independent from ISPs and can get cheap and decentralized internet anywhere anytime. This is especially helpful in nations where the internet is censored or where access to internet is really difficult or expensive, such as in Africa."}, {"upvote": 2, "content": "ADA looks good but not the best one.

I don't think I have spent this long researching a post in a year, but it is time. The last 2 years have been very tumultuous and has thrown the whole world upside down.  To answer the question, no both Cardano and Solana are quite bad blockchains or investments.  Numerous blockchains have sprung into existence in this bull run, 33 overall that I have researched and rated all by security, scalability, user friendliness and adoption from 1\\u201310 and summed up their individual characteristics into a final rating.  This gives us the following tier list.  S-Tier  1. NEAR 9/10/9/8 = 36 NEAR has created a sharding architecture that provides them with virtually unlimited scalability while maintaining excellent decentralization. On top of that, they had a number of additional small improvements that make their sharding technology more secure and performant.  NEAR has 100 validators [ https://explorer.near.org/nodes/validators ], which is not so decentralized yet, that's why it's at a 9 in security still. There is also transactional sharding by ZIL that has somewhat higher performance in transaction throughput, albeit to the detriment of usability and simplicity. Theoretically, ZIL's transactional sharding could be more scalable, but it would be behind in security and usability.  However, with its EVM-compatible framework Aurora, NEAR makes it very easy for developers to port their dapps to their ecosystem, which is a wormhole for siphoning off users from Ethereum.   As a result, NEAR already has 15 million total accounts, 15,000 daily active addresses (DAA), 800,000 daily transactions [ https://explorer.near.org/stats ] and $500M in TVL (NEAR + AURORA) [ https://defillama.com/chains ], which gives them them an 8 in adoption.  At a $2B market cap, it makes them looks undervalued at this point. 2. EGLD 10/10/9/6 = 35 EGLD has built a multisharding architecture [ https://docs.elrond.com/technology/adaptive-state-sharding ], called adaptive sharding. Adaptive sharding is a mix of all the 3 types of sharding technologies network sharding, state sharding and transactional sharing, called adaptive sharding. This enables it to possibly achieve very high transaction throughputs and to also not have a limitation on scalability.  EGLD has very good decentralization with 3,200 validators [ https://explorer.elrond.com/validators ] instead of the 100 that NEAR has. EGLD also has a burn mechanism. As well, with its EVM-compatible framework Arwen, EGLD makes it very easy for developers to port their dapps to their ecosystem, which is a wormhole for siphoning off users from Ethereum.   Still, currently EGLD has 10x fewer total addresses, daily transactions and 1/4 of the TVL with 1.6M total accounts, 85,000 daily transactions [ https://growth.elrond.com/ ] and $150M in TVL compared to NEAR, giving it a 6/10. However, EGLD can soon gain more adoption and increase its adoption points.  A $1B market cap also makes EGLD look very undervalued. 3. FTM 8/9/7/8 = 32 With its DAG-architecture, Fantom is apparently able to process around 10,000 TPS without sacrificing decentralization. Fantom also has strong adoption with 2M holders [ https://ftmscan.com/chart/tx ], 30,000 DAA [ https://pro.nansen.ai/multichain/fantom ], 800,000 daily transactions [ https://pro.nansen.ai/multichain/fantom ] and $1.2B TVL, giving them a 8/10.   However, it doesn't have such good decentralization with only 40 validators. It also costs 500,000 FTM = $150,000 to become a validator, which currently prevents more nodes to come on board. That would need to change so that FTM can become more decentralized.  Still, at only a $700M market cap, it looks undervalued for an S-Tier 3rd best Layer-1 blockchain. 4. AVAX 7/6/8/9 = 32 AVAX currently has the most adoption of all new blockchains that came into existence in 2021 and it also has a very interesting architecture similar to IOTA with Tangles and Subnets that can reach 4,500 TPS each. Those Subnets are not live yet, so currently, it cannot sport those features that provide additional scalability. Currently, it's limited to 200 TPS on its main-chain called the C-Chain, making it an 8 in security and a 6 in scalability.   However, those subnets do not benefit from shared security with the main-chain which makes those subnets more vulnerable to attacks or takeovers. Therefore, it can only have a 7 in security.  With $4.2B in TVL [ https://defillama.com/chains ], 75,000 DAA [ https://stats.avax.network/dashboard/overview/ ] and 1M daily transactions, AVAX still deserves a 9 in adoption. However, it's tech is not so convincing at this point, it has a very high market cap of $10B and it looks like it will lose its adoption to NEAR and EGLD, which would decrease its ranking significantly as well. A-Tier  1. ONE 8/9/8/4 = 29 ONE has similar sharding to NEAR, but less adoption. With 2M total addresses, 22,000 DAA, 900,000 daily transactions [ https://explorer.harmony.one/ ] and $20M TVL, it gets a 4 in adoption. At a $600M market cap it looks fairly valued considering the low adoption. 2. BSC 4/7/9/9 = 29 BSC is a very centralized blockchain by Binance. With 1.5M daily active addresses [ https://bscscan.com/chart/active-address ], 5M daily transactions [ https://bscscan.com/chart/tx ] and $9B TVL, it has a ton of adoption for sure, but for making good profits, this is not such a good choice due to very high market cap of $50B and high centralization. 3. SOL 6/7/7/9 = 29 Solana is able to process 10,000 TPS apparently. However, their network has been suffering from multiple issues and failures this year. They have lots of adoption with 1M daily active addresses [ https://analytics.solscan.io/public/dashboard/8d888828-baae-47b9-948b-d087e5de1411 ], 50M daily transactions [ https://solanabeach.io/ ] and $4B TVL, however, with so much strong competition in the S-Tier, a struggling network and already a very high market cap of $20B, the future of Solana seems bleak and should be coming with declining adoption. 4. ZIL 9/10/7/2 = 28 ZIL also has really good technology with their sharding architecture, however, probably not as good as EGLD in terms of scalability and security and not as good as usability as NEAR.   With 216,000 total addresses, 16,000 DAA [ https://viewblock.io/zilliqa/stat/activeAddresses ], 40,000 daily transactions [ https://viewblock.io/zilliqa/stat/txCountHistory ] and only $14M in TVL, it also doesn't have so much adoption. Still, ZIL has a ton of potential and with a market cap of only $700M, can show great performance in the next bull cycle, especially when they manage to gain significant adoption. 5. ETH 9/2/7/10 = 28 Here we go with ETH. Obviously, the platform with the most adoption by far in crypto with 200M total addresses, 500,000 DAA [ https://etherscan.io/chart/active-address ] and $70B TVL. Technology is still lacking, so we need to wait this year for improvements with 2.0. 6. FSN 8/8/5/6 = 27 Fusion is running a PBFT consensus algorithm allowing 2,000\\u20133,000 TPS. They also have decent adoption with 1M total addresses, 700,000 daily transactions [ https://fsnex.com/stats ] and $150M TVL, giving them a 6/10.  At a market cap of only $27M, such high TVL and 90% of the supply being in circulating, Fusion also looks very undervalued by a factor of 10x! 7. MATIC 4/7/7/9 = 27 MATIC has had a very successful 2021 and tons of adoption. It's basically the PoS technology that ETH 2.0 is aiming to have. It is limited to 1,000 TPS though and those are used up frequently, so MATIC still needs to find additional ways to scale before it can show great market performance as well. With 100M total addresses, 200,000 DAA [ https://polygonscan.com/chart/active-address ], 2.5M daily transactions [ https://polygonscan.com/chart/tx ] and $3B TVL, MATIC does have very strong adoption of a 9/10.  However, their network is currently extremely centralized with 5 individuals being able to compromise $4B in value. 4 of those individuals are the founders of Polygon. As a result, Polygon is very vulnerable to a social attack where one the founders can be tricked or manipulated into an exploit through coercion, extortion, social engineering, negligence, oversight or any kind of manipulation tactic. See this Twitter thread [ https://twitter.com/Justin_Bons/status/1523712300334878721?s=20&t=UWVwZtx4af-xaxjGeD1E4w ] for more info.  Another issue is that they have hit their scalability bottleneck already with 10M daily transactions and 1,000 transactions/second, so their future potential is quite limited. Considering the centralized architecture and the scalability bottleneck, a $5B market cap for it just looks too high. 8. SYS 9/10/5/2 = 26 Syscoin has a very interesting DAG architecture  [ https://syscoin.org/news/new-tech-drives-record-transaction-speeds-for-syscoin#:~:text=Syscoin%20can%20achieve%20over%2060%2C000,such%20as%20EOS%20and%20QTUM. ]allowing them to go to 80,000 TPS. They only have 10,000 total addresses, 100 daily transactions [ https://ethstats.syscoin.org/#explorer ] and only $5M in TVL, so they don't have much adoption, but at a $180M market cap they are a blockchain to keep an eye on. 9. IOTA 10/10/5/1 = 26 IOTA has a great architecture with their Tangle, it might be the best architecture by far. However, it'll take some more time until the architecture has been fully developed and they don't have much adoption currently. As well, their Coordicide and Shimmer algorithm has been delayed without a known date, which is not good. You can follow their development progress here [ https://roadmap.iota.org/ ].  At a $1B market cap, IOTA looks fairly valued. 10. DOT 7/9/8/1 = 25 Polkadot also has a sidechain-architecture and a vibrant ecosystem. Their ecosystem is still pretty young, so they only have 1,500 DAA [ https://messari.io/asset/polkadot/chart/act-addr-cnt ] and a TVL of $200,000 [ https://defillama.com/chain/Polkadot ].  That's why its $10B market cap looks very overvalued currently. 11. KDA 8/9/7/1 = 25 KDA has a very unique architecture that has similarities with ELA, namely that they are using PoW sidechains to scale. To me, ELA has a more elegant architecture, but KDA has a lot more hype and has backing by billionaires. KDA has very little adoption with only 20,000 DAA, 20,000 daily transactions [ https://anedak.com/beta ] and $5M TVL, but they can reach $1B this year certainly as well.  A $500M market cap seems fair for KDA right now. 12. HBAR 8/9/4/4 = 25 Here, we have Hedera Hashgraph, which has a great architecture, however, it is a permissioned and corporate blockchain. 700,000 DAA, 300,000 daily transactions [ https://hash-hash.info/ ] and TVL of $50M gives them a 4/10.  That's why a $4B market cap seems quite overvalued for HBAR right now. B-Tier  1. MTV 9/10/5/0 = 24 MultiVAC's consensus module runs a Proof-of-Stake based Byzantine consensus algorithm with sharding and claims to be able to make 30,000 TPS. With 50,000 total accounts and 200,000 daily transactions [ https://mtvscout.com/ ], their adoption also seems decent.  A market cap of only $12M seems very undervalued for MTV. However, their team is also anonymous, which has created quite some FUD and seems to have reduced the trust of the community [ https://twitter.com/l8gendary/status/1528164124173160450?s=20&t=xYrwHyGeGzpSDQ4-hsFrQg ]. 2. ADA 10/4/6/4 = 24 With its dPoS consensus algorithm and 3,000 validators, ADA has decent technology and great decentralization, though it also only allows ADA to do 250 TPS. They do have 3,000 validators which is great decentralisation. However, ADA has decent adoption with 75,000 daily active addresses [ https://messari.io/charts/cardano/act-addr-cnt ], 100,000 daily transactions [ https://messari.io/asset/cardano/chart/txn-cnt ] and $130M in TVL and it will likely grow into the billions in a bull cycle. So, ADA is not a terrible coin to have, but it's also already lagging behind in every manner compared to the S-Tier coins.  That's why a $28B market cap still very overvalued for ADA for being a B-Tier coin. 3. AZERO 9/9/5/0 = 23 Aleph Zero is a completely new blockchain out of Switzerland that is just 2 months old. It has an interesting asymetric BFT algorithm that allows it to make 100,000 TPS [ https://medium.com/@daolecticresearch/aleph-zero-the-new-layer-1-game-changer-4a328475c4a ] apparently.   It doesn't have much adoption yet, but is sitting at a $300M market cap, which seems like a fair valuation and makes it worth keeping an eye on. 4. HOT 8/10/4/3 = 23 Holochain has a peer-to peer HashMap as a blockchain architecture, which allows them to have virtually unlimited TPS. There are no TVL numbers for HOT as of now. However, they have 120,000 ERC-20 token holders [ https://etherscan.io/token/0x6c6ee5e31d828de241282b9606c8e98ea48526e2 ], which is decent and which makes it reasonable to grant them a 3/10 for adoption.  Its market cap of $500M also makes them look fairly valued. 5. XTZ 9/3/7/3 = 22 Tezos has good security with their PoS chain, however, it can only do 300 TPS, so scalability is limited. They do have decent adoption with 20,000 daily active addresses, [ https://messari.io/asset/tezos/chart/act-addr-cnt ] $50M in TVL [ https://defillama.com/chains ] and 200,000 daily transactions [ https://tzstats.com/activity ], which puts them at around 3/10 for adoption.  However, its $2B market cap seems very high and overvalued for being so far down in this list. 6. ELA 9/9/3/1 = 22 ELA has a similar and very elegant architecture as KDA. However, they have always been struggling with marketing and adoption and only have 500 DAA,  [ https://hecoinfo.com/token/0xa1ecfc2bec06e4b43ddd423b94fef84d0dbc8f5c#balances ]$5M TVL as a result. A small market cap of $55M seems fair for ELA for that reason. 7. IOTEX 7/7/5/2 = 21 IoTeX has built their EVM-compatible blockchain using an innovative Roll-DPoS consensus. Still, with 5k holders and a TVL of $40M, they can only get a 2/10 for adoption.  A market cap of $400M also seems overvalued for that reason. 8. NANO 4/7/7/2 = 20 Nano has a block-lattice architecture that can support up to 1,000 TPS. They have a 600,000 total addresses and 300,000 daily transactions [ https://nanolooker.com/distribution ], so get a 3/10 for adoption. However, they have several vulnerabilites [ https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/03/11/nanos-network-flooded-with-spam-nodes-out-of-sync/https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/03/11/nanos-network-flooded-with-spam-nodes-out-of-sync/ ], which is bad for security.  That said, a $200M seems fair for Nano. 9. ICX 8/6/2/2= 18 ICON is focusing on becoming the hub to connect blockchains via its Blockchain Transmission Protocol (BTP), which it is already doing with with Polkadot, Ethereum and ONE. Currently, it only has 70,000 total accounts [ https://bloks.io/ ], 55,000 daily transactions [ https://messari.io/charts/eos/price ], 2,500 DAA and $76M TVL, so it deserves a 2/10.  A $400M market cap for ICX is fairly valued and might be slightly undervalued. 10. XRP 5/5/5/2 = 17 Nearly all of the blockchains here offer everything that XRP offers, fast transactions. However, the other blockchains are a lot more decentralized and easier to use. XRP also has no bank using it after 7 years and billions in capital available. A failure.  At a market cap of $20B, they are probably overvalued by a factor of 20x. 11. BTC 5/1/2/9 = 17 Bitcoin has a bad architecture, but it has its place as digital gold.  Therefore, it is currently slightly undervalued at a market cap of $600B and should settle above $1T this or next year. 12. TRX 3/7/3/3 = 16 TRX is an artificial ecosystem with no money in it except for Justin Sun's own money. All of its metrics are fake. Therefore, a market cap of $7.5B is also overvalued. 13. XLM 5/7/3/1 = 16 XLM is an abandoned coin that only has $20M in TVL. It does have 7M total addresses, 800,000 daily transactions and 60,000 DAA [ https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/ ], but I suspect 95% of those are fake.  That also makes them very overvalued with their current market cap of $7B. C-Tier are  1. DASH 10/2/2/1 = 15 Dash include features such as Masternodes, ChainLocks, PrivateSend. Masternodes oversee the network and have the power to reject new blocks added by nodes if they were approved improperly. It uses two-tier network PoW and PoS, which is very good for security and also for scalability.  They have a good number of 1.5M total accounts  [ https://dash.tokenview.com/en/ ]since it was one of the first L1-blockchains, but their blockchain is quite outdated since they don't offer any dapps, but only simple transactions. As a result, they only have 15,000 daily transactions and don't have TVL, so their adoption is quite low and it doesn't look like that will change much in the future. Therefore, they only get a 1 in adoption.  With a market cap of $1B they seem overvalued. 2. DGB 8/2/5/0 = 15 DigiByte uses five different algorithms to improve security and is a decent money transferring blockchain. It does have 2M total accounts, however, it's also quite an abandoned blockchain without much development going on. As a result, it only has 8,000 DAA and 10,000 daily transactions [ https://dgb.tokenview.com/en/ ] an no TVL.  A $250M market cap seems fair for DGB. 3. DCR 9/2/1/0 = 12 Decred employs a hybrid PoW/PoS system with good security and decent scalability. It does have 5M total accounts, however, it's also quite an abandoned blockchain without much development going on. As a result, it only has 9,000 DAA, 10,000 daily transactions [ https://dgb.tokenview.com/en/ ] an no TVL.  Its $750M market cap seems overvalued for that reason. 4. EOS 2/6/2/0= 10 EOS probably has the worst architecture out of all blockchains in crypto. It does have 5M total accounts [ https://bloks.io/ ], 700,000 daily transactions [ https://messari.io/charts/eos/price ] and $135M TVL, but 99% of these numbers are fake, which you can see by the fact that they only have 3,000 DAA [ https://messari.io/charts/eos/act-addr-cnt ], which gives them a 0 in adoption.  Therefore, a $1.3B for EOS is drastically overvalued. 5. NEO 2/6/2/0 = 10 The project wants to release Neo 3.0, which apparently will improve its blockchain tech, however, as of now it is very centralized. It does have 6M total accounts, but only 12,000 DAA and 500 daily transactions [ https://neo.tokenview.com/en/ ], so it has a 0 in adoption.  Therefore, a $1.1B for NEO is drastically overvalued. Now, let's sum up all of these blockchains again and see what market caps they could achieve when Bitcoin does a 2x and hits $60,000 again.  1. FSN $25M undervalued by 20x = $1B target = 40x profit 2. MTV $12.5M undervalued by 10x = $250M target = 25x profit 3. NEAR $2B undervalued by 20x = $40B target = 20x profit 4. EGLD $1B undervalued by 20x = $20B target = 20x profit 5. FTM $500M undervalued by 4x = $10B target = 20x profit 6. ZIL $500M fairly valued = $10B target = 20x profit 7. NANO $100M fairly valued = $2B target = 20x profit 8. SYS $100M undervalued by 3x = $1B target = 10x profit 9. KDA $300M fairly valued = $2.5B target = 9x profit 10. ELA $30M fairly valued = $200M target = 7x profit 11. ONE $300M fairly valued = $2B target = 6x profit 12. AZERO $200M undervalued by 2x = $1B target = 5x profit 13.

However, MTV's team is anonymous, which is a risk factor.  Conclusion These are all the relevant blockchain of 2022, quite a lot of them! Which one to add to your portfolio?  Fortunately, the above ranking is quite clear. The best L1-blockchains that have lower risk and that can produce 10x profits in the short term once Bitcoin goes back to $60,000 by far are  1. NEAR 2. EGLD It seems like the tech aspects of EGLD are better (security, scalability) while the growth aspects for NEAR are better (usability, adoption).  In crypto, growth trumps everything. For example, Ethereum and Solana have terrible tech, but they have so much adoption that it didn't matter at all, because they went all in on adoption.  For that reason, I'm going all in on NEAR and EGLD.  The best way to buy EGLD is on their Maiar wallet [ https://get.maiar.com/referral/kxl2klocjd ], which will give you $10 for depositing $200 in EGLD and is touted to be the best wallet in crypto currently as well, check out this amazing UI.

IMHO you have a window of opportunity right now to get ADA at a decent price. Some time after the Alonzo fork in late August 2021, and Smart Contracts go live, ADA should see a big run up. I could be wrong on this but there are a lot of knowledgable peeps who are saying something similar to me on this.  What could go wrong with this forecast / idea? Well the latest stimulus package could fail in Congress and cause a stock market crash which would likely have a residual effect on the Bitcoin and the Crypto market. Or Bitcoin might have already seen it's bull market high back in May and this latest run up past 40k is just a dead cat bounce. If BTC reverses the upward momentum and heads down towards 20K then it will also have a negative effect on ADA. I don't think that is going to happen (a move back toward 20K) but I could be wrong.  But I look at ADA as a long term hold. Even if we have seen a peak in the crypto market, holding for the long term makes sense. Staking ADA through delegated stakers and socked away for at least 5 years would still produce a sizable gain, probably better than the Stock market could do for you. IMHO ADA could reach $30 to $40 bucks with in 5 years. And the staking reward will add to the ROI potentially giving you 50% more ADA than you started with.

With that in mind, I'm also not one with a crystal ball to predict the future and the behavior of markets, trends and business partnerships in this space.  And again! I'm not saying that Matic is an unsavy investment at all, but only in regards to one over the other in my opinion. I'm not an expert, only interested in further education and this is a fascinating topic.  Firstly, Ethereum and Matic have a first mover advantage for now, but as the space grows so does the competition. Polygon is a protocol that connects and builds Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks and valuable projects. This is a comparison of layer 1 And layer 2 block chain.  Polygon is a layer 2 that operates on Ethereum (layer1) based block chain with cheaper than Ethereum fees, and is highly secured. It's an attractive project and good investment, as Ethereum currently has the largest portion of the market and its ERC-20 smart contract tokens. One can look at Ethereum as running the city and Matic as running its districts, or like a lower court that is subservient to Supreme court- Ethereum. So, if Ethereum does well and stays in business, Matic will probably do well as well.  Polygon-Matic Specs/track record   * 400 +Dapps including decentralized exchanges, gaming and NFT's.

Worth the mention is a converter mechanism which will allow Ethereum projects to do business with Cardano if they choose to do so. That may affect Ethereum's market share and in turn Matic's as well. Cardano's algorithm and protocol may eventually service mulititude of venues including: business, banking, political, space technology, entrepreneurial, educational and gaming sectors, as ADAptions become widespread. Cardano has a big plan of going for the continent of Africa with its advantage of decentralized network and a smart contract platform that may benefit the disadvantaged. Noble cause I believe. Africa is a young continent with regards to the population, much more so than Europe, Americas or even parts of Asia and is still largely undeveloped.  130 + peer reviewed papers regarding the application and function of Cardano-ADA Blockchain are in existence.

So none was at his full potential. Aizen is immortal, so at the end, here he will be the last standing, even if I think Ichigo is probably slightly more powerful, but it is debatable, for Zaraki, has full power, he is quite near to their level if we speak in terms of Reiatsu.  Zaraki's striking power is just amazing, so if Aizen or Ichigo are hit by him, they'll just be cut in half by his Bankai, however Zaraki does not mastered it yet, so he self destructs himslef with the power of his Bankai , so this is double-edged, while Kenpachi uses his Bankai, he becomes a mindless berserker that is unable to differentiate between friend and foe and fights with no regards for his own well-being, If Kenpachi's Bankai releases more power than his body can handle, his body will start breaking under the pressure.  Aizen has a way to handle Zaraki in long-range combat, with Kid\\u014d spells for example, however Had\\u014d # 90 probably does not work on Zaraki, we have seen that Zaraki was able to cut space itself, Had\\u014d # 99 would probably be powerful enough to stop Zaraki though, even in his Bankai even if it is not totally certain. If needed, Aizen can just use Ky\\u014dka Suigetsu and stabbed Zaraki in his back.  In the case of Ichigo, he can also avoid going into melee with Zaraki, using Getsuga Tensh\\u014d or Gran Rey Cero. Aizen and Ichigo are Shunpo Masters, so that gives them some advantage in terms of speed, just a bit. While he possesses no known skill in Shunpo, Kenpachi is deceptively fast for his size and build. Thanks to the tremendous raw strength in his legs, Kenpachi's natural acceleration more than make up for his lack of Shunpo, allowing him to move fast enough to instantly close a huge gap of space between him and his opponent, and even seemingly disappear from sight. In battle, he can strike with incredible speed in rapid succession, making it highly difficult for his opponents to find an opening and counterattack. During his short battle with Byakuya, Kenpachi manages to keep up with his opponent's incredibly fast Shunpo, a feat which shocked and impressed Byakuya.  However Zaraki does not have to be in a melee to damage or even kill his opponents, he can create a powerful shock wave, Kenpachi's Bankai grants him tremendous physical strength and cutting power, allowing him to effortlessly topple a gigantic Gerard Valkyrie with a single blow, rip off his arm in a single motion, and cut him completely in half from a considerable distance. He can also use Ry\\u014ddan and cut Ichigo or Aizen in two instantly, Kenpachi possesses some knowledge and skill in Kend\\u014d, which Yamamoto forced him to learn before officially joining the Gotei 13, though the training only lasted a day out of fear that Zaraki would become too powerful. However, Kenpachi, who despises using skills and techniques learned from another source, only uses Kend\\u014d as a last resort. Ry\\u014ddan, a technique which Kenpachi uses when he is gripping his sword with two hands. It allows one to split an opponent down the middle, if he uses this with his Shikai, he should do a lot, a lot of damage, probably kill his opponent with one slash.  So I think Zaraki is going to cut them into pieces, end up taking a lot of damage and being defeated, Aizen will survive with his regeneration and win the fight. Aizen could win easily enough if he uses his Shikai directly, even if Ichigo is probably able to cancel it. Overall, it can go in many ways, but Aizen ended up winning.

I'll only promote the Bleach scans server that we're working on.  https://discord.gg/TUMMcvpHbR And the KSI server too  https://discord.gg/8vAFUtSFQK So onto the answer LMAO.   Before I make this answer, I want to address something.  Ichigo did indeed get his powers back or at the very least his Quincy powers.  Not only that but Ichigo in TYBW got his Zanpakuto basically restored by Tsukushima.  Now, if you pay attention to the first scan for a bit.  He basically made a completely different and alternate past where Ichigo's Zangetsu was never destroyed, think about it like this.  Let's say there's a past, a past that can't change, or anything like that because it already happened, and in front of the past is an infinite amount of possibilities, and as Yhwach states, the future to him appears like sand.  As he states, he can just pluck one grain of sand and change that, so because of that, ALL of those future timelines have been affected by Yhwach, and in basically every since one of them, he's destroy Zangetsu.  So what Tsukushima does, is create an alternate past, where Zangetsu was never destroyed, basically making new infinite timelines that Yhwach has never affected yet.  Basically all of this allows Orihime to revert the sword back to it's original form.   Now to ACTUALLY get onto the answer.  Due to all of this, we can say that EOS Ichigo most likely wins.  He was low end relative to a Yhwach as he was able to harm EOS Ichigo in the fight  Not only that but in the fight, he was able to severely harm Yhwach too  Not only that but Yhwach himself compliments Ichigo  And in fact, he even broke Ichigo's Zangetsu because it might have been overpowered.  Kenpachi is strong in his own right, he's stated to basically be the strongest Soul Reaper  (Won't beat Ichigo but).  Still though, Kenpachi has some good feats, but EOS Ichigo was able to fight Yhwach and be lower end relative to him.  I don't see any way for Kenpachi to win.   So imo, EOS Ichigo wins.

Ikomikidomoe could also release 1000's upon 1000's of Adjuchas class Hollows. His voice caused the atmosphere to quake and created tornadoes \\ud83c\\udf2a. This form overwhelmed them but still wasn't close to Hikone's full power.  Hikone's next form unleashed a more dense and powerful yet smaller version of Ikomikidomoe with spiritual pressure surpassing Vasto Lorde Arrancars(to put it gently). Hikone was separate in this form as well and could engage Zaraki Kenpachi in battle, in base forms. Ikomikidomoe far surpassed all the Arrancars in power and Hikone was superior to Ikomikidomoe\\u2026  [code]Lowering his head, he releases his zanpakuto. But this time, the release command was a totally different one. \\\"Hatch the deceased, Ikomikidomoe!\\\" And thus, 'it' was born. Accompanied by a tornado of raging reiatsu, the blade of the zanpakuto morphed to form a creature. Although it was much smaller than the previous one, it was still the size of a small house. Its reiatsu was even more condensed than the one before it; as though it had greatly shrunk; the strength of the reiatsu seemed balanced with Hikone's abnormality. A white aberration that gave off an impression of specializing in killing; resembling a beast with an overwhelming presence who could bring about the end of the world by letting no one live. \\\"It's strange. Although the size is closer to that of an Adjuchas, the reiatsu is higher than that of a Vasto Lorde, even among Arrancars.\\\" [/code]Higher density/consolidation of Reishi = greater potency\\u2026 Ikomikidomoe has the highest degree of this among Arrancars and overwhelming speed and immediate regeneration\\u2026  [code]Ikomikidomoe was an aberration that encompassed the advantages possessed by each of the three classes of Menos; Gilian, Adjuchas and Vasto Lorde, with the highest and deepest degree of spirit consolidation. Despite its bulky build, it performed Sonido effortlessly, so much so, that the echo felt like the nightmarish cry of the Nue. With such unstoppable speed, it appeared before the eyes; and plunged in its claws... Even if dodged and attacked back, it consumes reishi from the surroundings and performs instant regeneration so that the wound closes up immediately. [/code]Hikone's final form is his merging with a condensed Ikomikidomoe to create a new being. This condensed him further so the power is like heaven and earth compared to the previous form\\u2026  [code]The creature's remains began to collapse as it shone white and wind wrapped around Hikone's body. The next instant, the creature had returned to being a pure white katana, held in the hand of Hikone; whose face took on a distinct Hollow-like appearance. Clad in a shihakusho with the shadow of a Hollow creeping into his skin, Hikone's look was akin to that of an Arrancar. A fusion of Shinigami and Hollow. A mixture of black and white; yin and yang. Clasped in Hikone's hand, the pure white zanpakuto developed black splotches on its surface. It was not just the appearance that had changed. [/code]And the first speed movement shown from the perspective of the author\\u2026  [code]\\\"Well, see you all later!\\\" Even with such tremendous power, his personality and sexual ambiguity did not change. In the blink of an eye, Hikone leapt towards the sky. He covered the huge distance from the ground to the sky with what can only be described as 'godspeed', as though the surrounding movements were somehow delayed for an instant. [/code]He's MASSIVELY faster than even the improved Ressurected Arrancars. Hikone ascended to the sky to battle the Kenpachi. This is even more significant as a much weaker Kenpachi was compared to the Vasto Lorde Ichigo by Uryu's very perceptive observation.  Abilities  Cero, Gran Rey Cero, Instant Regeneration, Continuous growth(in power and experience in battles, between battles and subconsciously), Hollow sense, Hierro, Sonido, Hirenkyaku, Reishi absorption, Blut Vene, Blut Arterie, Blut Anhaben, Quincy arrows, Reishi manipulation, Bringer light, Fullbring manipulation of the surrounding, possesses a sea of consciousness(the minds of countless beings), Hakuda, Quincy sense, Shinigami sensing, the ability to combine techniques(flash step + Sonido + Bringer light + Hirenkyaku = Excess speed) and can also combine offensive or defensive abilities\\u2026 example:  [code]Hikone created a bow in the air; strengthening it by employing the Quincy technique: Blut Arterie, and shot an arrow by condensing a Cero. \\\"What the hell? Is he serious?\\\" Liltotto was amazed at the combination of two incompatible attributes. [/code]Through Ikomikidomoe: Endless Reishi absorption, infinite evolution, spawning armies of Hollows from its body, Regeneration, Energy based attacks absorption, morphing of its body, arm manifestation, Opening of portals across Dimensions, etc.  He ended being drained of power later because of Shuhei's Bankai(Yes, Shuhei's Bankai is very overpowered). The Hollow emerged from the sword and was about to call its true name\\u2026 Zaraki immediately jumped into Shikai by pure instinct and cut him down before he could do it\\u2026 He was returned to sword form and Hikone was spared(Shuhei is kinda like his father figure who set him up outside Seirete to live peacefully).  But, if Kenpachi, who usually reduces his power to allow for a good fight instinctively jumped to Shikai(which he wasn't even willing to do against Hikone) in order to slay Ikomikidomoe before he released his true power\\u2026. then what kind of abomination is Ikomikidomoe's true form? \\ud83e\\udd2b  Cheers \\ud83e\\udd42  Check out\\u2026 Soul Society [ https://soulsociety.quora.com/ ], Shinobi and Shinigami [ https://shinobiandshinigami.quora.com/ ], Shonen 3 \\u5c11\\u5e74\\u4e09 [ https://shonen3.quora.com/ ], Sh\\u014dnen Central [ https://shonencentral.quora.com/ ]  Anime Heaven [ https://animeheaven.quora.com/ ], Broken dreams [ https://brokendream.quora.com/ ], Where is the love?

With Hogyoku they can Hollowfy themselves to become Arrancars. This would give them the massive multiplier for full Hollow transformations from a Shinigami base. 2. They could evolve their potential to the pinnacle. This mostly goes for Zaraki since even during the battle against Gerard his body was straining under the pressure of his Bankai. His body can still evolve even further\\u2026 although, of course he's stronger after the 10 years and novel events.  Yamamoto has already evolved to the state of insanity with the core temperature of a star and existence erasure\\u2026 if he went further it would be absurd.  3. While Hogyoku takes you to your potential or breaks the boundary between different types of entities, there is one more aspect of Hogyoku relationship which exists\\u2026 subjugation. This process makes you the master and Hogyoku respond directly to your will and protects, remakes, resurrects and evolves you continuously.

Will try to give a generalised answer.  General Acceptance: Ethereum better known for its market capitalisation. Means they have more money in circulation. The only coin that beats Ethereum is Bitcoin in this regard. ETH also more well known than EOS. i.e., more places you can trade especially decentralized exchanges. Ethereum also has better wallet support.  Developer Support: Ethereum's developer community is larger than EOS's. There's a vast array of developers available if one wants to develop a dApp. However, the EOS block producers and block producer candidates are (indirectly) incentivized to help the dev community by providing support, tools and sometimes funding. The amount of support for EOS currently is phenomenal.  Smart Contracts: Solidity, the smart contract language for Ethereum is very close to Javscript and is purpose built for smartcontracts. With the Python version [ https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/v0.1.0-beta.10/ ] is out, it will be easier to code. EOS supports Webassembly smartcontracts usually written on C++. Technically you can write the code in any language which can compile into WASM though. There are IDEs [ https://www.eosstudio.io/ ] to help. If you are just starting to code contracts, you would be better off with EOS in my opinion.  Scalability: ETH's blocks are produced in ~15 seconds. EOS block time is ~500milli seconds. If you are developing an app for a consumer, you may find EOS closer fit for real-world scenarios. For a better comparison, EOS supports around 1000 TPS (transactions per second) while ETH is at 15TPS. Currently EOS accounts for 68% [ https://www.blocktivity.info/ ] of the blockchain transactions while ETH has 3%. Please note that this is just a comparison. Why EOS has such a massive share has probably much to do with how transactions are designed in EOS.  Cost: dApps built on ethereum need to spend ETH as Ethereum is proof of work currently. The price volatality of ETH stops one from spending it. The cost of transaction in EOS is adjusted by their inflation model. EOS do not charge a transaction fee. It's closer to how our current internet works. So users will be more inclined to use an EOS dApp in the long run as it is cheaper or free. We are currently starting to see this is the case.  Price stability: EOS/USD price is comparatively stable compared to BTC/USD or ETH/USD. Currently BTC is bullish and many alt coins followed suit while EOS is still $5-$8 rages.  EOS's design is more to do with holding it in your own wallet and using it than trading it on exchanges. With the new REX [ https://eosauthority.com/rex_history/ ] in action you can get \\u2018interest' by holding EOS. It's a reasonable passive income opportunity.  Security & Decentralization: Both, ETH's & EOS' security is provided by the network. ETH is protected by a global set of miners. But a miner with more resources can attach more hashpower and weaken the decentralization aspect of Ethereum. The network or an ETH holder cannot stop this from happening. It's the case with Bitcoin as 60% of the hashpower is controlled by just 5 people. EOS is a democratic system. The chain is protected by 21 voted block producers based on Delegated Proof of Stake [ https://twitter.com/mixdev/status/1143769516461023232 ]. Anyone holding EOS in their wallets can vote. A rogue block producer can be voted out simply by EOS account holders not voting them essentially kicking them out from the network. This will reinstate security of the blockchain. EOS has a potential problem of vote buying and other collusion channels. But the point is, the system has means to prevent or be offensive to those who act against the network; a feature Ethereum does not have.  Sustainability & Energy Efficiency: In a way, EOS is more sustainable than ETH. EOS is 17,236 times [ https://eosauthority.com/green/ ] more energy efficient than Ethereum.  EOS block producers run highly efficient server CPUs compared to high power GPUs or ASICs of ETH mining. This cuts down emissions as well as cost by a large margin.  If I have introduced errors, please do suggest edits."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "Currently, EOS is competing with Cardano, NEO, Elastos to dethrone Ethereum.  However, there is one large difference between these platforms. EOS and NEO are extremely centralized with only 21 consensus nodes while Cardano and Elastos are near infinitely decentralized through side-chains/off-chain/horizontal scaling.  This is the one big difference that decides everything, because anyone can build a centralized, highly scalable platform. You just pick a normal database and build on it. There is no challenge in that. The huge difficulty is decentralizing it.  Cardano and Elastos have managed to achieve that, EOS has not and its design prevents it from decentralizing in the future. Ethereum will roll out changes to their platform that makes it more scalable with Raiden Network and Casper.  Between Cardano and Elastos, they are very similar in scalability and decentralization, however Elastos, which is even more comprehensive and efficient than Cardano as a dapps platform.  So, it looks like Elastos is currently the best platform to dethrone Ethereum."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "In some ways EOS is better than Ethereum or any crypto for that matter, for instance:  1. Complete removal of transaction fees - for other cryptos the transaction fees is pretty high, but that's not the case with EOS. 2.

Evade issues concerning scalability like faced by BTC and ETH. 4. Using the proof-of-stake algorithm makes it faster, unlike the other cryptos that use proof-of-work which is slower.

These rules are laid by the users, which promotes governance.  \\u25cf A robust DApp ecosystem: EOS enables the users and other entities to build and work on a robust and resilient DApp system.  Some drawbacks for EOS:  \\u25cf DApp developers must pay for transaction bandwidth. With the increase in the number of transactions, bandwidth usage increases, leading to excessive cost demand.  \\u25cf The power flow is centralized to some extent in EOS, which means that it involves the issues of centralized systems like a single-point of failure, hacking, etc.  \\u25cf Block producer corruption is still a concern. As the blocks are being generated through block producers, so once a producer initiates the generation process, it can later corrupt the system for its own benefits.  \\u25cf Executing a large number of transactions concurrently; leads to the spamming issue of transactions, which is an ongoing issue."}, {"upvote": 5, "content": "Most likely it will when the market becomes bullish again and people start going to crypto exchanges like Binance, Primexbt, Kraken etc\\u2026 to buy heavily out of fomo.

While other platforms have different and, arguably, better ways of handling certain parts of the stack, the truth is that 90% of developers and businesses building new blockchain applications are going to do it on the Ethereum platform.  This is a building effect. More developers means more projects, which leads to people making better Dev tools and learning materials, which creates better opportunities to create applications, which creates more developers and projects\\u2026.

Even a killer platform that objectively is better than Ethereum on all fronts will have to overcome this network effect\\u2026 which is no easy task."}, {"upvote": 9, "content": "You could say it has 1 advantage with more scalability, but at a heavy price, because it chose to be permissioned and non-trustless instead of permissionless and trustless.  Here are the problems that EOS had only over the last week, because it's permissioned and non trustless.  1. ECAF ordered to freeze the hacked accounts, blockchain isn't immutable. many both inside and outside the EOS community aren't clear what ECAF, the main body tasked with resolving disputes between token holders on the network, is and what control it has over transactions. 2. Dan threw out the constitution because it was socially unscalable 3. RAM over-speculation, it currently costs $14 and growing to create an account. Whales cornered the RAM market. 4. Centralized - just 21 BP's that can vote each other in, plutocracy It takes just 17/21 BP to achieve consensus Block.one, who claimed to have no involvement in the launch of the EOS mainnet are now going to use the 10% of the token supply they own to influence the list of block producers. Dan also owns a large amount of the token supply and voting power Some of these block producer candidates in the top 10 came out of nowhere. How they got in the position they are in is pretty obvious \\u2013 they had a lot of tokens (or access to them) and voted themselves in. It's a whales' election. 5. BPs are already forming cartels. Many know each other from the video conference call. Cartel formation enables them to print money and keep themselves in power by voting for each other and buying votes. They can also censor or reverse transactions BP are accumulating EOS and it gives them a stronger vote over time. r/CryptoCurrency - EOS BP\\u00b4s already forming Cartels 6. If you dont vote within 3 years, your tokens get confiscated and redistributed too and you lose everything, can't just hold. (This rule has been removed) 7. An EOS BP is just a corporate-owned server. It can be shut down with a subpoena or by governments However, the biggest problem is simply that EOS is extremely centralized with only 21 consensus nodes and handpicked nodes, while other platforms like Cardano and Elastos are near infinitely decentralized through side-chains/off-chain/horizontal scaling or IOTA and Nano through simply a smart architecture.  It all comes down to being permissioned and non-trustless. That leads to the following, insurmountable problems.  1. 1 person is in charge and can change the constitution at will. This wouldn't be so bad in a trustless and permissionless platform, but wreaks havoc in a non trustless and permissioned platform. Also if it were several people in charge that have to write a constitution, it's even worse, because writing a constitution with many people is always victim of special interests, lobbying and the like. 2. A design that doesn't prevent cartel formation. Cartels always happen if it is possible. 3. If the security of a network relies on 1 person, it can't get mass adoption, because that person has to be perfect. Unfortunately, he isn't perfect, because he has made a very bad constitution. Thus, he isn't really good at that. Furthermore, he can never leave the project, can get sick, or die, because a complex constitution sometimes needs and update "}, {"upvote": 65, "content": " %3E Who would win, EOS Ichigo or EOS Kenpachi? EOS Ichigo probably still negs Kenpachi  I'll explain why, but before that\\u2026  Normally I would plug my servers but since a certain someone (Cough cough, Hanzo cough cough) always joins the Pure Boo server (Maybe from my links).  I'll only promote the Bleach scans server that we're working on.  https://discord.gg/TUMMcvpHbR And the KSI server too  https://discord.gg/8vAFUtSFQK So onto the answer LMAO.   Before I make this answer, I want to address something.  Ichigo did indeed get his powers back or at the very least his Quincy powers.  Not only that but Ichigo in TYBW got his Zanpakuto basically restored by Tsukushima.  Now, if you pay attention to the first scan for a bit.  He basically made a completely different and alternate past where Ichigo's Zangetsu was never destroyed, think about it like this.  Let's say there's a past, a past that can't change, or anything like that because it already happened, and in front of the past is an infinite amount of possibilities, and as Yhwach states, the future to him appears like sand.  As he states, he can just pluck one grain of sand and change that, so because of that, ALL of those future timelines have been affected by Yhwach, and in basically every since one of them, he's destroy Zangetsu.  So what Tsukushima does, is create an alternate past, where Zangetsu was never destroyed, basically making new infinite timelines that Yhwach has never affected yet.  Basically all of this allows Orihime to revert the sword back to it's original form.   Now to ACTUALLY get onto the answer.  Due to all of this, we can say that EOS Ichigo most likely wins.  He was low end relative to a Yhwach as he was able to harm EOS Ichigo in the fight  Not only that but in the fight, he was able to severely harm Yhwach too  Not only that but Yhwach himself compliments Ichigo  And in fact, he even broke Ichigo's Zangetsu because it might have been overpowered.  Kenpachi is strong in his own right, he's stated to basically be the strongest Soul Reaper  (Won't beat Ichigo but).  Still though, Kenpachi has some good feats, but EOS Ichigo was able to fight Yhwach and be lower end relative to him.  I don't see any way for Kenpachi to win.   So imo, EOS Ichigo wins.

It is a decentralized platform based blockchain and enables the users, organizations, and different entities to develop, and execute commercial-scale distributed and decentralized apps.

Moreover, the creators of EOS have also decided not to define this acronym and use it as it is formally. BlockOne has developed it; whereas, its core developer is BM (Daniel Larimer).  EOS has the ability to support all core and fundamental functionalities required by different businesses to enable themselves along with other people to make blockchain-based DApps in a similar fashion so that of the web-based applications.  These applications are hosted with functionalities like safe and sound access and authentication provisioning, permission, usage management, data hosting, and smooth communication between the end-users, DApp, and the Internet.  The EOS blockchain aims to build such a platform that can perform millions of transactions per second. These transactions are to be performed without any additional cost.  In EOS, blocks are produced by Block Producers, just like miners produce them in Ethereum. Once the blocks are generated, they are being paid by EOS blockchain instead of the users paying for them.  EOS blockchain system has a built-in inflation system that helps in the maintenance and proportion of an ecosystem. In EOS, two blocks are produced simultaneously every second.

I want to add a few more things:   * Just go out and take pictures. You just got your new camera and have no experience, and thus not really a clue of what you like to photograph. Take some time to discover what you actually like. Do you like portrets? Close-ups of insects? Wide landscapes? Action photo's of moving objects (like cars, people running)? Once you know what you like to do, you can read more about how to improve on that.  * Once you got your camera for a little while and have played with it, and know what you want, you will probably want to have some better equipment (that happened to me). Remember: a better lens is probably a better investment than a better camera. Two years ago I started with an EOS 100D, and I still have it.

"}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "If you're interested in creating high-quality images, then taking the time to learn about lighting and composition will help you in the long run. Make a habit of looking at lots of other peoples' photos. Also look at art - paintings and drawings.  When you look at an image and feel that you like it, try and ask yourself why you like it. Is it the colours? Is it a facial expression? Maybe it's a well-timed moment, like a passing bicycle with a nice background.  Looking at paintings and drawings you can ask the same questions, and observe how great artists have dealt with light and composition in the past.  The other thing to do is to take pictures. Take lots of pictures. Every day. Recently, I've been taking the camera with me while walking the dog, and in an hour's walk have often taken around 100 frames. Usually there are 2 or 3 of each subject.  One thing I've learned is to take more time if possible - I'm often shooting nature or urban subjects that aren't moving around much. Take the time to experiment with different viewpoints - don't take a quick snap and move on to something else. If you take a camera out with you every day to photograph your local area, you will start to understand how light and colour can change a great deal according to the time of day, and the time of year. So you can end up creating many pictures of the same subjects, but they will all be different in some way.  In this process of taking plenty of pictures as often as possible, you will quickly become familiar with the operation of your camera. You will also start to anticipate how well a particular scene will fit into a particular lens focal length. And you will start to know in advance how certain exposure settings will affect the final image.  I can recommend getting a mentor to help you along the way.

Compared to most other full -frame cameras, it is inexpensive. Canon's mirrorless lenses all test out as extremely sharp, so the camera takes great photos.

I have some EF glass, shoot mainly photos often in poor lighting, only dabble in video and really don't have the time nor the inclination to really do any post production editing. If you are NOT like me then the RP is a camera to keep at arms length especially if this is your first entry camera into a camera system.  I prefer to have a no nonsense camera that gives me quick results. I did the whole hobby photography thing when I was younger and identified myself with many of the review and YouTube vlogging crowd. Nowadays I simply don't have the patience to burn myself or my time in chasing the perfect image that no one cares about. Once in a while I and my family pull out the old laptop and go through the hundreds of photos and reminisce. We enjoy that.  I am keeping my 200D and plan on getting the EOS RP. I had a 6D mark 1 and from what I see the RP beats that. It beats the 200D handily in poor light. It beats the 200D in ergonomics. I'm set if I get the RP.  When I see the videos I shot I can't really tell the difference between 24 and 30 fps. I see a ton of YouTube videos and honestly 24 vs 30 fps is the last thing on my mind. Content is what I am looking for and there is only so much slow motion that a man can tolerate. I am happy with 1080 (24, 25 or 30 fps) with good content IN FOCUS with a little slo-mo when it helps to accentuate the story.  What about 4K? 4K is glorious but my computer is a middling day to day workhorse and loading a 10 minute 4k video on it would make it totter. A 30 minute timeline would drive it into the ground. I don't even have a 4K monitor and my cell phone is my max resolution screen.  If you are someone totally not like me and does a lot of really cool video on a current high end rig then a Sony would be a very good choice. Again video is a costlier rabbit hole than still photography. Your money, your effort, your choice. At this point I am assuming you want a camera than can do a lot of photography and some video. If you are a dedicated video guy you'll be laughing at the RP and considering the Sonys as entry level.  My 6D (mark 1) was bought by a professional wedding shooter. I asked him if he thought the specs were outdated as it is now a 10 year old model. He said his customers never ask - they just want a finished wedding album. Think about it - the camera does not make the photo, nor the video, the man does.  For the average camera user the RP is a great camera for someone who wants either wants more tinkering in editing or more video there are much better cameras but at a higher price point. I would have loved to have those better cameras but I thought about the new camera + new lenses + new computer + new learning for better images of the same subjects for the same amount of enjoyment and the equation did not work out. With the old lenses + new body + old computer + no extra effort I can decide to do things we enjoy more like taking a trip out of town or a dinner with friends or just peace of mind of a healthier wallet."}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "It depends on what kind of photography you do. It also depends on what kind of photographer you are.  -  Personally I chose to go with the EOS R over the EOS RP, but I know of one professional photographer in Hawaii who uses the EOS RP for weddings.  The EOS RP was not an option for me for a few reasons\\u2026.  - EOS R uses the same LP-E6N batteries as my Canon 5D Mk4, EOS RP uses a completely different battery  - EOS R has a max shutter speed of 1/8000 sec, EOS RP has a max shutter speed of 1/4000 sec  - EOS R can use a battery grip, EOS RP doesn't have any battery grip option  - EOS R has USB 3.1 (5Gb/sec), EOS RP has USB 2.0 (480Mb/sec)  - EOS R has 24fps for video, EOS RP does not (unless you shoot cropped 4k) (that may have been addressed in a firmware update, not positive)  - EOS R is 30MP, EOS RP is 26MP - not as drastic as some of the other differences but if I'm getting a new camera I'd rather the sensor be equal to or greater than the 5D Mk4.  - EOS R allows you to use custom filenames, EOS RP does not. I shoot with two bodies and each body is capable of using a different filename.  Those are my personal reasons not to go with the EOS RP. But as I said earlier, there are people who use it professionally, so there's nothing wrong with the camera at all.  Now I'm using the EOS R3 which is only 24MP and adapting to the lower resolution (after shooting the 45MP EOS R5 since it was released). There are no bad cameras out there.

I have not personally used one or even had a good look at the specs to see if it would be worth me considering buying one. However IF I were looking to buy a New Canon Camera then I would certainly be considering one rather seriously.  A couple of years ago I bought an Olympus Mirrorless Camera as I wanted to see first hand just how good this Mirrorless Thing could be. I was initially disappointed but with some encouragement from Dave Hanie and the purchase of a better Prime lens and things started to look up a bit. However to get the best out of the Olympus it takes a lot of Learning and that includes multiple readings of the Manual as well as a lot of fiddling with the camera and many hours spent running through the Menu so as one knows where to find stuff if and when the need arises.  I would imagine that the Canon RP would take some time to learn the ways of the beast and so those who are taking the negative approach and pushing the Sony products may well have never used a Canon RP and are into Justifying what they have purchased for themselves. The specs don't mean all that much as IF you work with your gear instead of working against it them amazing things are possible. There is a tendency to blame the Camera when one chooses the wrong settings and it all turns to Crap.  I have fond memories of a complete melt down over trying to shoot fireworks with my Olympus and I could not find out where to switch off the Autofocus. Then when I did find it I had to select Auto Focus Off and then press OK and who forgot to press OK and so the Autofocus was still working and so Is that the Camera's fault.

Now the question is why do people say that this camera has poor specs? Because people only focus on specs and not on what they can do with the camera. I have seen about 99% of the time camera is better than the photographer who uses it. Several decades ago when I was starting out with manual focus SLRs, I was hoping that a better camera will help me overcome my deficiencies. Alas, that's what all photographers think ie. they need a camera which can magically make them better without they learning to become great.  People may say this camera has got still photo shooting burst rate of 5 frames per second. I use a Canon EOS 1DXII which is canon's top of the line still photography camera. However, I rarely use 12fps burst. I shoot a max of 2\\u20133 frames at a time. If you know what you are doing, then you don't need to adopt the spray and pray mode ie keep on pushing the shutter button and hoping that one shot will be great.  If I have to do street shooting or kind of mountain climbing then this kind of small and light body will help.  Every camera company has to differentiate their offerings and keep some of the top notch specs for their high end bodies. Else, why will anyone buy a high end body? If you can extract every drop of juice from this body, then you can become a great photographer and then obviously you can buy the other expensive cameras.

Good enough to be what is likely the most common camera for working event photographers currently in use.  Good enough for a professional to shoot pro sports.  Good enough for top wedding photographers.  The only more popular Canon camera on Flickr is the Rebel T3i, which is probably about 1/10th the price - and only by a small margin. The most popular Nikon camera on Flickr, the D7000, has approximately 3/4 the users of the 5DIII - and it too is a small fraction of the cost.  What about upstart Sony? The a6000 and A7 have been turning heads!  Well, the a6000, Sony's most popular camera, has been doing quite well. It has almost a quarter as many users as the venerable 5DIII.  The A7? Just over 1/8th.   But we all know that the most popular isn't the best, right?  Is it the best?  Perhaps not. Is it a bit behind the cutting edge in sensor technology? Yep. Do current Nikons have better dynamic range? Yep.  Do current Nikons focus better? That's arguable but is at worst a coin flip for Nikon. Nikon's sensors have been better for a couple of generations now.   So what gives?  If the Nikon is better in a number of ways, why is the Canon so popular, even long past the peak of its popularity, at a time when many people are jumping ship to Sony or Fuji or Nikon for various reasons, all of which are completely legitimate?  In short, it's a damn fine camera. Greater than the sum of its parts, because it's not just a body that makes the camera.  The image quality might be a bit behind the latest and greatest, but it's still superb.  The focusing system may be a touch less capable, but it's still fantastic.  The camera might not have wifi, or a touchscreen, but the controls it has are ideal for many - there's a reason stodgy old Canon makes very few changes to their control layout - it is preferred by many - perhaps most. Is it an interesting camera to those that are focused on the technology aspect of photography? Not in the least.   The 5DIII was a groundbreaking camera when it came out. Today, it is still so popular, because it is still superb. It's not the best any more, but it performs close enough to the best that many, many people still use it, and many more will use them for 5+ years to come.  It might look like a dinosaur compared to the latest mirrorless cameras, but that is not in capability, only in technology.  And if you used both, you'd probably find the 5DIII better than every mirrorless camera money can buy for a variety of things, even today. That list is shrinking, but it's still not insignificant."}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "Yes, it is a really great choice even today, in 2021, when is going on 9 years old.

For me going to full frame was a massive upgrade, even though the 7D is an excellent camera. I had the 7D for around two years, and learned absolutely everything I could about lenses and my technique. At that point I was then shooting professionally, and starting to hit the limits of the camera. I found that in low light, particularly for video I was getting a lot of noise. For that reason I decided to upgrade.  I disagree a bit with people who say don't worry about your tools, concentrate on your technique and ability. This is true, however the tool you use will at some point impact what you are trying to do. This is especially the case if you are charging money for your work. I have watched another photographer spend hours upon hours in Lightroom and Photoshop editing wedding photos taken using a kit lens and a crop camera. I can shoot on my full frame camera with a good L lens and barely have to do any correction at all. The difference is obvious, and it is real.  I suppose my point is, yes, do upgrade, but do it at the right time. Do it when you know you have hit the limit of your gear and you need something better. I recently saw a post on reddit where a photographer was wanting advice on upgrading from a 5Dmk3 to either a 1Dxmk2 or a 5Dsr. Apart from the fact that those are two very different cameras, there was no real justification for it, other than wanting to spend money because there is something out there that is \\u2018better'.  I think initially it's easy to fall into gear acquisition syndrome, buying lenses and cameras because of reviews online where someone has shot 100 photos against a brick wall. At some point you will know your own gear, know what you like, and know what works for you. This will only come by practice and spending time out shooting photos. I use a Canon 24\\u2013105 f4 IS L for instance. If you look online you will find that lots of people say it's not a great lens. In my case, I actually sold the objectively better 24\\u201370 2.8 to get it. The reality of carrying around a massive heavy lens for my every day shooting just didn't work. The 24\\u2013105 was much lighter, had IS for video, and if I needed to shoot in low light, I just put on one of my lightweight primes. Now if I was shooting weddings all day that might be a different matter, but I'm not.

Depend on way you looked at it, it is basically Rebel with more features, or x0D with more Rebel like UI and limited custom function and less accessory options.  Personally, if you are not too sure about going for consumer DSLR or going for more prosumer or enthusiast body, I would think you are better off getting Rebel line of products for your first DSLR and use extra money on lens and other accessory. 77D is type of body that born out of compromise, and that is serving fairly specific niche group of users in mind.

I think EOS will launch mid year and multiple groups will spin up public blockchains and it may get messy. People say eventually the public will consolidate on one but my guess is that this will not happen for a while. Also I think some things wont go as expected (they never do), and the EOS team will have to iterate and improve the protocol. That said, they do have a talented/experienced team and a war chest worth billions of dollars, so I do have faith for them to build a great product in the long run. If you want to know more about EOS, here is a short description and unbiased review I made of the project!  EOS is a really promising and exciting 3rd generation blockchain platform that is slated to compete with the likes of Ethereum, NEO, Cardano, etc. They have novel (and experimental) approaches to the problems plaguing gen 2 blockchains - scalability, interoperability, and governance. EOS is targeting its official launch in mid 2018 and at that point we'll be able to see if their choices of on-chain governance (voting), 21 block producers, 0 transaction fees, parallel processing, etc. will actually work in practice.  I actually did a deep dive of this project and covered the Pros AND the Cons of it in the following unbiased review video (I do not currently own any EOS). I would really appreciate it if you gave it a quick watch and let me know your thoughts on it!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7nw4Ye1VYw "}, {"upvote": 6, "content": "EOS Price Prediction 2018 \\u2013 2020  EOS current price is more than $4.50 which is growing very fast and people are investing in EOS Crypto everyday. Price movement is so smooth and continuous specially from November 2017. There are big investment opportunities, if you are waiting or searching for a coin which can give you decent profit then i will say it is Iota and EOS.  According to analyst and previous records of crypto coins we can forecast that EOS price will more than $20 in 2018. Its just a minimum amount may be price touch $100 peak. But i am sure it will not go down in 2018 reason behind this is that EOS crypto is very hot coin for investors and investors are deciding to invest in it due to low price and low risk. As i mentioned price is more than $4.50 and less than $5 right now. So it is not a big amount we can easily buy more than 100 coins right now with very low capital if we compare it with bitcoin.  EOS price prediction 2018 is that EOS coin will at $20. EOS price prediction for 2020 is that EOS coin will touch $150 very easily. There is very less risk if you invest right now as compare to bitcoin or Ethereum.  hope it helps  source: EOS Price Prediction 2018-2020 [ http://www.thenexttechs.com/eos-price-prediction-2018/ ]"}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "As high as possible as I have some haha.

You can make your research and if you find the platform deem fit then you can go ahead just like i did.  When it was first launched, the price of the EOS cryptocurrency sat at $2.29. However, it then doubled in less than 24 hours, with EOS hitting $5.40.  This hike did not last, however, and the coin soon started falling, breaking one support level after another. EOS found its bottom at $0.59, which is where it remained until late October 2017. Once the crypto bull run that marked the year reached its peak, EOS joined the rally, and it skyrocketed to $16.39 on January 13, 2018.  However, while most coins peaked around this date or earlier, EOS' all-time high came later, in April 2018. In mid-April, the crypto market \\u2013 which had been crashing since January \\u2013 started seeing a new bullish wave. Prices started going up, and many assumed that the so-called 'crypto winter' was over.  These days, we know that the surge in April was only the eye of the storm, as the crash continued as May 2018 arrived. But, for those few weeks, the EOS price jumped once more, breaking its former record, and going up to $22.89. This was the coin's highest price, and it has never reached these highs again, at least so far.  Following this second surge, EOS kept dropping, briefly stopped by support here and there, but eventually, it dropped to its new bottom at $1.86 around December 7, 2018. In 2019, the coin saw gradual growth, although it progressed slowly, and everything it had achieved by mid-2019 was undone in the second half of the year, as it slowly returned to the level where it sat ever since \\u2013 between $2 and $2.8.  The EOS price has fluctuated in this range, except for on three occasions in 2020. The first one was between mid-January and mid-February, when it joined another bull run that took it to $5.35. The second was in August 2020, when it hit $3.7, and the last one is right now, led by Bitcoin (BTC), which is once again approaching its all-time highs at $20,000.  EOS, on the other hand, is as far away from its own record as it can be, hovering around $3.26.  What is happening to EOS these days?  Unfortunately, EOS has not been making headlines in 2020, as the crypto industry is mostly focused on the decentralised finance (DeFi) sector. When DeFi started slowing down, bull runs took over, and most of the attention went to Bitcoin.  However, that does not mean that EOS has been doing nothing. Its developers at Block.one recently announced the EOS Resource Model proposal, and the soon-to-arrive review of various talented organisations that responded to the company's invitation to evaluate their code.  Block.one also recently expressed its pleasure with how Spielworks built a rewards and loyalty platform for gamers using EOSIO.  The company also worked on adding new features to its Training and Certification segment of the blockchain.  And, of course, as a development platform, EOS has also been making moves to attract people to develop new DeFi projects on its network. The network already has quite a few successful projects, although the majority of the developers are still focusing on developing DeFi on Ethereum.  EOS price prediction 2021: what to expect from EOS going forward?  Lastly, we arrive at the most interesting part \\u2014 EOS coin price prediction for 2021 and beyond.  According to TradingBeasts, the EOS price in December 2020 will reach a maximum of $3.4, after which the forecasting service expects it to drop back down to $2.7, on average.  In January 2021, its EOS crypto price prediction shows the coin remaining near this level, at around $2.7, later expecting it to experience a slow but steady rise throughout the year, with the coin having the potential to hit a high of $3.9 next December. The average price of EOS is predicted to reach $4.07 in December 2022, and then $5.03 in December 2023.  Wallet Investor also expects the currency's price to rise in early 2021, although their EOS coin forecast says that the asset will see a price crash in the second half of the year. The event will potentially lead EOS down to $1.2 one year from now.  As for CryptoGround, they have a very bullish EOS prediction. In fact, their EOS forecast claims that the coin will simply keep climbing, with its value reaching $4.17 in six months, $4.7 in one year, and $21.4 by December 2025."}, {"upvote": 10, "content": "There are over 18,000 Cryptocurrency tokens in existence as of March 2022.

The Canon 80-D has been replaced by the 90-D which is a high end Cropped Sensor Camera which works well for long shots like Birding but does not do Wide as well as what the full Frame Canon 6-D Mk11 is capable of. So once again which sort of shots are you planning on using the gear for. Full Frame does better Milky Way shots at night.  For me it is a No Contest as I would pick the 6-D for what I do every time and yes it does work much better with expensive lenses which are also rather heavy and so there is that. I would also mention that sitting opposite the 6-D is the new Canon R series Mirrorless Camera which in my humble opinion is about a Grand Overpriced and so are the new lenses that are designed for those camera's But in the lead up to Christmas we saw Canon reducing the prices by almost the number that I mentioned so maybe those deals are still around somewhere.

You cannot get a specific answer with a generic question. I have just bought a 6D Mark II. I have had the original 6D for nearly three years. I shoot live music in mostly small, badly lit venues. When I bought the 6D it was Canon's best low-light camera (even better than the 5D MkII and 1DX). It was also very affordable for someone who makes very little money working in a sector with very little money. It was an upgrade from a 550D (APS-C). I had one EF-S lens for that camera \\u2013 a Tamron 17\\u201350 f/2.8 that was my go to lens. My 70\\u2013200 f/2.8 was an EF. When I upgraded, I bought a used Canon 24\\u201370 f/2.8, and a friend sold me his 16\\u201335mm f/2.8 at a bargain price. I now had a full range of full-frame lenses that I needed for the 6D. That camera has now taken close 30k photos, but no video, so I was feeling the need to get a new body (as in camera, although the physical one could do with an upgrade too) when the EOS-R was announced. Personally, I'm not overly convinced about the hype over mirrorless cameras (I do have an EOS M2 as a pocket camera), probably because I have been using an SLR since the 1970s and they have never failed, and I mostly see mirrorless as a marketing ploy to sell more gear.  I looked at the same options you have asked about and asked myself if I wanted to use a body almost identical to the one I was currently familiar with, but upgraded, or go for a new technology with a new lens mount. I then looked at my bank account and prices of the two options. I found a new 6D MkII and battery grip for under \\u00a31100. It was not a difficult decision at that point. A new camera body that would use all my existing lenses without needing an adaptor, and without the need to familiarise myself with a new body and way of working, as well as using a new system in its first iteration that would need regular firmware updates. During my next upgrade cycle I may opt for the EOS-R as all the bugs will have been sorted, and my lenses will probably need upgrading as well by then.  So, as you can see, there is no definitive answer. My advice is to never buy a camera purely from the spec sheets, or people's reviews either. You need to actually hold them in your hands and use them in the situation you intend to use them most. Don't buy a camera that is over-specced for what you are shooting. For example, do you really need a full-frame camera? If you mostly want to shoot video, would an actual video camera serve you better? And always look at your budget, and don't spend more than you need to, especially if it's a hobby.

All else being equal, a crop sensor camera is going to be better if you are mostly doing sports or wildlife photography \\u2014 the higher frame rate is better for action photography, and the crop factor gives your telephoto lenses extra reach.

Iota IOTA doesn't offer what Ardor offers yet (BaaS), so it is a competitor to EOS. Beyond everything that EOS offers, Iota offers decentralized storage, Oracles and cloud computing.  While Iota is already worth $5B, they are a juggernaut and they will most likely make Bitcoin a run for the money soon. There is a lot of criticism towards Iota because it currently uses a coordinator to verify transaction before there are more nodes on the network, at which point it can be removed. 2. Skycoin Beyond being a BaaS like Ardor, Skycoin offers decentralized storage, smart contracts and complete privacy. Finally, it offers the completely decentralized internet, Skywire, which might be bigger than all cryptocurrencies combined. They just launched the testnet for Skywire a week ago. 3.

An EOS BP is just a corporate-owned server. It can be shut down with a subpoena or by governments However, the biggest problem is simply that EOS is extremely centralized with only 21 consensus nodes and handpicked nodes, while other platforms like Cardano and Elastos are near infinitely decentralized through side-chains/off-chain/horizontal scaling or IOTA and Nano through simply a smart architecture.  It all comes down to being permissioned and non-trustless. That leads to the following, insurmountable problems.  1. 1 person is in charge and can change the constitution at will. This wouldn't be so bad in a trustless and permissionless platform, but wreaks havoc in a non trustless and permissioned platform. Also if it were several people in charge that have to write a constitution, it's even worse, because writing a constitution with many people is always victim of special interests, lobbying and the like. 2. A design that doesn't prevent cartel formation. Cartels always happen if it is possible. 3. If the security of a network relies on 1 person, it can't get mass adoption, because that person has to be perfect. Unfortunately, he isn't perfect, because he has made a very bad constitution. Thus, he isn't really good at that. Furthermore, he can never leave the project, can get sick, or die, because a complex constitution sometimes needs and update "}, {"upvote": 128, "content": "Why Buy Litecoin?  There are three core factors that differentiate Litecoin from Bitcoin and they are transaction speed, mining ease, and numeric appeal.  PLEASE NOTE: With the current bearish behaviour of all cryptocurrencies, many of us have fallen into fake cryptocurrency HYIP where you are promised double of your money in a short period of time and ignoring the few legitimately registered investment platforms like CRYPTOEXCHANGEFX, CRYPTOBROKER.STORE, etc due to that low return rate. This cryptocurrency scams are in no way helping the cryptocurrency world to grow and i won,t stop advocating for the future of cryptocurrency because i believe it is the future. Check out the few legit investment platforms i listed above on Google and thank me later for saving your asses for good.  1. Transaction Speed  It takes Bitcoin roughly 10 minutes to create a block and complete a transaction. Litecoin, on the other hand, produces blocks in only 2.5 minutes.  In 2017, Litecoin introduced an even faster way to process transactions called SegWit, which stands for Segregated Witness. SegWit essentially introduces blocks that can accommodate more transactions with them. The first SegWit payment was made on May 11th and successfully completed a transaction from Zurich to San Francisco in less than a second.  The speed of transaction definitely secures Litecoin's status as more of a utility when compared to Bitcoin, and it will likely get the attention of merchants who strongly prefer fast transactions over slower, more complicated ones.  2. Clear Leadership  Litecoin was created by Charlie Lee, who has supervised the development and evolution of Litecoin. Charlie Lee promotes LTC as a complementary cryptocurrency to Bitcoin and not a competitor. More importantly, Charlie Lee has been able to be the face of Litecoin in a way that Bitcoin has never had. As the Managing Director of the Litecoin Foundation, he oversees the development of the Litecoin cryptocurrency which shows a very clear leadership structure for those investing.  3. Merchant Appeal  Bitcoin will cap its circulation at 21 million and Litecoin at 84 million. This means that with more and more people investing in the currencies, at some point goods with smaller price tags will be charged at decimals. A book, for example, ends up costing 0.00009 BTC (Bitcoin).  That's not a very consumer-friendly number, and it will only become more difficult to distinguish or even understand these decimal price tags. With a significantly larger circulation cap \\u2014 four times that of Bitcoin \\u2014 Litecoin prevents this decimal effect from happening anytime soon.  When Is The Best Time To Buy Litecoin?  Litecoin has the potential to grow exponentially. In fact, with a couple of exceptions, Litecoin's price has toed the line with Bitcoin's price, says Investopedia's Rakesh Sharma. And so far, only 64% of Litecoin's 84 million coins have been released into circulation, with roughly 30 million to go.  Judging by Litecoin's growth in 2017 with gains of over 7,000 percent according to Fortune, the time to buy Litecoin, or to start diversifying your cryptocurrency wallet, might be now.

I'll been needing to live with it for a good year :-)  I'm actually really happy to see the Canon EOS R5. I left Canon back in 2018, mostly because I was getting more out of my Olympus gear. I grokked the whole mirrorless thing, found it better than optical. I could actually use my old manual lenses much more effectively than on an DSLR.  But part of it was their basic attitude. Kasey Stern, the genius behind the Camera Conspiracies vlog, pretty much expressed my main problem with Canon. It was absolutely clear, over the years, that Canon was arbitrarily holding back the level of technology on lower-end cameras to sell higher-end cameras\\u2026 regardless of the actual cost of those features. If you're the only camera company in the world and doing that, maybe that's okay. But they were not\\u2026. there are other camera companies.  So in 2015, I had bought a few Olympus Micro Four Thirds cameras, which I was using as a secondary system\\u2026 for when I didn't want to drag along my 10kg+ Canon system. I bought the OM-D E-M5 Mark II that year. First thing to note was that, even thought this was a mid-range camera, they didn't reduce features in any way that wasn't an obvious additional expense. In fact, they introduced a bunch of new features on this model that the flagship OM-D E-M1 didn't do. A year later, they introduced a new flagship, the OM-D E-M1 Mark II, with a bunch of new features. Not long after, they put out an update that added some of those new features \\u2014 those that would reasonably work \\u2014 for my E-M5 Mark II.   Canon, on the other hand, intentionally crippled their lower-end models to drive higher-end sales. And perhaps, in a different way, they also kind of decided, for the photographer, various limits of the camera that were not necessarily natural. Their old behavior was to cripple a bunch of things. So I had a Canon 60D and added a 6D. The 60D, a much lower cost camera, had a far, far better autofocus system. They could have put something at least that good into the 6D for very little extra money, but they were more concerned about the 6D/5D competition than Nikon or anyone else competing with their offerings.  This was all through the camera, including a bunch of things that were 100% software-bases, just there to crapify the 6D versus the 5D. When you're invested in any system \\u2014 camera or otherwise \\u2014 you have a vested interest. And if you're an internet writer or pundit, your first impulse is to support and defend the things your excellent brain has found to be the best. Unfortunately, as a full-time engineer and only hobby photographer, it was all too easy for me to see how that cripple hammer had been applied. And once you get involved with a company that doesn't do that, even a little bit; a company that's actually adding new high-end features to your mid-range camera, you have a hard time sticking with the old guys.  So I was really excited to see the EOS R5. Of course, since I have not used this camera, I had to give you all my ideas here rather than a real review. But also, I'm hoping this goes beyond the R5 and changes the way Canon is thinking. I knew Canon had some technology issues\\u2026 here, they've solved that a bit, but they're also leaving it up to the user how they'd like to deal with camera limitations. As a result, you have limited features not offered by anyone else.   I noticed back in 2018 how Canon was going about their EOS R business. They introduced the original EOS R as a low-cost mirrorless, relative to the EOS 5D Mark IV, that had the same sensor and, ideally, same image quality. But they crippled it a bit, to ensure it wasn't quite a pro-grade match to the 5D. And yet, that also made it cheaper.  So get inside Canon's head for a moment. The EOS R was not all that well received, but I got the idea right away. Sony was drinking Canon's milkshake as photographers and videographers started to really get the idea of mirrorless camera advantages. When they introduced the R, they introduced three different EF to RF adapters. So any old Canon shooter could buy an EOS R, a lens adapter, and pretty much pretend they had a mirrorless Canon EF camera. The key here: you could buy a Sony, buy a Metabones adapter, but you still have a Sony\\u2026 it doesn't work as fast with your EF lenses, it doesn't use your batteries, it doesn't use your speedlights. So Canon was wise: the EOS R's only purpose was to stop the bleeding.  Next thing was glass. The reason Canon and Nikon had 80\\u201390% of the pro SLR and DSLR market for 50 years was that they had huge collections of lenses. As nice as a new camera might be, if you can't get the lens you need, fuggetaboudit! And yet, Canon offered those three adapters\\u2026. no worries.  No worries unless, like Canon, you're trying to launch a new system. Nikon went there\\u2026 Nikon didn't do all that well with the Z system, despite making excellent gear. My contention was simple: you can't make a new system for new users if you're Canon or Nikon. As with the EOS R, you make a camera that's kind of a no-brainer for existing users.  But here's the thing: let's assume I still have my EOS 6D. I go and buy an EOS R, I buy the basic adapter, and I'm golden, right\\u2026 I have a mirrorless Canon EF camera. I'm good, but Canon isn't\\u2026 they'd rather me be an EOS EF user than a Sony user, but what they'd really like is for me to be an EOS R user, cemented in place. That only happens if my next lens buys are RF lenses, not EF lenses, despite the fact they can't work on my other cameras.  So Canon did another cool thing: rather than try to flesh out their RF lens line with the basic set of EF clones they'd need to sell EOS R system cameras, they made hero lenses. The first RF lenses were insanely good lenses. So were the next few. This was brilliant \\u2014 anyone buying that one EOS R body was potentially sucked in for those lenses. This was absolutely an unusual move: Canon was delivering lenses that average folks couldn't afford, but they were selling dreams to their professional user base.   So even without having an R5 in my hands, I know enough about it to know that this completes the circle. This is the pro body that everyone who flirted with EOS R \\u2014 pretty much all pros and well-heeled enthusiasts \\u2014 wanted. And more.  Canon launched the video on a DSLR thing with the Canon 5D Mark II. Okay, sure, Nikon got there a few months before with 720; video, but Canon really sold it. And I think a big part of that, early on, as Vincent Laforet's 5D Mark II short film Reverie\\u2026 anyone who used digital camera for video back then simply knew this film was impossible. But after the 5D Mark II \\u2014 half of which were sold for video use \\u2014 Canon lost steam in the DSLR-for-video market. Why? Well, heck, Canon has been one of the Big Four in camcorders\\u2026 so they built Cinema EOS, a line of much more expensive cinema cameras that used regular EF lenses. And so regular EOS product line cameras had to get the cripple hammer.. you wouldn't want someone buying a $750, $1500, or $3000 camera that fits their needs if maybe you can sell 10% of those buyers on a $10,000+ camera that does it all\\u2026. at least, that seemed to be the logic.   So now the R5 is kind of a return to the 5D Mark II\\u2026 no artificial limitations, far as I can tell. And even IBIS \\u2014 Canon's the last one to the party on that, and I'm a bit skeptical that they can match Olympus on their first try, but I've found it critical for my own shooting.

Do not get this line of thinking stuck in your head because it's not entirely true. In fact, to be honest, this statement is used many times by people who simply can't afford good gear and are jealous at those who can. If you can't afford good gear right now, that's fine; work with what you can afford and save up money to grow into better gear over time. The best camera is always the one you have with you and by this I mean, if you own a $6,500 Canon 1DX and it's sitting at home, your best camera may be the free one that came built into the phone in your pocket!  While it is true, skill is the most important aspect of almost anything, including photography, your gear and even more specifically, your lenses, are just as important. A good lens on an inexpensive camera is always better than a cheap lens on an expensive camera. If you're just starting out and looking for a camera for a beginner, try to think about what sort of photography you'll be doing. General photography such as family photos, photos of your friends, pets, etc.; landscape photography; wildlife photography; street photography, etc. If you don't know yet, that's okay but if you have a goal of developing skills specific to one of these styles, it will help with camera selection.  When getting started, I'd get something inexpensive but not so cheap that your photo quality ends up discouraging you altogether (again, this is where the \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" nonsense kicks in.) I'll cover a couple types and why they're good starter cameras. And with any camera you choose, always try to keep the camera out of \\\"automatic mode\\\" if possible so you begin to master the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  Point-and-Shoot or Camera Phone  These cameras are very inexpensive and with the newer smartphones, the camera is built right in and often takes better photos than the DSLR's from just a few years ago! This is the most inexpensive route to take (and may not cost a penny if you use the camera on your phone) and it helps you learn about composition, lighting, etc. If you're already past this point and want a camera you can grow into, the following are good options:  Traditional SLR's  I know, this is probably not what most people think of when deciding on a beginner's camera but I want to mention it because if you have one of these lying around in your house (parent's or grandparent's old camera, etc.), they're great for learning the basics of a camera with all of the digital stuff removed. SLR (single lens reflex) cameras aren't used much anymore because of the cost of operation, decreased photo quality, and lack of film processing labs, however, I think any aspiring photographer should own or at least use one because they are the \\\"original camera\\\", they are inexpensive, and they help give you a greater appreciation for the luxury of digital photography (not limited to 24-36 photos per roll, immediate results where you can see your photo seconds after taking it, easy and fast multiple frame shooting, and no cost by ruining a roll of film or wasting it on bad photos.) If you buy a traditional SLR 35mm camera, I'd go for something like the Nikon 35mm F2AS with a 50mm \\\"prime lens\\\", or similar. Here's a photo of one of mine:  Digital SLR's  Digital SLR's, or DSLR's, have been the most popular choice for many years now, they're easy to find used, and they're a good starting point in learning photography. These cameras are basically digital versions of the original SLR camera but offer much more flexibility and many more options. Whagt we're seeing right now, however, is a switch from DSLR's to \\\"mirrorless cameras\\\", including the very popular \\\"Micro Four Thirds\\\" cameras which use a smaller sensor, yet often outperform the DSLR's. I'll touch on those, below. Anyway, an inexpensive or used DSLR is a good choice for starting out and I'd recommend an entry level Canon DSLR such as one of the \\\"Rebel\\\" series cameras. I currently use a Canon 1DX which is NOT a beginner's camera, and my old Canon 5D Mark II (this is a great beginner's camera, easy to find, and inexpensive.) Here's a photo of the Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm prime lens attached:  Mirrorless Cameras  These cameras really are \\\"the future of photography\\\" although many professional photographers would scoff at you for even suggesting such a thing because just as it was when SLR's were phasing out, DSLR using pro's often get stuck in their ways and refuse to move with the times. Even today there are professional photographers who refuse to switch from SLR to DSLR! Mirrorless cameras are superior to DSLR's in almost every way: They have higher resolution (megapixels) for a fraction of the cost of DSLR's; there's no mirror flapping around making noise and causing camera vibration; they're smaller and easier to carry, many can shoot 4K and even Cinema 4K video (while Canon and Nikon refuse to adapt and offer this feature for a reasonable price in their DSLR's); and overall, they're less expensive. If you can afford one (they're often cheaper than many new DSLR's), go for it! I currently shoot with a Panasonic Lumix GH4 because I shoot photography AND I need to shoot 4K video and this camera does both. An even less expensive alternative is the Lumix GH3 which sells for around $500, a quarter of the price of the GH4. Here's a photo of the Lumix GH4, a \\\"mirrorless camera\\\":  Regardless of what you choose, unless it's a cheap $30 point-and-shoot or your phone's camera, try to make a decision on which camera format you want to grow into, otherwise you'll be wasting money on a camera and the expensive lenses that you'll end up not using when you switch to a different format.  Taking an introductory photography class or workshop is also a good idea when getting started as you'll more quickly learn the basics including aperture, exposure, shutter speed, composition, and editing.

But even so, I don't consider myself to be a professional.  To me, the word professional is very ambiguous. The real meaning of the word \\\"professional\\\" is that you are making a living out of your photography, so in this case the camera must be able to produce photos with image quality that surpass the minimum photo-publishing requirements. In this case, a 700D with its 18MP Canon sensor that's also being used in the 7D meets the requirement, as the image quality produced by the 700D will satisfy at the very least the minimum standard requirement of many photographers; so it's safe to say it's good enough to be considered a \\\"professional camera\\\". A lot of low-budget studios where I live, which I consider to be professional photography studio, even still use the good-old 500D for passport headshots and similar stuffs, and they make money from it; that makes the 500D a \\\"professional camera\\\". I'm pretty sure that the photos from the 700D are also good enough to even get pass the very strict requirement of a lot of professional stock photography agencies. So there's that one kind of professional.    On the other hand, the assumed meaning of the word \\\"professional camera\\\" that the camera manufacturers and marketing departments tried to emphasize to us is the camera with the most feature packed with a very high price-level. Well, in this case, the 700D is not a professional camera, and the manufacturer will push you towards a 7D, 5D or 1D, in hope that you'll buy those products with a much higher margin to both cover the operational cost of the manufacturer and make more profit for the company. They don't care if you make a living out of your camera or not, but the 7D, 6D, 5D, and 1D are professional cameras. That's another kind of professional.  Now let's discuss the 700D specifically. I don't personally own the 700D but I used to own a 650D for one year, and it's spec'ed very similar to the 700D. The 650D/700D can shoot 18MP RAW or JPEG with a CMOS sensor that's very similar to the sensor on the high-end Canon 7D. It does shoot at 4 or 5fps burst image, it shoot 30fps video at 1080p, it has a decent viewfinder, and a good all-around control as well as menu.   Upgrading from a 650D/700D to a 7D, a \\\"professional\\\" camera, will give you faster burst image at 8fps, weather-sealing, better view-finder, more extensive manual control, and a heavier body. But it will not give you a better image quality.   Upgrading to a 5D Mark III will give you a somewhat cleaner image quality at high ISO, better control, better viewfinder, weather-sealing, better video output, but you're back with 5fps burst speed, and you'll have to invest to full-frame lenses.   Upgrading to 1D, you'll get 7D fast-performance with an almost-5D-like image quality, but it'll cost you as much as a used decent car.  Now the important question that you'll have to ask for yourself is: will you make more money if you have a 7D, 6D, 5D, or a 1D? Maybe yes, maybe no. But one thing for sure, you'll have to spend more money to buy those cameras than if you buy the 700D. Can you justify that? Do you really need to have those features on those so-called professional cameras, or can you live with just the features on the 700D?  I personally don't give too much thought about using the so-called professional cameras. As long as I can deliver the results needed by the clients or by yourself, I think I'm happy. My 650D could deliver the result that I require back then, and to my book, it's good enough. I don't know about you, nor do I know about your photography requirement, so I can't speak for you.

David Thorpe is an ex-photojournalist from UK, a true professional photographer in my opinion.

And it was on the Sureshot that the pic was made.  That makes it a professional camera in my book. Cameras are not professional, people are.

"}, {"upvote": 16, "content": "It's a decent start, but it also tells you a few things about Canon's thinking right now. And I think they made some good decisions, and a few bad ones that may have not been choices as much as technical limitations.  Neither Canon nor Nikon were actually new to mirrorless with last August's introductions. But the R and the Z are professional formats, even if the first models are not a match for the top-of-the-line DSLRs yet. Both Canon and Nikon took on the idea that mirrorless was something less than DSLR, a step between DSLR and compact digital cameras (aka point and shoot). Nikon's 1 system used the same 1\\u2033 sensor size found in high-end P&S cameras like the Sony RX10 and RX100. But Canon put out a very compact APS-C system with their EOS M. And a funny thing happened: while Nikon's 1 system is now defunct, the EOS M is very popular, albeit not necessarily in the USA. Canon's been the #2 mirrorless brand in Japan in 2016 and 2017 (BCN rankings, second to Olympus) and looks to be taking the #1 spot for the 2018 year\\u2026 without even counting the EOS R. Canon seems to have nailed the consumer mirrorless ILC with the EOS M.  So it should be no surprise that Canon got into mirrorless on a higher level with the EOS R, but then again, it should be. Canon is slower to react to competition than just about anyone. Why this, why now? Canon feels the competition.  For most of history since maybe the 1940s or 1950s, Canon and Nikon had much of the professional market for cameras. In the 1960s, led by Nikon, they won an 80% share, and it's been pretty much 80\\u201390% ever since. Canon managed to flip the market share on Nikon by being the first to court consumers, and then by delivering the fastest speeds for pro sports shooters. But for a long time, the only 35mm, then full-frame choice for most pros was Nikon or Canon.  This last year, the whole industry sold only 11.6 million ILCs, less than half of those sold in 2013. And 2017 was actually an 8% increase from 2016. But more the point, DSLRs sold only accounted for 65% of the ILC market\\u2026 clearly, Nikon and Canon were no longer winning an 80\\u201390% share. And while Canon's mirrorless sales were up 70% in 2017, Nikon wasn't even part of that. And of course, neither was competitive with Sony, Olympus, Panasonic, or Fujifilm in higher-end mirrorless. No one knows just where the DSLR vs. mirrorless ratio settles out in the long term, but it's not going to be terribly favorable to any company only making DSLRs.  What's It For?  If you look carefully at the EOS R, like the Nikon Z's, you'll know just what it's for: the EOS R is a mirrorless body for Canon users to buy, so that they don't buy Sonys. This is the big factor. Canon users have been trying Sony A7s with adapters, and liking them. Some keep it as an accessory, but some sell their Canon gear and move to Sony. Canon needs that to stop, and their first reaction to this situation is the EOS R.  Canon's introducing one body and four lenses, two of them quite expensive, but still, that's not a full system for nearly anyone who needs a system camera. It's a start. But if you're already a Canon shooter, the R is with an adapter is going to let you try out mirrorless with all of your glass \\u2014 even EF-S lenses, but EF-M lenses are impossible \\u2014 your existing batteries and flash units, etc. It's a much simpler way to experiment with mirrorless for today's Canon shooter. If you're new to ILCs and want full-frame mirrorless, EOS R won't be a great option for at least 3\\u20135 years, depending on how quickly Canon rolls out new glass.  So you're supposed to compare the EOS R to a Sony A7 Mark III, but the closest match is actually the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV. So you're getting more or less a mirrorless 5D Mark IV with some improvements/extra features for $900 less. That's a pretty fine deal, speaking from the Canon universe. It's a bit more expensive than the A7 Mark III, but no one's more aggressive on body pricing than Sony.  I think it succeeds in its mission. If I still had my Canon system and was ready for full frame mirrorless, the EOS R is a no-brainer versus the Sony. It's not even the cost of the bodies or the minute details of the features, but the fact it's already part of my system. The cheap lens adapter is only $100, and it works perfectly. For a bit more, I could get the adapter with filter holder, simply brilliant for video work.  Video Issues  Alas, on that latter one, Canon's still being Canon, and not in a good way. They're still crippling 4K video on the EOS R, delivering the same 1.7x crop you have on the EOS 5D mark IV. If you're buying a full-frame DSLR for video, the point is to have full frame video. With that crop, you're better off going to a Panasonic GH5 or a Blackmagic Design Pocket Cinema Camera 4K, depending on your needs.  I expect for most stills work, you have a 5D Mark IV as far as the quality goes. You won't quite match Sony in very low light, but you'll have a bit more resolution in bright light, so it's probably not a big deal for most photographers. You'll have the Canon color, which Sony has yet to match, and the Canon menus you're used to\\u2026 well, maybe. They have a few new controls on the camera, which changes around the way its used. There's a programmable ring control on lenses, but you won't run into that with adapted EF lenses unless you get the third adapter, the one with the ring control. There's also a touch strip on the back, which most reviewers aren't yet crazy about.  Neither Sony nor Canon has 10-bit in-camera video, which is what you need for serious Log shooting. But the EOS R does have that as an external option, at least. I'd bet on Sony's A7S Mark III offering 10-bit in some fashion, but like Canon, Sony's got their own cinema camera business they feel compelled to protect by crippling the mirrorless models. Oddly, though, Nikon opted for the same thing, in-camera 8-bit, external 10-bit, even without a video market to protect. I guess that leaves them both with a feature to add to a higher end model, next year. Or save money and buy the GH5 right now.  Conclusions  So basically, I think the EOS R is attractive to anyone with a full Canon system thinking about mirrorless. If Canon's annoying behaviors haven't driven you away yet, this may well be your mirrorless. I don't really find any huge problems with it. Knowing that Sony was the initial target, nothing about the EOS R or the Nikon Zs were particularly unexpected. Both aim for the Sony's, Nikon at both the A7III and the A7RIII, Canon's basically doing the A7III competitor now. I would hope they're holding off an A7RIII competitor until they have some improved sensor tech, probably also going into the EOS 5DS Mark II."}, {"upvote": 8, "content": "One of these photos was taken with a brand new 5D mark IV.

If I wanted a 4K camera for video, I'd recommend either get a Panasonic GH4 or perhaps a Sony A7s mark II.  The Nikon D80 (2006) and the D3 (2007) are ancient models and don't shoot video. The D3s does shoot video, but only 720p, not full HD.  The EOS 7D (2009) is also fairly old. It can shoot 720p or 1080p video, but only 12 minutes at a time.

The Nikon D5300 isn't a bad choice for video. It's a few models old, it came out in 2003, the current model is the D5600, so it's may be available for a value price. But this line is a consumer line, APS-C sensor, and not terribly expensive. It can shoot video at 1080p up to 60fps\\u2026 not something you'd need for vlogging, but you want 60p for sports or other action video. Another advantage for vlogging, the D5300 has built-in WiFi, so it can be controlled wirelessly via an app. Most Canon and Nikon can be tethered via USB for remote control, and some have add-on controls, but it's handy to have it built-in.  I have the EOS 6D, and it produces amazing video, particularly in low light, where it blows away my far more expensive dedicated camcorders. The 6D right now is a good bargain, but mostly because everyone expects Canon to announce the 6D mark II Real Soon Now. The 6D also has built-in WiFi.  The EOS 5D mark III is the upgrade of Canon's breakthrough EOS 5D mark II. It's a great camera, one of the go-to standards for video-on-stills camera shooting. But while it's a solid choice if you can afford it, it's not the best choice. For one, it's been superceeded by the EOS 5D mark IV, if you're looking for a higher end model that shoots great video.  Of those on your list, the Canon EOS 80D would be my choice for anyone wanting a strong video option. Like the Nikon, it can shoot a variety of modes up to 1080p60. But the real advantage is in the sensor. This is Canon's second-generation mid-range DSLR with what they call a Dual Pixel sensor. This sensor splits each pixel into two separate photodiodes. Based on the way they're masked, each sensor pair works like a phase-detect autofocus sensor. So unlike every other DSLR on your list, the 80D can give you full performance autofocus in video, and things you usually just find on camcorders and mirrorless cameras, like follow-focus in video, etc. Dual Pixel is also used on Canon's 5D mark IV and all the new Cinema EOS video cameras. And the 80D also has built-in WiFi.  Far as the larger idea of a full camera system goes, you can't really go wrong with either Canon or Nikon. They have the two most complete lines of cameras and two most complete collection of lenses. However, neither offers a mirrorless option. So that means you're only shooting video from the back screen, not the viewfinder. And that only the 80D on your list has fully function video autofocus\\u2026 the others will AF in video, but it's on demand, not continuous, and it's often not very good. The phase detect sensors that DSLRs use are not available with the mirror up, which is what you have in video mode.  For one-person vlogging, keep in mind you are going to want to see yourself, which means either an add-on monitor while shooting or an articulated screen. The 80D and the D5300 both have fully articulated screens which let you see what you're recording from the front of the camera. The others do not, and will absolutely require an external monitor for vlogging."}, {"upvote": 4, "content": "It is undoubtedly an exciting product because of what Canon has claimed. Two most exciting things are:  Pro's:  1. IBIS. 2. 8K video Full Frame! (Exciting)! 3. Canon colour science is brilliant. Now, I will tell you why it may just not be the right camera just yet!  Con's & Not so Con's:  1. Canon, even though one of the oldest player took a lot of time to implement mirrorless and IBIS. 2. Sony on the other hand came in like a storm with their Alpha series when Canon 5D series was ruling the market. 3. What canon did over a decade, Sony was able to pull out magic in just couple of years. 4. Canon has never considered a good 4K slow-mo on their cameras & crop on the sensor when you bump frame rates is such a turnoff. On the other hand Sony has brilliant slow-mo. 5. Also Canon has come up with their new lens range for R Series camera. It will set you back a lot of money as the red rings are amazing but expensive. 6. Canon cameras perform extremely well with Canon glass. But Sony overall does a decent job with third party lens. Undoubtably Canon wins this one. L series lens with Canon body is any day better than Sony glass on Sony body. (Sony is slowly catching up there for sure). 7. DYNAMIC RANGE & LOW LIGHT - I cannot stress enough on these 2 factors. Canon is definitely amazing in these 2 categories. Sony is notches ahead of Canon. A7S2 can literally see in pitch dark situations. (Sorry Canon, but - Sony) Overall Verdict:  I am still a canon shooter and will forever love what Canon did in the initial days. But now the competition is cutthroat and Canon needs to pace up. EOS R5 is one such attempt. But, with Blackmagic providing 6K RAW (with editing solutions out of the box) for 2500$ and all the camera enthusiasts awaiting Sony's A7S3 launch. It might just not be the right time yet to invest in Canon EOS R5. If I were you I would wait for Sony's launch (which I am sure is coming sooner than later) and later decide upon the pick. If Sony disappoints, I would strongly vouch for Blackmagic PCC6K as for the price tag, it is just way too delicious.  P.S: I am still a canon shooter (Canon 5DM4). I am not promoting or degrading any product/company here. I am definitely not paid by any of them (Even though I wish I was).

And 600D might be still worth serving many purpose given it is supported by Magic Lantern and can do 1080p.  1100D can only do 720p and it is bit outdated because of that.  So, if budget is tight, and need it for school, go ahead and get 600D, for other purpose, might want to add bit more budget and look for more recent Canon model."}, {"upvote": 40, "content": "The Nomenclature of Canon EOS cameras goes like this.

Two Digit Model No: Example: 60D, 70D Crop Sensor, Advanced DSLRs, these will have most of the features of the fully professional DSLRs. The biggest difference would be the sensor size and hence crop factor. The cameras are great, have large number of cross type focal points. Good battery as well, a bit heavy.

Cameras come in at several price points -  entry-level, upper-entry, mid-tier and high-end models, etc. Also within those model lines just like how the same model car have different option/feature packages (Honda Civic LX, DX, EX) which come with ABS brakes, upgraded sound system, sunroof, etc... cameras model also have different packages.  So think of the T3i as a 2011 Honda Fit with the premium option package (i.e. a higher resolution, tiltable LCD) and the T5 as the 2014 Honda Fit with standard options package, but since it is newer it has a better \\\"engine\\\" (in this case a newer sensor and imaging processing chip).  While a tiltable LCD is convenient, personally I would prefer the better image quality (from my search online the T5 is less than$100 USD more than the T3i ($450 vs $360).  While Canon and Nikon have the largest lens selection overall, I don't think that is really important for someone starting out. I don't believe in \\\"buying into a system.\\\" I think you should buy whatever works for you right now and start taking photos and then as your skills/preferences improve... you can re-adjust your gear collection as needed. Don't be afraid to dump all your gear if another system clearly works better for the type of photography that you want to do.  Personally, despite having always purchased SLRs for the last decade... I personally would suggest considering a mirrorless to someone new to photography. They are smaller and lighter, so you are more likely to always have it with you to take photos. One drawback is that the entry-level model don't have a separate viewfinder (the Sony a6000 does).  What camera is a good fit depends on what you are doing to be using the camera for in the next 3 months. People always have this ambition aspirations to become a professional photographer... to get into portrait, landscape, macro, wildlife, sport photography (i.e. everything) but contrary to common belief, I think short-term focus is more important than sky high ambition.

While the focus system in the t5i isn't up to extreme situations like the 7d II or the 1Dx it will outperform the t3i for focus speed on stationary subjects and has increased capabilities for tracking moving subjects.  There are other cosmetic/ergonomic changes to the T5i including menu system upgrades, button upgrades, and textured skin in the camera body.  You will need to handle both cameras to determine if these are important to you.  Given the above, you need to match your needs to the camera capabilities.

Here my personal advice is to buy the Same brand you started with as you are familiar with that brand."}, {"upvote": 78, "content": "I see a lot of answers claiming \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" for photography in general. Do not get this line of thinking stuck in your head because it's not entirely true. In fact, to be honest, this statement is used many times by people who simply can't afford good gear and are jealous at those who can. If you can't afford good gear right now, that's fine; work with what you can afford and save up money to grow into better gear over time. The best camera is always the one you have with you and by this I mean, if you own a $6,500 Canon 1DX and it's sitting at home, your best camera may be the free one that came built into the phone in your pocket!  While it is true, skill is the most important aspect of almost anything, including photography, your gear and even more specifically, your lenses, are just as important. A good lens on an inexpensive camera is always better than a cheap lens on an expensive camera. If you're just starting out and looking for a camera for a beginner, try to think about what sort of photography you'll be doing. General photography such as family photos, photos of your friends, pets, etc.; landscape photography; wildlife photography; street photography, etc. If you don't know yet, that's okay but if you have a goal of developing skills specific to one of these styles, it will help with camera selection.  When getting started, I'd get something inexpensive but not so cheap that your photo quality ends up discouraging you altogether (again, this is where the \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" nonsense kicks in.) I'll cover a couple types and why they're good starter cameras. And with any camera you choose, always try to keep the camera out of \\\"automatic mode\\\" if possible so you begin to master the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  Point-and-Shoot or Camera Phone  These cameras are very inexpensive and with the newer smartphones, the camera is built right in and often takes better photos than the DSLR's from just a few years ago! This is the most inexpensive route to take (and may not cost a penny if you use the camera on your phone) and it helps you learn about composition, lighting, etc. If you're already past this point and want a camera you can grow into, the following are good options:  Traditional SLR's  I know, this is probably not what most people think of when deciding on a beginner's camera but I want to mention it because if you have one of these lying around in your house (parent's or grandparent's old camera, etc.), they're great for learning the basics of a camera with all of the digital stuff removed. SLR (single lens reflex) cameras aren't used much anymore because of the cost of operation, decreased photo quality, and lack of film processing labs, however, I think any aspiring photographer should own or at least use one because they are the \\\"original camera\\\", they are inexpensive, and they help give you a greater appreciation for the luxury of digital photography (not limited to 24-36 photos per roll, immediate results where you can see your photo seconds after taking it, easy and fast multiple frame shooting, and no cost by ruining a roll of film or wasting it on bad photos.) If you buy a traditional SLR 35mm camera, I'd go for something like the Nikon 35mm F2AS with a 50mm \\\"prime lens\\\", or similar. Here's a photo of one of mine:  Digital SLR's  Digital SLR's, or DSLR's, have been the most popular choice for many years now, they're easy to find used, and they're a good starting point in learning photography. These cameras are basically digital versions of the original SLR camera but offer much more flexibility and many more options. Whagt we're seeing right now, however, is a switch from DSLR's to \\\"mirrorless cameras\\\", including the very popular \\\"Micro Four Thirds\\\" cameras which use a smaller sensor, yet often outperform the DSLR's. I'll touch on those, below. Anyway, an inexpensive or used DSLR is a good choice for starting out and I'd recommend an entry level Canon DSLR such as one of the \\\"Rebel\\\" series cameras. I currently use a Canon 1DX which is NOT a beginner's camera, and my old Canon 5D Mark II (this is a great beginner's camera, easy to find, and inexpensive.) Here's a photo of the Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm prime lens attached:  Mirrorless Cameras  These cameras really are \\\"the future of photography\\\" although many professional photographers would scoff at you for even suggesting such a thing because just as it was when SLR's were phasing out, DSLR using pro's often get stuck in their ways and refuse to move with the times. Even today there are professional photographers who refuse to switch from SLR to DSLR! Mirrorless cameras are superior to DSLR's in almost every way: They have higher resolution (megapixels) for a fraction of the cost of DSLR's; there's no mirror flapping around making noise and causing camera vibration; they're smaller and easier to carry, many can shoot 4K and even Cinema 4K video (while Canon and Nikon refuse to adapt and offer this feature for a reasonable price in their DSLR's); and overall, they're less expensive. If you can afford one (they're often cheaper than many new DSLR's), go for it! I currently shoot with a Panasonic Lumix GH4 because I shoot photography AND I need to shoot 4K video and this camera does both. An even less expensive alternative is the Lumix GH3 which sells for around $500, a quarter of the price of the GH4. Here's a photo of the Lumix GH4, a \\\"mirrorless camera\\\":  Regardless of what you choose, unless it's a cheap $30 point-and-shoot or your phone's camera, try to make a decision on which camera format you want to grow into, otherwise you'll be wasting money on a camera and the expensive lenses that you'll end up not using when you switch to a different format.  Taking an introductory photography class or workshop is also a good idea when getting started as you'll more quickly learn the basics including aperture, exposure, shutter speed, composition, and editing.

So, if Minato tries to use a rasengan and Sakura has her seal active, then he achieves nothing.

Like how Naruto defeat pain, or Granny Chio uses her knowledge about Sasori with Sakura to defeat him. The way adult Sakura got hurt by Shin, if teen Sakura was touched by Sasori's Kunai, team 7 would be a gay team by now.

Another thing, Luffy and Zoro were closely equal in Whiskeypeak, and Zoro%3C%3C%3C%3CEnel, but Luffy defeat Enel due to his Rubber ability. But Luffy would die if its Kuzan/Kizaru.

Human emotion and will power can not be measured by equation. Unexpected event driven by indivuduals is the soul of anime. Dont destroy it.

But, if you're using AI Servo to focus on action, likely the focus improvements will be minor."}, {"upvote": 3, "content": "Depends on just what you're looking for.   I'm a 6D user, haven't had as much experience with the 5D Mk II. Certainly the 6D has an improved sensor technology (lower noise), slightly lower resolution, less of a multi-shot buffer, it's not a clear winner for everything.   I would guess video performance is similar at the sensor (other than a slight edge on 6D sensitivity), but it's got better image processing. It can record AVC in IPB frames, rather than just IP frames on the 5D, and it can record in I-Frame-only mode. And up to 29'59\\\" of video (that stupid European limit -- stupid, anyway, to force it on those of us not living in affected countries). But the 5D mk III is better still for video, as it includes an anti-aliasing filter in addition to all that.   Some people complained about the 6D's polycarbonate top... necessary for GPS and WiFi antennas. Some prefer the CF card in the 5D series to the SD card in the 6D. I was always well invested in SD cards, from cameras and camcorders, so I consider that a bonus.   As for focus, the 6D only has a single, central cross-point type AF sensor... kind of an odd decision, given that my cheaper 60D has 9 cross point type. However, that central sensor is very fast and accurate, and I'm kind of in the habit of centralizing my focal point and locking it... assuming I use AF. It's certainly nothing like the crazy 5D Mk III AF with all those points."}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "I have both. I use them for different things. Neither of them general photography. I like them both and the quality is very good. The 6D is a little newer so things have been upgraded but if you look at 2 shots you would not know what camera was used.

I'm not sure if the sensors are different, but they are the same size. The 6D started selling in the 4th quarter of 2012, less than a year after the 5D Mk II stopped being manufactured. The 6D has one critical difference, the Digic 5 processor. This replaced the Digic 4 used on the 5D Mk II. The differences in processors are speed, but more importantly the ability to deal with dark shadows with little noise. You should have cleaner blacks with the 6D. Aside from that, the cameras are very similar. I'd expect the video to be just a little better with the 6D also, due to the newer and better processor. Current Canon DSLRs use either the Digic 6 or 7 processor.

Not only is the 1D X around $6,000 (body-only), but you're going to need expensive CFast cards for 4K video, and the 4K video on the thing is in gigantic Motion JPEG files, and not all that amazing anyway. If I wanted a 4K camera for video, I'd recommend either get a Panasonic GH4 or perhaps a Sony A7s mark II.  The Nikon D80 (2006) and the D3 (2007) are ancient models and don't shoot video. The D3s does shoot video, but only 720p, not full HD.  The EOS 7D (2009) is also fairly old. It can shoot 720p or 1080p video, but only 12 minutes at a time. The others here can shoot 29\\u203259\\u2033 without stopping \\u2014 that's a limit set to avoid paying a European camcorder tax. While it doesn't apply at all in the USA, most camera manufacturers (other than Panasonic, far as I know) impose this limit even on North American and Japanese models.  The Nikon D5300 isn't a bad choice for video. It's a few models old, it came out in 2003, the current model is the D5600, so it's may be available for a value price. But this line is a consumer line, APS-C sensor, and not terribly expensive. It can shoot video at 1080p up to 60fps\\u2026 not something you'd need for vlogging, but you want 60p for sports or other action video. Another advantage for vlogging, the D5300 has built-in WiFi, so it can be controlled wirelessly via an app. Most Canon and Nikon can be tethered via USB for remote control, and some have add-on controls, but it's handy to have it built-in.  I have the EOS 6D, and it produces amazing video, particularly in low light, where it blows away my far more expensive dedicated camcorders. The 6D right now is a good bargain, but mostly because everyone expects Canon to announce the 6D mark II Real Soon Now. The 6D also has built-in WiFi.  The EOS 5D mark III is the upgrade of Canon's breakthrough EOS 5D mark II. It's a great camera, one of the go-to standards for video-on-stills camera shooting. But while it's a solid choice if you can afford it, it's not the best choice. For one, it's been superceeded by the EOS 5D mark IV, if you're looking for a higher end model that shoots great video.  Of those on your list, the Canon EOS 80D would be my choice for anyone wanting a strong video option. Like the Nikon, it can shoot a variety of modes up to 1080p60. But the real advantage is in the sensor. This is Canon's second-generation mid-range DSLR with what they call a Dual Pixel sensor. This sensor splits each pixel into two separate photodiodes. Based on the way they're masked, each sensor pair works like a phase-detect autofocus sensor. So unlike every other DSLR on your list, the 80D can give you full performance autofocus in video, and things you usually just find on camcorders and mirrorless cameras, like follow-focus in video, etc. Dual Pixel is also used on Canon's 5D mark IV and all the new Cinema EOS video cameras. And the 80D also has built-in WiFi.  Far as the larger idea of a full camera system goes, you can't really go wrong with either Canon or Nikon. They have the two most complete lines of cameras and two most complete collection of lenses. However, neither offers a mirrorless option. So that means you're only shooting video from the back screen, not the viewfinder. And that only the 80D on your list has fully function video autofocus\\u2026 the others will AF in video, but it's on demand, not continuous, and it's often not very good. The phase detect sensors that DSLRs use are not available with the mirror up, which is what you have in video mode.  For one-person vlogging, keep in mind you are going to want to see yourself, which means either an add-on monitor while shooting or an articulated screen. The 80D and the D5300 both have fully articulated screens which let you see what you're recording from the front of the camera. The others do not, and will absolutely require an external monitor for vlogging."}, {"upvote": 9, "content": "From the very first version."}, {"upvote": 7, "content": "Take photos with all three cameras using similar lenses.

In the days of film, when I was still new to photography, I photographed my niece's engagement using two different cameras, an expensive Nikon FM 2, and an old cheaper Mamiya. Both Cameras had 50 mm lens. Each camera had a roll of 36 films which I sent for developing.  The prints were developed and placed in an album. When looking at the photos I could not tell which photos were taken with which camera.  Yet I had spent quite a bit of money upgrading to a Nikon FM 2, believing that I was buying a superior camera which would give me far better quality photos.  Coming back to your question. All three cameras you mention, are excellent cameras. I would be comfortable and happy using any one of them.

Worry less about the best camera and hone your skill instead.  Owning the best camera does not make you a good photographer.

At this point it's far enough behind the curve that shooting with it is more difficult than it needs to be:   * The performance of the camera is simply slow in operation  * The display is small and of poor quality  * Many of the 5Ds floating around have seen a LOT of use. They're at the end of their lifespans You don't need to move to full frame. It's not necessary to get a full frame camera for very many reasons.  The difference isn't night and day from a crop sensor camera in the vast majority of situations, unless you're using VERY high ISOs or printing VERY large prints.  I have a 7D, 6D, and an Olympus Pen camera. The 7D was maligned for not having great image quality for a long time - but for most subjects, you won't be able to tell the difference unless you're zoomed in at 100%.  The little Olympus, which has a sensor 1/4 the size of my 6D, can produce results that are very nearly on par with it in optimal situations, for real world use!  Yes, if you look at sample comparison pictures from these cameras, you'll see a very significant difference. But for most images that end up being used in the real world, the differences aren't highlighted - they're obfuscated between them. I might look at the whole picture on my 4 megapixel 30\\\" monitor - a real resolution my Olympus can easily exceed with ease, never mind the 7D or the 6D. I might print an 8x12\\\" image, which uses ~8 megapixels. Beyond that, the Olympus images will start to break down a TINY bit, but they still look great at 11x14 and larger.  I can do some things with the 6D that I can't with the 7D - the high ISO performance is VERY notably superior - I can comfortably shoot ISO 12000 and make nice looking results for web sized images or medium sized prints (8x12). The 7D degrades significantly in quality after ISO 3200. The 6D doesn't look pretty at 100% at 12k, but that doesn't matter very much, because at 100% on my big computer monitor, it is like looking at an image that is printed to approximately 54\\\" x 36\\\".  Even if I crop half of the image away, I'm not losing much.  Don't get me wrong. The images are cleaner and more detailed. It's obvious when looking at the files.

It was only the fourth full frame camera on the market (the others were from Contax, Canon, and Kodak, respectively), and by far the lowest cost.  The other one from Canon, the EOS 1Ds, listed for $7,999.00.   So this was a camera that, to a pro, seemed like a great deal. But still too expensive for most consumers. Which means, while you may have a few of these being sold by old rich guys who never used them, it's also quite possible that an old Canon 5D was used by a pro.  Not every pro is dropping their cameras down a flight or two of stairs (when I was in High School, I actually saw a visiting pro drop his Canon A1 down a flight of stairs... the lens hood was bent, but he picked it up and, far as I know, it kept on working). But even a nice looking used Canon 5D might have some serious mileage on it.   And this didn't quite have a pro-rated shutter... it's rate for 100,000 shots, versus 150,000 in today's 5DIII or 400,000 shots in the EOS 1D X. So you really want to get a shutter cycle count if you were to buy this camera. A new shutter -- if you can still get one for a 5D -- might run another $300. Unlike more professional tape-based video cameras, this isn't something you can just pop up in the menu, far as I can tell. But if you had access to the camera, you could get that from the EXIF data in a shot. So that means, the reseller can, too. Maybe nothing you can get out of Amazon's resellers, but maybe someone on eBay.  Anyway, I'd look elsewhere for a new camera. The EOS 6D (one of my cameras) was on sale a week ago for under $1,000... not bad for a current model full frame. Though it's also expected to be Mark-IIed sometime this year. So if you're not too particular, that may be the time to buy. If not, as Edward Calvey [ https://www.quora.com/profile/Edward-Calvey-1 ] pointed out, the Nikon D3300 can be had for around the same price, and outperforms the 5D on just about every point.

There is a reason why there are over fifty lenses made for that camera. If only one lens worked for everything and everyone, that's all they would sell.   The most commonly used lens with a camera like that is Canon's 18-55mm EF-S lens. The latest version of this lens is the 18-55mm STM lens, which is sharper.  This is a lightweight, sharp zoom lens that covers wide angle to moderate telephoto. It is a lens you'll use a great deal of the time.  Another excellent \\\"walkabout\\\" lens to consider instead is the 18-135mm STM lens. Slightly heavier and more expensive, but it has over 4x zoom magnification at 135mm. So the 18-55 or 18-135 covers typical use. That's what you should buy first.  Later, as you take more photos, there are other lenses to consider buying, depending on the kinds of photos you want to take. For example:  55-250mm or 70-200mm, or even 100-400mm telephoto: These lenses are most commonly used for sports and wildlife photography, and also in wedding photography (close-ups from a long distance). Canon's 55-250mm is lightweight and inexpensive, while the 70-200 and 100-400 are L lenses which can cost over $1,000.  For landscapes, architecture and interior shots, an ultra-wideangle lens is great. Canon has a new lens, the 10-18mm, which is about $300 and should be excellent for this.   But if you want to shoot indoors, for a play or concert, and perhaps you can't use flash, then you want a lens that can allow a lot of light. For this, you would look at a \\\"fast\\\" lens such as Canon's 50mm f/1.8 or 50mm f/1.4.  The other advantage of these very fast lenses is that their high aperture have very little depth of field, and so they are very popular for portraits, because they let you create a blurry, dreamy-looking background. In addition to the 50mm, Canon makes an 80 or 85mm (I forget which) which is very fast and popular for portraits.  There are many more, such as tilt/shift, ultra-wide, ultra-telephoto, but I've covered a really broad spectrum and probably more than you need for getting started. However, the one type of lens you should really avoid is the so-called \\\"super zoom,\\\" which is  any lens which covers ultra-wide to ultra-telephoto, such as an 18-200mm or 18-300mm. Lenses with this much range are invariably blurry; at least, they don't have the tack sharpness of the lenses I've mentioned. They're also quite heavy. Since 90% of your walkabout shooting can be covered with an 18-55 or 18-135, carrying the added weight of a super zoom around your neck is uncomfortable, and the results sub-par."}, {"upvote": 2, "content": "This zoom, the Zeiss 21\\u2013100 with an EF mount will be better than most:  The price might freak you out.

Do not get this line of thinking stuck in your head because it's not entirely true. In fact, to be honest, this statement is used many times by people who simply can't afford good gear and are jealous at those who can. If you can't afford good gear right now, that's fine; work with what you can afford and save up money to grow into better gear over time. The best camera is always the one you have with you and by this I mean, if you own a $6,500 Canon 1DX and it's sitting at home, your best camera may be the free one that came built into the phone in your pocket!  While it is true, skill is the most important aspect of almost anything, including photography, your gear and even more specifically, your lenses, are just as important. A good lens on an inexpensive camera is always better than a cheap lens on an expensive camera. If you're just starting out and looking for a camera for a beginner, try to think about what sort of photography you'll be doing. General photography such as family photos, photos of your friends, pets, etc.; landscape photography; wildlife photography; street photography, etc. If you don't know yet, that's okay but if you have a goal of developing skills specific to one of these styles, it will help with camera selection.  When getting started, I'd get something inexpensive but not so cheap that your photo quality ends up discouraging you altogether (again, this is where the \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" nonsense kicks in.) I'll cover a couple types and why they're good starter cameras. And with any camera you choose, always try to keep the camera out of \\\"automatic mode\\\" if possible so you begin to master the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  Point-and-Shoot or Camera Phone  These cameras are very inexpensive and with the newer smartphones, the camera is built right in and often takes better photos than the DSLR's from just a few years ago! This is the most inexpensive route to take (and may not cost a penny if you use the camera on your phone) and it helps you learn about composition, lighting, etc. If you're already past this point and want a camera you can grow into, the following are good options:  Traditional SLR's  I know, this is probably not what most people think of when deciding on a beginner's camera but I want to mention it because if you have one of these lying around in your house (parent's or grandparent's old camera, etc.), they're great for learning the basics of a camera with all of the digital stuff removed. SLR (single lens reflex) cameras aren't used much anymore because of the cost of operation, decreased photo quality, and lack of film processing labs, however, I think any aspiring photographer should own or at least use one because they are the \\\"original camera\\\", they are inexpensive, and they help give you a greater appreciation for the luxury of digital photography (not limited to 24-36 photos per roll, immediate results where you can see your photo seconds after taking it, easy and fast multiple frame shooting, and no cost by ruining a roll of film or wasting it on bad photos.) If you buy a traditional SLR 35mm camera, I'd go for something like the Nikon 35mm F2AS with a 50mm \\\"prime lens\\\", or similar. Here's a photo of one of mine:  Digital SLR's  Digital SLR's, or DSLR's, have been the most popular choice for many years now, they're easy to find used, and they're a good starting point in learning photography. These cameras are basically digital versions of the original SLR camera but offer much more flexibility and many more options. Whagt we're seeing right now, however, is a switch from DSLR's to \\\"mirrorless cameras\\\", including the very popular \\\"Micro Four Thirds\\\" cameras which use a smaller sensor, yet often outperform the DSLR's. I'll touch on those, below. Anyway, an inexpensive or used DSLR is a good choice for starting out and I'd recommend an entry level Canon DSLR such as one of the \\\"Rebel\\\" series cameras. I currently use a Canon 1DX which is NOT a beginner's camera, and my old Canon 5D Mark II (this is a great beginner's camera, easy to find, and inexpensive.) Here's a photo of the Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm prime lens attached:  Mirrorless Cameras  These cameras really are \\\"the future of photography\\\" although many professional photographers would scoff at you for even suggesting such a thing because just as it was when SLR's were phasing out, DSLR using pro's often get stuck in their ways and refuse to move with the times. Even today there are professional photographers who refuse to switch from SLR to DSLR! Mirrorless cameras are superior to DSLR's in almost every way: They have higher resolution (megapixels) for a fraction of the cost of DSLR's; there's no mirror flapping around making noise and causing camera vibration; they're smaller and easier to carry, many can shoot 4K and even Cinema 4K video (while Canon and Nikon refuse to adapt and offer this feature for a reasonable price in their DSLR's); and overall, they're less expensive. If you can afford one (they're often cheaper than many new DSLR's), go for it! I currently shoot with a Panasonic Lumix GH4 because I shoot photography AND I need to shoot 4K video and this camera does both. An even less expensive alternative is the Lumix GH3 which sells for around $500, a quarter of the price of the GH4. Here's a photo of the Lumix GH4, a \\\"mirrorless camera\\\":  Regardless of what you choose, unless it's a cheap $30 point-and-shoot or your phone's camera, try to make a decision on which camera format you want to grow into, otherwise you'll be wasting money on a camera and the expensive lenses that you'll end up not using when you switch to a different format.  Taking an introductory photography class or workshop is also a good idea when getting started as you'll more quickly learn the basics including aperture, exposure, shutter speed, composition, and editing.

And I think they made some good decisions, and a few bad ones that may have not been choices as much as technical limitations.  Neither Canon nor Nikon were actually new to mirrorless with last August's introductions. But the R and the Z are professional formats, even if the first models are not a match for the top-of-the-line DSLRs yet. Both Canon and Nikon took on the idea that mirrorless was something less than DSLR, a step between DSLR and compact digital cameras (aka point and shoot). Nikon's 1 system used the same 1\\u2033 sensor size found in high-end P&S cameras like the Sony RX10 and RX100. But Canon put out a very compact APS-C system with their EOS M. And a funny thing happened: while Nikon's 1 system is now defunct, the EOS M is very popular, albeit not necessarily in the USA. Canon's been the #2 mirrorless brand in Japan in 2016 and 2017 (BCN rankings, second to Olympus) and looks to be taking the #1 spot for the 2018 year\\u2026 without even counting the EOS R. Canon seems to have nailed the consumer mirrorless ILC with the EOS M.  So it should be no surprise that Canon got into mirrorless on a higher level with the EOS R, but then again, it should be. Canon is slower to react to competition than just about anyone. Why this, why now? Canon feels the competition.  For most of history since maybe the 1940s or 1950s, Canon and Nikon had much of the professional market for cameras. In the 1960s, led by Nikon, they won an 80% share, and it's been pretty much 80\\u201390% ever since. Canon managed to flip the market share on Nikon by being the first to court consumers, and then by delivering the fastest speeds for pro sports shooters. But for a long time, the only 35mm, then full-frame choice for most pros was Nikon or Canon.  This last year, the whole industry sold only 11.6 million ILCs, less than half of those sold in 2013. And 2017 was actually an 8% increase from 2016. But more the point, DSLRs sold only accounted for 65% of the ILC market\\u2026 clearly, Nikon and Canon were no longer winning an 80\\u201390% share. And while Canon's mirrorless sales were up 70% in 2017, Nikon wasn't even part of that. And of course, neither was competitive with Sony, Olympus, Panasonic, or Fujifilm in higher-end mirrorless. No one knows just where the DSLR vs. mirrorless ratio settles out in the long term, but it's not going to be terribly favorable to any company only making DSLRs.  What's It For?  If you look carefully at the EOS R, like the Nikon Z's, you'll know just what it's for: the EOS R is a mirrorless body for Canon users to buy, so that they don't buy Sonys. This is the big factor. Canon users have been trying Sony A7s with adapters, and liking them. Some keep it as an accessory, but some sell their Canon gear and move to Sony. Canon needs that to stop, and their first reaction to this situation is the EOS R.  Canon's introducing one body and four lenses, two of them quite expensive, but still, that's not a full system for nearly anyone who needs a system camera. It's a start. But if you're already a Canon shooter, the R is with an adapter is going to let you try out mirrorless with all of your glass \\u2014 even EF-S lenses, but EF-M lenses are impossible \\u2014 your existing batteries and flash units, etc. It's a much simpler way to experiment with mirrorless for today's Canon shooter. If you're new to ILCs and want full-frame mirrorless, EOS R won't be a great option for at least 3\\u20135 years, depending on how quickly Canon rolls out new glass.  So you're supposed to compare the EOS R to a Sony A7 Mark III, but the closest match is actually the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV. So you're getting more or less a mirrorless 5D Mark IV with some improvements/extra features for $900 less. That's a pretty fine deal, speaking from the Canon universe. It's a bit more expensive than the A7 Mark III, but no one's more aggressive on body pricing than Sony.  I think it succeeds in its mission. If I still had my Canon system and was ready for full frame mirrorless, the EOS R is a no-brainer versus the Sony. It's not even the cost of the bodies or the minute details of the features, but the fact it's already part of my system. The cheap lens adapter is only $100, and it works perfectly. For a bit more, I could get the adapter with filter holder, simply brilliant for video work.  Video Issues  Alas, on that latter one, Canon's still being Canon, and not in a good way. They're still crippling 4K video on the EOS R, delivering the same 1.7x crop you have on the EOS 5D mark IV. If you're buying a full-frame DSLR for video, the point is to have full frame video. With that crop, you're better off going to a Panasonic GH5 or a Blackmagic Design Pocket Cinema Camera 4K, depending on your needs.  I expect for most stills work, you have a 5D Mark IV as far as the quality goes. You won't quite match Sony in very low light, but you'll have a bit more resolution in bright light, so it's probably not a big deal for most photographers. You'll have the Canon color, which Sony has yet to match, and the Canon menus you're used to\\u2026 well, maybe. They have a few new controls on the camera, which changes around the way its used. There's a programmable ring control on lenses, but you won't run into that with adapted EF lenses unless you get the third adapter, the one with the ring control. There's also a touch strip on the back, which most reviewers aren't yet crazy about.  Neither Sony nor Canon has 10-bit in-camera video, which is what you need for serious Log shooting. But the EOS R does have that as an external option, at least. I'd bet on Sony's A7S Mark III offering 10-bit in some fashion, but like Canon, Sony's got their own cinema camera business they feel compelled to protect by crippling the mirrorless models. Oddly, though, Nikon opted for the same thing, in-camera 8-bit, external 10-bit, even without a video market to protect. I guess that leaves them both with a feature to add to a higher end model, next year. Or save money and buy the GH5 right now.  Conclusions  So basically, I think the EOS R is attractive to anyone with a full Canon system thinking about mirrorless. If Canon's annoying behaviors haven't driven you away yet, this may well be your mirrorless. I don't really find any huge problems with it. Knowing that Sony was the initial target, nothing about the EOS R or the Nikon Zs were particularly unexpected. Both aim for the Sony's, Nikon at both the A7III and the A7RIII, Canon's basically doing the A7III competitor now. I would hope they're holding off an A7RIII competitor until they have some improved sensor tech, probably also going into the EOS 5DS Mark II."}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/Would-EOS-Sakura-beat-EOS-Naruto-or-EOS-Sasuke-Why-do-you-think-that", "question": "Would EOS Sakura beat EOS Naruto or EOS Sasuke Why do you think that", "answers": [{"upvote": 6, "content": "If they were standing still just waiting to be punched yes.

At least not for some years. The problem is, the competition is not against a camera, it's against a system. Real Soon Now, there will be the EOS R and four lenses, two of which occupy essentially the same niche as normal zoom, and the two others, primes within that same normal to slightly wide range. That's a fine start, but it's just a start.  A System Needs To Be a System  Canon and Nikon are powerhouses largely because they have a huge installed based of system components: batteries, flash, camera bodies, but most of all, lenses. If you are currently a Canon shooter with an investment in EF glass, the Canon R might be an interesting way to experiment with mirrorless. If you don't have an investment in a mirrorless system, this is not the system for you.  The L-Mount System  Take the smallest established system on the planet, the Leica L-Mount mirrorless system. This consists of 4 APS-C bodies, one FF body, four APS-C primes, three APS-C zooms, five FF primes, and three FF zooms. And, of course, adapters to each of Leica's three other lens mounts (M, R, S, as well as Leica-made adapters for a few other systems). And Leica's kind of a special case, given the exclusive pricing. There's no specific word from Nikon or Canon yet if either the Z or R systems will have APS-C cameras. Those have been supported in professional form on the DSLR platforms.  However, I have to now insert \\u2014 ** breaking news ** \\u2014 that of course, as many already know, Panasonic and Sigma are now teaming up with Leica on L-Mount cameras. Panasonic is particularly interesting, in that they have announced two L-Mount bodies, the 47-megapixel Lumix S1R and the 24-megapixel S1, now tripling the number of full-frame L-mount cameras as well as introducing the industry's highest resolution mirrorless full-frame and second-highest resolution full frame of all, second only to the Canon 5Ds. They're including IBIS, weather sealing, dual card slots (SD and XQD), 4Kp60 video (though no additional details yet), etc. Basically already answering many of the criticisms of the Canon and Nikon offerings, but until pricing and more details are announced, questions still lurk. But unlike Canon and Sony, Panasonic hasn't held back on video features in the past, I would expect these to be the go-to over Sony, Canon, and Nikon for large sensor video.  One big caveat: the DFD technology. Panasonic's DFD + CDAF technology works fairly well as an alternative to the typical hybrid PDAF + CDAF autofocus. But they're going to have to convince potential customers, and avoid the issues they have in Micro Four Thirds. In m43, while Panasonic, Olympus, and many others share a lens mount, Panasonic's the only one with DFD, and other companies' lenses don't contain DFD data. Leica's single SL body, the Leica SL (Typ 601), is CDAF only. Many photographers would reject a $6,000 body with CDAF-only. Or a $3,000 body for that matter. As well, hybrid OIS + IBIS only works in-company \\u2014 you can't use hybrid stabilization with an Olympus lens on a Panny body or vice versa. They need better cooperation in the L-mount alliance\\u2026 maybe even backport some of that to m43!  The E-Mount System  Sony currently has the largest established full frame mirrorless sytem on the market with the FE spin on the E-Mount system. They've released 9 full-frame, 19 APS-C, and 9 camcorders based on this mount. And they currently offer 18 APS-C and 30 full-frame lenses, with another 12 officially announced to be released Real Soon Now\\u2026 well, Sony actually said soon and implied starting in 2019, at their Photokina press conference (today, September 25, 2018).  Sony's been strong enough in video to lure away video shooters from Canon, largely because Canon's been avoiding 4K for years, and even now seems to cripple it in some way in every camera they've released outside of their Cinema EOS line. Panasonic has even better support, if you don't need full frame, but if you think you do, Sony's been the only game in town.  And of course, Sony controls sensors. They make over 40% of all image sensors on the planet, including those used in every camera. They also manufacture sensors for some companies, like Nikon for example, even when those companies do their own designs. So it's likely an even high percentage than that. As the competition heats up, controlling your own state-of-the-art sensor seems more critical than ever.  The X-Mount System  Fujifilm has been in mirrorless since 2012, and they hit the ground running with a unique camera, the X-Pro 1. This was the only hybrid viewfinder camera, offering both EVF and electronic-assist rangefinder, a pretty innovative approach. They've been the only company other than Olympus, far as I've seen, really thinking about the needs of the still photographer, and how to apply  The X-system consists of 24 lenses, but again with emphasis on professional and enthusiast use. They have the largest collection of prime lenses from a single vendor at 14 (Olympus is second at 12) in the mirrorless world. Fujifilm has expanded the X-system, offering at least 17 bodies since their start, covering more rangefinder-like, SLR-like, consumer, and very recently, video markets.  And they keep doing interesting stuff\\u2026 for Photokina, they just announced a XF33mm F1.0 R lens. And it's also autofocus. All of the existing f/0.95 lenses on the market (this is the first f/1.0 announced for mirrorless), including the announced Nikon 58mm f/0.95 for their shiny new Z system, are manual focus.  Fujifilm seems to attact two sorts of users: those who loved the system and didn't care about the difference between APS-C and full-frame, and those still using full-frame, perhaps professionally, who got into the Fujifilm X-series to play around with mirrorless. You also see many of those second sort slowly mutate into the first sort as they take their X-series gear along, leave the DSLRs at home, and still get great photographs. That's exactly how I got into Micro Four Thirds, as well.  Neither Canon, Sony, Nikon, nor Leica/Panasonic have yet aimed directly at Fujifilm, for the most part. Nikon's Df is maybe the one exception.  Micro Four Thirds  The largest mirrorless system is Micro Four Thirds, which has offered over its ten year existence over 140 lenses, 57 bodies ranging from consumer cameras, professional cameras, video-centric still cameras, camcorder/cinema cameras, drone cameras and crashcams, etc.  Unless you're one of those folks who buys an ILC and just one lens, you can't really go all-in on Canon EOS R or Nikon Z. I do think it'll take 4\\u20135 years before there are enough lenses to make the system attractive to those who don't already own components. In the meantime, both companies have to keep up, Sony-style, with new camera body offerings, so that potential users get a good idea of where they're moving these systems. Is Canon always going to cripple 4K video? Does Nikon fully embrace the Z, or is it only going to be a sideline? Will there be APS-C bodies? Consumer bodies? Are most of the R lenses really going to be $2,000+? Are we stuck forever with the relatively tiny-for-mirrorless-but-DSLR-compatible batteries? Lots of questions that will take years to fully answer.  So, Why R (and Z)?  So Canon's EOS R and Nikon's Z are two things. In general, they're here to start to establish a line of mirrorless cameras that extend from enthusiast to professional for both companies. They are finally convinced that mirrorless isn't a toy. Canon's already been more successful than we necessarily see in the USA with their consumer-only EOS M system. They've been the #2 mirrorless camera in Japan for 2\\u20133 years, second only to Olympus, despite only competing in the consumer market. They have a good chance of becoming the top mirrorless brand in Japan this year.  But until there's a system, the EOS R is for existing Canon customers, as the Nikon Z pair are for existing Nikon users. These will work perfectly with adapters, better than Sony works with adapters. And that's the second point: Canon and Nikon have been losing customers to Sony. Sure, some folks have switched to other systems. This year I made the final jump to being fully on Micro Four Thirds for my system cameras, selling off my Canon FF system. Others have moved to Fujifilm's excellent APS-C based system, which has more prime lens offerings from a single vendor than any other mirrorless system (even Olympus, by two).  But if you demand full-frame, Sony's been the only game in town, and that's seen a bunch of Canon and Nikon pick up a Sony and a Metabones adapter to try out mirrorless, and gradually move over. That's actually how I got into m43\\u2026 five years ago, I bought a Pen Mini just to replace a broken P&S camera. So both Canon and Nikon immediately see these mirrorless offerings as stemming the flow of customers to Sony, if their main goal is just adding mirrorless.  But today, if you're not starting out with a collection of expensive glass, Sony's the only FF game in town. They still have the overall worst lineup of lenses in mainsteam mirrorless, but they have plugged enough holes that they're a reasonable choice for someone just starting out. And of course, being fundamentally an electronics company as well as the big dog in image sensor chips, Sony is cutting edge on camera bodies, at least when they don't hold back to protect other markets (Panasonic is still ahead on video, thanks to that, for those not shooting in total darkness on an A7S).  You Want War? You Got War?  It's interesting that, up until recently, you had less direct competition in mirrorless. If you demanded full-frame, you bought Sony. If you were a bit more flexible and wanted top video support, you bought Panasonic. If you wanted top notch stills support, it was Olympus or Fujifilm, depending on just what you were looking for. And of course, m43 ensured compatibility between Olympus and Panasonic.  Now we have FOUR competing full frame systems! If you do video, you'd be silly to buy a Nikon, Canon, or Sony until more is known about the Panasonic S series, given that today, Panasonic's Micro Four Thirds offering outperform full frame video in many different areas. And for awhile, the L-System is going to be smallish and expensive, while the Z and R systems are going to be tiny, playing catch-up, likely for a good 5 years.  While it does vary by year, it's hard to imagine that any of these create a huge spike in new camera sales. Maybe all collectively move the needle a bit, but digital has been a mature market for awhile, and few shooters really need a new camera right now. Camera sales are down to where they were before the digital bubble \\u2014 actually a bit lower, since the bottom of the P&S market was eaten up by smartphones.  So this may well be a war, with all these companies strugging to keep their existing customers, attract new ones, etc. If nothing else, it looks like great theater!  Going Forward  In five years or so, both Canon and Nikon will have a good if not superior set of mirrorless glass, and they'll be able to compete with other companies. Again, the real target is Sony. Leica people buy Leicas, the other 99.9% don't, but they may well like what Panasonic and Sigma do in the now far more interesting L-Mount system. If you aren't convinced you need FF, you probably already have a Fujifilm, Olympus, or Panasonic system \\u2014 they've been pushing tech on everything but the sensor design longer and harder than Sony, much less these mirrorless newcomers :-) For working pros, it's going to take more glass, some real professional bodies, etc. But I have no reason to believe that Canon or Nikon won't be able to make it. They do have the two largest installed bases of DSLR tech, and as such, a huge customer base. Those customers will have to evaluate these offerings for themselves, but at least they have that reality now, and not just the maybe we all had a month-and-a-half ago.  It will be interesting. Canon and Nikon originally decided that mirrorless was maybe for consumers, maybe just a fad. They both entered that early enough; the Nikon 1 was out in 2011, only three years after Panasonic jump-started the whole mirrorless market with the G1 in 2008. But it was overpriced, too much form over function I think. Canon did much better with EOS M, but still, it had no professional chance. If you were one of those photographers who worshipped at the church of Canikon, you might well have belived their assertion about mirrorless. Now that they have made their ex cathedra approvals of professional mirrorless, we're at another inflection point.  For one, is mirrorless a migration or an alternative? Digital was pretty much a migration. The chemical still photography market vanished in less than a decade. APS-C/Micro Four Thirds, on the other hand, are alternatives. The market will, of course, make this decision: do DSLR live or die? That's maybe a little bold given that in 2017, they were 65% of ILC market, versus 35% mirrorless. But mirrorless has been growing, DSLR shrinking for much longer than that.  If you're a DSLR user today with an investment in glass, the R or Z is maybe just what the doctor ordered. But if you're convinced there's a migration, if you're not invested in lenses, the fact that Canon and Nikon have just put their blessing on mirrorless doesn't mean you buy their systems.

I almost gave up too until i came across CryptoFXnetwork Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www . cryptofxnetwork . com) where i get profit on my invested cryptocurrency after 10 trading days. Don't be left out. Be like me. I still believe in Cryptocurrency. Please Note: This is me just telling you about my personal experience so far so good about investing on the only legit cryptocurrency investment platform i have seen online, I am in no way trying to advertise or give you a financial advise on how to spend your money. You can make your research and if you find the platform deem fit then you can go ahead just like i did.  When it was first launched, the price of the EOS cryptocurrency sat at $2.29. However, it then doubled in less than 24 hours, with EOS hitting $5.40.  This hike did not last, however, and the coin soon started falling, breaking one support level after another. EOS found its bottom at $0.59, which is where it remained until late October 2017. Once the crypto bull run that marked the year reached its peak, EOS joined the rally, and it skyrocketed to $16.39 on January 13, 2018.  However, while most coins peaked around this date or earlier, EOS' all-time high came later, in April 2018. In mid-April, the crypto market \\u2013 which had been crashing since January \\u2013 started seeing a new bullish wave. Prices started going up, and many assumed that the so-called 'crypto winter' was over.  These days, we know that the surge in April was only the eye of the storm, as the crash continued as May 2018 arrived. But, for those few weeks, the EOS price jumped once more, breaking its former record, and going up to $22.89. This was the coin's highest price, and it has never reached these highs again, at least so far.  Following this second surge, EOS kept dropping, briefly stopped by support here and there, but eventually, it dropped to its new bottom at $1.86 around December 7, 2018. In 2019, the coin saw gradual growth, although it progressed slowly, and everything it had achieved by mid-2019 was undone in the second half of the year, as it slowly returned to the level where it sat ever since \\u2013 between $2 and $2.8.  The EOS price has fluctuated in this range, except for on three occasions in 2020. The first one was between mid-January and mid-February, when it joined another bull run that took it to $5.35. The second was in August 2020, when it hit $3.7, and the last one is right now, led by Bitcoin (BTC), which is once again approaching its all-time highs at $20,000.  EOS, on the other hand, is as far away from its own record as it can be, hovering around $3.26.  What is happening to EOS these days?  Unfortunately, EOS has not been making headlines in 2020, as the crypto industry is mostly focused on the decentralised finance (DeFi) sector. When DeFi started slowing down, bull runs took over, and most of the attention went to Bitcoin.  However, that does not mean that EOS has been doing nothing. Its developers at Block.one recently announced the EOS Resource Model proposal, and the soon-to-arrive review of various talented organisations that responded to the company's invitation to evaluate their code.  Block.one also recently expressed its pleasure with how Spielworks built a rewards and loyalty platform for gamers using EOSIO.  The company also worked on adding new features to its Training and Certification segment of the blockchain.  And, of course, as a development platform, EOS has also been making moves to attract people to develop new DeFi projects on its network. The network already has quite a few successful projects, although the majority of the developers are still focusing on developing DeFi on Ethereum.  EOS price prediction 2021: what to expect from EOS going forward?  Lastly, we arrive at the most interesting part \\u2014 EOS coin price prediction for 2021 and beyond.  According to TradingBeasts, the EOS price in December 2020 will reach a maximum of $3.4, after which the forecasting service expects it to drop back down to $2.7, on average.  In January 2021, its EOS crypto price prediction shows the coin remaining near this level, at around $2.7, later expecting it to experience a slow but steady rise throughout the year, with the coin having the potential to hit a high of $3.9 next December. The average price of EOS is predicted to reach $4.07 in December 2022, and then $5.03 in December 2023.  Wallet Investor also expects the currency's price to rise in early 2021, although their EOS coin forecast says that the asset will see a price crash in the second half of the year. The event will potentially lead EOS down to $1.2 one year from now.  As for CryptoGround, they have a very bullish EOS prediction. In fact, their EOS forecast claims that the coin will simply keep climbing, with its value reaching $4.17 in six months, $4.7 in one year, and $21.4 by December 2025."}, {"upvote": 17, "content": "EOS has the following unique benefits.  \\u25cf High transaction throughput: EOS enables the execution of millions of transactions per second, which means that it has high transaction throughput.  \\u25cf Free transactions for end-users: EOS provides the users to mine and execute a large number of transactions without any additional fees.  \\u25cf Governance based on user votes: Each transaction executed in EOS is bound to follow the rules laid down in the constitution.

EOS is, i.e. a blockchain designed as a different approach to what Ethereum accomplishes. Its consensus system is different, instead based off of Distributed Proof of Stake, and zero transaction fees. Getting around the political dispute between whether PoW, PoS, DPoS, or some other public consensus mechanism is the best, EOS is distinct from Ethereum, and has its own currency.  Here's the confusing part. EOS, like many other blockchains, held ICOs on Ethereum. A smart contract existed where users could dump ETH into the contract in exchange for ERC-20 tokens of EOS. Stakeholders of this ERC-20 token could trade it, but the token had no effect until EOS was actually deployed as its own network.  Before EOS was deployed, the smart contract was frozen on Ethereum, preventing all movement of EOS tokens. Before this happened, stakeholders had the opportunity to register their addresses and their EOS stake so that they could access it on the EOS network after release. This freezing meant the end of the EOS token's use on Ethereum.  EOS's network now sustains its own currency, which is distinct from the token on Ethereum. Because the EOS blockchain was release in a publically verifiable way, users knew that they weren't being cheated because their tokens were all present in the new blockchain.  TL;DR EOS tokens are on Ethereum, and can no longer be used due to a smart contract freeze. They were changed into EOS coins which are hosted on the actual EOS mainnet, where the tokens can freely move."}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/Who-would-win-Deku-or-Natsu", "question": "Who would win Deku or Natsu", "answers": [{"upvote": 25, "content": "One-sided battle, Deku obviously takes the WIN guys.

For one, both of them are the types of fighters who wouldn't fall for cheap tricks and second is that they both have similar range of dodging lightning. However, Natsu his senses and tactics to study his opponents way better and is way way faster than Esdeath.  Esdeath's ice constructs and standard arsenal meant that she had more weaponry and versatility up her sleeve. However, it isn't really new to Natsu since he had experience fighting with Ice-Make Wizard Gray Fullbuster who also does the same type of abilities Esdeath can do.  Natsu does have different types of Dragon modes up his sleeve which also gives him another feat of versatility as well and his Dragon Modes wouldn't be as predictable as Esdeath's ice constructs.  As Esdeath uses Ice Constructs throughout her fights, her amount of weaponry would be quite easy for Natsu to dodge or counter out. Since Esdeath doesn't know who Natsu is, Natsu unleashing his Dragon Modes would be more of a surprise to her. Even if Esdeath is not surprised, it wouldn't be enough to counter out Natsu's advantages.  That is when Esdeath used her Ice Storm that outputted 280 Petatons of TNT. But remember that it took her a few days to stockpile her power through absorbing her Ice Cavalry.  \\\"A few\\\" means 3 at minimum, lowballing this to her daily basis meaning Esdeath's Ice Storm can output at least 93 Petatons of TNT. But even if we didn't lowball it, Natsu's Half Dragon Transformation outputted more power at least 4.9 Exatons of TNT thanks to overpowering and defeating a Dragon Cry powered Animus.  (But couldn't Esdeath had overpowered Natsu when he was at base)?  Well not really, Natsu is bound to use any of his Dragon Modes when his base Dragon Slayer abilities aren't enough. But if we used his base power, remember how he defeated a Fairy Heart empowered Zeref?  Other magics like Thought Projection would be useful, however it wasn't really needed. Note that Natsu has used his Flames of Emotion in conjunction to his magic.  That part where he overpowered his brother.  Unfortunately it is impossible to tell the range and limits of Zeref's magic power while in that form, but what we do know is that it surpass the magic power of all of the Spriggan 12 members. So let's scale with one of the members of the Spriggan 12: August.  Also know as the Wizard King and one of the strongest of the Spriggan 12.  Despite the sheer amount of magic August can make, he still has limits as shown when he was shocked by Acnologia's power and his sacrificial spell. Note that August's magic nullification was only a hax ability. While he also attacked Natsu one time with a giant flame pillar, Natsu wasn't hurt or injured by the attack which proves he can take hits even from August. This is further supported when Natsu can take hits from powerful foes like Acnologia and Mercuphobia in base form.  At full power August can use a sacrificial spell called Ars Magia which uses all of his magic power to destroy land at least the size of Fiore. \\\"At least\\\" usually means equal or more than that amount. If we use the same map of Fiore to find the longest range Ars Magia reach, August's full magic can apply way more than 340 Petatons of TNT.  That is way more than Shikoutazer's power and way more than Esdeath's stockpiled Ice Storm. So since Natsu was able to overpower that much magic power fighting with Fairy Heart Zeref, even his own power is capable enough to overpower Esdeath. So that means there is one more move Esdeath could do.  Esdeath was shown to be unaffected by a Blaze Ball Teigu which is hot enough to burn through human flesh. However, this is likely done by a weaker person and hardly comparable to the sheer amount of heat Natsu can release.  Esdeath's Time Stop Mahapadma is a move that she can only use once a day. It is considered her last resort move Esdeath does when she is ever overpowered or in near death situations.  But Natsu not only has been shown to withstand cold temperatures, but he has other feats that can resist Esdeath's Time Stop.  A cold resistance can help move against Mahapadma, but is still affected to the Time Stop slowing them down. However, nothing suggest that Esdeath's Time Stop can stop or slow anything countering Time Manipulation.  Being revived as a demon E.N.D. meant that Natsu can resist time stop very easily. But even in base form, Natsu was able to burn through time manipulation from Zeref. Otherwise, Zeref would have tried to reverse time again in that final blow. Note how Esdeath's Mahapadma can only freeze time for a short period of time, Fairy Heart Zeref has full control of all time and space itself.  Natsu has burned through many things that has restricted him before like Genesis Zero, Stigmata and Ankhseram Black Magic. Zeref in base form also possesses a time stopping ability as part of his Black Arts magic.  And the Mahapadma drains Esdeath's energy as well, so that means her time stop is useless. Even with all the abilities and effort Esdeath could pull out would only be a sheer annoyance to Natsu rather than a threat.  While Esdeath's versatility, skills and time stop were impressive, it was not enough for her to compete against Natsu's speed, senses, tactics, ridiculous amount of power and unpredictable Dragon Abilities to finish the job.

Canon 1300D is a DSLR where you can interchange lenses and the zoom depends on the focal length of the lens. You can buy longer focal length lenses if you want. The kit lenses are 18\\u201355mm and 55\\u2013250mm. If you buy both lenses then you have a zoom ratio of 250/18 = 13.8X"}, {"upvote": 19, "content": "Optical zoom is calculated by the lens focal length devided by its wide angle numbers.

So\\u2026 to under the lens and its X factor (zoom), please read..  18mm the first number represent how wide that lens can see and capture, so first number is the angle of the field of view. Smaller the first number wider that lens can see and capture the picture.  Second number represents how much further that lens can zoom, in this case it goes upto 55mm, which is called its Optical Zoom.  So to find out the zoom ratio devide its telephoto number by its wide angle number..  55 \\u00f7 18 = 3.05  So that lens has 3X optical zoom.. its that simple.! That means while zooming / going from 18 to 55 its brings the subject 3 times (3x) closer.  This is true and works for all types of zoom lenses. you simply look for these two numbers on lens it is usually embossed printed (first smaller number which is its wide angle and second number which is its telephoto, and simply do  T \\u00f7 W = X  Where (X is the zoom).  But, but.. the DSLR body does not have anything to do with zoom, what if you attach a 55\\u2013300mm lens to the same body now see the calculations..  300 \\u00f7 55 = 5.45X.

The typical stuck lens cap we see is caused by impact or by dropping the camera. This causes the cap to sink inward on one side of the lens and the resulting pressure makes the cap difficult to remove.  Before doing anything, place the camera on a solid surface where it won't slip off if you get too enthusiastic with pushing things. Usually, slight pressure with a fingernail under the cap to wedge it loose is all that is required. However, if this fails, using a plastic knife as a wedge is next. Beyond that, increasing the thickness of the tool used or two tools spread to each side of the cap (two plastic knives, one on top of the other or one on each side) will dislodge the cap. Do not use hammers, metal tools or extreme force. You will damage the auto focus mechanism of the lens or the filter trim ring. Take your time and use gentle pressure only. It will come loose."}, {"upvote": 7, "content": "I looked at some other answers. And they give good advice. Mainly they say hold on to your 1300D and spend money on lenses. But I'm not going to give you advice. Instead, I'll answer your question.  Now it's good to know whether you want to continue with an APS-C camera, or move up to full frame. If you want to stay with cropped, I like the 80D. You may not see much difference in your pictures, but there are several features that facilitate shooting, like brighter finder, articulated touch screen, and custom settings. My experience with the EF-S lenses is that they are optically fine but a little short in build. On the plus side you can build an arsenal of superb lenses that will have most ranges covered, for a modest investment. The 80D is due for an update soon. Keep your eye out for bargains.  If you want to go full frame, I like the 6Dii, though I still use a 6D, myself. (But I'm retired.) Bargains on 6Ds are also around.

But you may not want to bother about these numbers especially for an entry-level DSLR.  * Canon 1300d supports Built in WiFi and NFC . Nikon 3400d lacks this connectivity option even though it supports Bluetooth. WiFi and NFC comes really handy when you would like to transfer the photos into your smartphone and take a quick look at it.  * Nikon d3400 Sensor is larger than Canon 1300d. It brings much better quality images. Keep in mind that, when two cameras have same size sensor and one of them has higher MP, then there is a chance that noise get increased in images.  * For videography canon is way better than nikon, even though the latter offers 60fps rate. (30fps vs 60fps) Eventhough there are some other difference, I am not going to point them out, since they won't make much difference.  Also if you can increse your budget I insist you to take a look at Nikon d5300 and Canon 700d.

It's a book aimed at amateur photographers that have access to a SLR camera, fast lenses and fast films, and some of the techniques there can be used with digital cameras too.  You can resume the technique as wide aperture, fast ISO, and steady hand for low shutter speeds.  1. Use a good lens with wide aperture, like f/2 or f/1.8. That is a fast lens. It's called fast because with the wide aperture, you can use faster shutter speeds; 2. Use ISO 400 or ISO 800. The brochure talks about ISO 400, the faster film you can buy as an amateur at the time. Faster films would be ISO 800, and be Black and White. Digital photography can achieve this speed and faster; 3. Use shutter speeds equal to the reciprocal of the focal length or even 2 to 4 stops slower. If you have a 50mm lens, the shutter speed can be 1/50 (the reciprocal), 1/12 (2 stops slower), or even 1/4 (~4 stops slower), but make sure to tell your subject to stop moving, activate the image stabilization of the camera (in a Canon it's in the lens, if it have it - the popular Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 lens don't have image stabilization), and use some technique for stabilization of the camera. That's it. It will work with any camera, and you can make good photos with this.

You can also keep your shutter open longer to ensure sufficient time for the light to fall on the sensor. But if there are any moving objects in your composition they will appear blur (can be a great creative picture). Also you need something to keep your camera very still. A tripod is a must if you want keep shutter open for anything longer than half second.  You can also increase iso and then delete noise in post processing.  In real life you will use a combination of these three variables to get a good low light shot.  For portraits open shutter wider and keep a reasonably high shutter speed. Ensure your subject is in focus. Use image stabilization.  For landscape use a tripod and go for a small aoperture (f10 and above) to ensure everything is in sharp focus. Allow enough time for shutter to remain open to get a good exposure. When using tripod ensure emage stabilization is turned off and you use a remote control or delayed shot to ensure the mirror movement does not cause any shake. No need to jack up iso as you can keep shutter open longer. It is normal to keep shutter open for 30sec.  Also during low light conditions play with exposure compensation to ensure you get the right dark ambiance (if that's what you are looking for). Typically dial down exposure by couple of stops.

You can make your research and if you find the platform deem fit then you can go ahead just like i did.  When it was first launched, the price of the EOS cryptocurrency sat at $2.29. However, it then doubled in less than 24 hours, with EOS hitting $5.40.  This hike did not last, however, and the coin soon started falling, breaking one support level after another. EOS found its bottom at $0.59, which is where it remained until late October 2017. Once the crypto bull run that marked the year reached its peak, EOS joined the rally, and it skyrocketed to $16.39 on January 13, 2018.  However, while most coins peaked around this date or earlier, EOS' all-time high came later, in April 2018. In mid-April, the crypto market \\u2013 which had been crashing since January \\u2013 started seeing a new bullish wave. Prices started going up, and many assumed that the so-called 'crypto winter' was over.  These days, we know that the surge in April was only the eye of the storm, as the crash continued as May 2018 arrived. But, for those few weeks, the EOS price jumped once more, breaking its former record, and going up to $22.89. This was the coin's highest price, and it has never reached these highs again, at least so far.  Following this second surge, EOS kept dropping, briefly stopped by support here and there, but eventually, it dropped to its new bottom at $1.86 around December 7, 2018. In 2019, the coin saw gradual growth, although it progressed slowly, and everything it had achieved by mid-2019 was undone in the second half of the year, as it slowly returned to the level where it sat ever since \\u2013 between $2 and $2.8.  The EOS price has fluctuated in this range, except for on three occasions in 2020. The first one was between mid-January and mid-February, when it joined another bull run that took it to $5.35. The second was in August 2020, when it hit $3.7, and the last one is right now, led by Bitcoin (BTC), which is once again approaching its all-time highs at $20,000.  EOS, on the other hand, is as far away from its own record as it can be, hovering around $3.26.  What is happening to EOS these days?  Unfortunately, EOS has not been making headlines in 2020, as the crypto industry is mostly focused on the decentralised finance (DeFi) sector. When DeFi started slowing down, bull runs took over, and most of the attention went to Bitcoin.  However, that does not mean that EOS has been doing nothing. Its developers at Block.one recently announced the EOS Resource Model proposal, and the soon-to-arrive review of various talented organisations that responded to the company's invitation to evaluate their code.  Block.one also recently expressed its pleasure with how Spielworks built a rewards and loyalty platform for gamers using EOSIO.  The company also worked on adding new features to its Training and Certification segment of the blockchain.  And, of course, as a development platform, EOS has also been making moves to attract people to develop new DeFi projects on its network. The network already has quite a few successful projects, although the majority of the developers are still focusing on developing DeFi on Ethereum.  EOS price prediction 2021: what to expect from EOS going forward?  Lastly, we arrive at the most interesting part \\u2014 EOS coin price prediction for 2021 and beyond.  According to TradingBeasts, the EOS price in December 2020 will reach a maximum of $3.4, after which the forecasting service expects it to drop back down to $2.7, on average.  In January 2021, its EOS crypto price prediction shows the coin remaining near this level, at around $2.7, later expecting it to experience a slow but steady rise throughout the year, with the coin having the potential to hit a high of $3.9 next December. The average price of EOS is predicted to reach $4.07 in December 2022, and then $5.03 in December 2023.  Wallet Investor also expects the currency's price to rise in early 2021, although their EOS coin forecast says that the asset will see a price crash in the second half of the year. The event will potentially lead EOS down to $1.2 one year from now.  As for CryptoGround, they have a very bullish EOS prediction. In fact, their EOS forecast claims that the coin will simply keep climbing, with its value reaching $4.17 in six months, $4.7 in one year, and $21.4 by December 2025."}, {"upvote": 3, "content": "%3E What is EOS, and what does it do?

Ethereum, one of the most talked about blockchain platforms, is competing to become the next generation foundation for building applications. However, it is now under threat from what has been described as the Ethereum killer.  EOS, is the latest blockchain platform out of the blocks. It is causing a stir amongst blockchain experts, who are super excited by its potential. Analysts say it is will make other blockchain platforms obsolete.  Here are 5 reason why EOS might make Ethereum obsolete  EOS has superior technology compared to Ethereum  EOS was developed after the proliferation of multiple blockchain experiments like Ethereum. All of them attempt to lure in developers, enterprises and users to their platform. Unfortunately, the limits of their technology are a drag on what is possible.  Ethereum, suffers a limitation of transactional throughput. Because of a process known as serialization, transactions on it are limited to being processed sequentially. Therefore, all processes that go through its blockchain, cannot be processed simultaneously. Instead, they have to be processed in the order they are received relative to other transactions.  The EOS platform, recognized this limitation, and solved it by implementing asynchronous communication and parallel processing of transactions. This means multiple transactions running on EOS do not have to queue and wait their turn. Rather, they all get processed together, simultaneously on a distributed network. This is a remarkable feat in transactional capacity.  With this capability, EOS can handle more transactions, scale faster and to a wider audience than what is possible with Ethereum.  EOS can process more transactions per second than Ethereum  For blockchain platforms to become successful, they need to accommodate a ton of traffic on their network. The number of transactions a network can handle per second is a metric for comparing blockchain performance.  At its peak on June 11th, 2017, Ethereum experienced one of its highest traffic on the network. Unfortunately, even at its peak, it could only handle a throughput of 5.2 transactions per second. In the cryptocurrency world, this may seem impressive. However, for commercial grade applications, it is merely a drop in the bucket. With hundreds of banks, governments and major companies looking to build blockchain applications, much more is required.  EOS identified the folly of the current blockchain transaction capacity models. So they have implemented asynchronous communication and parallelization. With parallelization, multiple transactions are processed simultaneously, enabling horizontal scalability of the network. In addition, EOS has adopted Graphene technology, which has been proved to achieve 10,000 - 100,000 transactions per second.  Combining both technologies, EOS can achieve a modest 300,000 transactions per second. But, this is only the beginning. The road map is to scale to process 1 million transactions per second. EOS will support the bandwidth requirements of commercial and enterprise grade applications. For context, facebook and google handle about 52,000 and 40,000 transactions per second respectively.  Mass adoption of blockchains boils down to the scaling ability of platforms. EOS has scalability at the core of its design.  EOS has zero transactions fees while Ethereum's fees are going higher  Blockchain networks typically consume resources for security and processing. The de facto approach has been to pay the owners of resources. Miners collect fees from users to keep the network running. This design however, is detrimental to lowering the barrier of adoption.  The Ethereum blockchain enables developers to build decentralized applications at no cost. The downside is users pay the price for consuming the network's resources. Users of Ethereum applications have to pay fees for every transaction processed by miners. Every storage operation, bandwidth use and calculation has to pay gas fees which is expressed in Ether. The amount of fees is calculated based on the complexity of the transaction.  If users do not pay enough fees, their transactions are excluded. It is worse because fees can change at any time and there is no way to predict in advance.  EOS was built from the ground up to do away with this insane model. To onboard users en mass, it needs to be cheap to use applications on platforms. For this reasons, transactions on EOS incur zero fees. This model eliminates the hassle of purchasing cryptocurrency to pay network fees. Additionally, developers also do not incur any cost to run applications on EOS. All they need, is to hold a certain number of EOS tokens that assures them a preset allocation of bandwidth.  EOS's zero fee approach to onboarding users and developers on its platform is by far superior to Ethereum's pay to use fee model.  EOS's Daniel Larimer has more experience building blockchain versus Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin  Blockchain's are a relatively new technology, that combine decades worth of prior art. It takes years of experience programming in different fields and a big picture view of the future to build one.  Vitalik Buterin, was barely out of high school when he set out to build the Ethereum blockchain. He started out as a cryptocurrency writer for Bitcoin magazine and opted not to go to college. 14 months later, he joined teams working on digital assets protocols - Mastercoin and Coloured coins.  While on these projects, he witnessed first hand the limitation of protocols built on Bitcoin. So he conceived the idea of Ethereum, an independent blockchain in 2014, but lacked the developer skills to build it from scratch. He had to find other developers to help him make Ethereum a reality.  Dan Larimer on the other hand, graduated from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in 2003 with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science. He worked on various projects such as a virtual reality simulator and unmanned vehicle control systems.  In the early days, Dan worked closely with Satoshi Nakamoto refining bitcoin. He realized its shortcomings and moved on to build a high performance decentralized exchange known as BitShares. 2 years later, he built Steemit, a social media site powered by blockchain. Steemit is hailed as the most user friendly blockchain to date.  Dan's ground breaking technology Graphene was used for both Bitshares and Steemit. Both combined have more blockchain transaction activity per day than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitshares processes between 600,000 - 700,000 transactions per day, while Steemit handles 120,000 transactions per day.  As the CTO of EOS, Dan has brought his experience, lessons and technology from previous projects. EOS combines all the great qualities of Bitshares and Steemit to come up with a superior blockchain platform.  Final Thought  People don't realize that there are other ways to earn great profits on cryptocurrency rather than just buying them. For example, investing with trusted Non-Ponzi cryptocurrency investment companies for profits, companies like Cryptobond (www.cryptobond.tech) pay double your cryptocurrencies (Ethereum, EOS and others) in 7 days of investment, isn't that great?  Developers, entrepreneurs, Banks, fortune 500 companies and governments have expressed interest in building blockchain applications. Current blockchain platforms such as Ethereum are limited in scalability, fees and throughput. They were not designed from the ground up with commercial applications in mind. Attempting to do the major changes necessary now is like trying to disassemble an engine while it is running  EOS is building a blockchain platform for scale, ease of use and millions of transactions per second. It is incorporating the lessons and failure of existing blockchain models. With an eye on the future of commercial adoption, EOS has a leg up on Ethereum, by building to remedy the failures."}, {"upvote": 5, "content": "Most likely it will when the market becomes bullish again and people start going to crypto exchanges like Binance, Primexbt, Kraken etc\\u2026 to buy heavily out of fomo.

Moreover, the creators of EOS have also decided not to define this acronym and use it as it is formally. BlockOne has developed it; whereas, its core developer is BM (Daniel Larimer).  EOS has the ability to support all core and fundamental functionalities required by different businesses to enable themselves along with other people to make blockchain-based DApps in a similar fashion so that of the web-based applications.  These applications are hosted with functionalities like safe and sound access and authentication provisioning, permission, usage management, data hosting, and smooth communication between the end-users, DApp, and the Internet.  The EOS blockchain aims to build such a platform that can perform millions of transactions per second. These transactions are to be performed without any additional cost.  In EOS, blocks are produced by Block Producers, just like miners produce them in Ethereum. Once the blocks are generated, they are being paid by EOS blockchain instead of the users paying for them.  EOS blockchain system has a built-in inflation system that helps in the maintenance and proportion of an ecosystem. In EOS, two blocks are produced simultaneously every second.

But even so, I don't consider myself to be a professional.  To me, the word professional is very ambiguous. The real meaning of the word \\\"professional\\\" is that you are making a living out of your photography, so in this case the camera must be able to produce photos with image quality that surpass the minimum photo-publishing requirements. In this case, a 700D with its 18MP Canon sensor that's also being used in the 7D meets the requirement, as the image quality produced by the 700D will satisfy at the very least the minimum standard requirement of many photographers; so it's safe to say it's good enough to be considered a \\\"professional camera\\\". A lot of low-budget studios where I live, which I consider to be professional photography studio, even still use the good-old 500D for passport headshots and similar stuffs, and they make money from it; that makes the 500D a \\\"professional camera\\\". I'm pretty sure that the photos from the 700D are also good enough to even get pass the very strict requirement of a lot of professional stock photography agencies. So there's that one kind of professional.    On the other hand, the assumed meaning of the word \\\"professional camera\\\" that the camera manufacturers and marketing departments tried to emphasize to us is the camera with the most feature packed with a very high price-level. Well, in this case, the 700D is not a professional camera, and the manufacturer will push you towards a 7D, 5D or 1D, in hope that you'll buy those products with a much higher margin to both cover the operational cost of the manufacturer and make more profit for the company. They don't care if you make a living out of your camera or not, but the 7D, 6D, 5D, and 1D are professional cameras. That's another kind of professional.  Now let's discuss the 700D specifically. I don't personally own the 700D but I used to own a 650D for one year, and it's spec'ed very similar to the 700D. The 650D/700D can shoot 18MP RAW or JPEG with a CMOS sensor that's very similar to the sensor on the high-end Canon 7D. It does shoot at 4 or 5fps burst image, it shoot 30fps video at 1080p, it has a decent viewfinder, and a good all-around control as well as menu.   Upgrading from a 650D/700D to a 7D, a \\\"professional\\\" camera, will give you faster burst image at 8fps, weather-sealing, better view-finder, more extensive manual control, and a heavier body. But it will not give you a better image quality.   Upgrading to a 5D Mark III will give you a somewhat cleaner image quality at high ISO, better control, better viewfinder, weather-sealing, better video output, but you're back with 5fps burst speed, and you'll have to invest to full-frame lenses.   Upgrading to 1D, you'll get 7D fast-performance with an almost-5D-like image quality, but it'll cost you as much as a used decent car.  Now the important question that you'll have to ask for yourself is: will you make more money if you have a 7D, 6D, 5D, or a 1D? Maybe yes, maybe no. But one thing for sure, you'll have to spend more money to buy those cameras than if you buy the 700D. Can you justify that? Do you really need to have those features on those so-called professional cameras, or can you live with just the features on the 700D?  I personally don't give too much thought about using the so-called professional cameras. As long as I can deliver the results needed by the clients or by yourself, I think I'm happy. My 650D could deliver the result that I require back then, and to my book, it's good enough. I don't know about you, nor do I know about your photography requirement, so I can't speak for you.  To conclude, I quoted a small part of David Thorpe's blog post with the title \\\"Is This Camera Professional\\\". David Thorpe is an ex-photojournalist from UK, a true professional photographer in my opinion. Here's that quote:   %3E When John Downing took the classic picture of a stunned Margaret Thatcher leaving the Imperial hotel in Brighton, England, after the IRA had bombed it, he had been having a drink in the bar. The bomb went off and John couldn't get to his room to get his \\u2018proper' cameras. But he he had a Canon Sureshot, the same as my mum used on holiday, in his pocket.  And it was on the Sureshot that the pic was made.  That makes it a professional camera in my book. Cameras are not professional, people are. An Olympus Pen in Sebastaio Delgado's hands is a professional camera. A Nikon D4 in my sister's is not. Here's the link to that blog post \\\"Is this Camera Professional?\\\" [ http://m43blog.dthorpe.net/2014/10/23/is-this-camera-professional/ ]   I hope I helped you with my answer. Good luck!  "}, {"upvote": 78, "content": "I see a lot of answers claiming \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" for photography in general. Do not get this line of thinking stuck in your head because it's not entirely true. In fact, to be honest, this statement is used many times by people who simply can't afford good gear and are jealous at those who can. If you can't afford good gear right now, that's fine; work with what you can afford and save up money to grow into better gear over time. The best camera is always the one you have with you and by this I mean, if you own a $6,500 Canon 1DX and it's sitting at home, your best camera may be the free one that came built into the phone in your pocket!  While it is true, skill is the most important aspect of almost anything, including photography, your gear and even more specifically, your lenses, are just as important. A good lens on an inexpensive camera is always better than a cheap lens on an expensive camera. If you're just starting out and looking for a camera for a beginner, try to think about what sort of photography you'll be doing. General photography such as family photos, photos of your friends, pets, etc.; landscape photography; wildlife photography; street photography, etc. If you don't know yet, that's okay but if you have a goal of developing skills specific to one of these styles, it will help with camera selection.  When getting started, I'd get something inexpensive but not so cheap that your photo quality ends up discouraging you altogether (again, this is where the \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" nonsense kicks in.) I'll cover a couple types and why they're good starter cameras. And with any camera you choose, always try to keep the camera out of \\\"automatic mode\\\" if possible so you begin to master the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  Point-and-Shoot or Camera Phone  These cameras are very inexpensive and with the newer smartphones, the camera is built right in and often takes better photos than the DSLR's from just a few years ago! This is the most inexpensive route to take (and may not cost a penny if you use the camera on your phone) and it helps you learn about composition, lighting, etc. If you're already past this point and want a camera you can grow into, the following are good options:  Traditional SLR's  I know, this is probably not what most people think of when deciding on a beginner's camera but I want to mention it because if you have one of these lying around in your house (parent's or grandparent's old camera, etc.), they're great for learning the basics of a camera with all of the digital stuff removed. SLR (single lens reflex) cameras aren't used much anymore because of the cost of operation, decreased photo quality, and lack of film processing labs, however, I think any aspiring photographer should own or at least use one because they are the \\\"original camera\\\", they are inexpensive, and they help give you a greater appreciation for the luxury of digital photography (not limited to 24-36 photos per roll, immediate results where you can see your photo seconds after taking it, easy and fast multiple frame shooting, and no cost by ruining a roll of film or wasting it on bad photos.) If you buy a traditional SLR 35mm camera, I'd go for something like the Nikon 35mm F2AS with a 50mm \\\"prime lens\\\", or similar. Here's a photo of one of mine:  Digital SLR's  Digital SLR's, or DSLR's, have been the most popular choice for many years now, they're easy to find used, and they're a good starting point in learning photography. These cameras are basically digital versions of the original SLR camera but offer much more flexibility and many more options. Whagt we're seeing right now, however, is a switch from DSLR's to \\\"mirrorless cameras\\\", including the very popular \\\"Micro Four Thirds\\\" cameras which use a smaller sensor, yet often outperform the DSLR's. I'll touch on those, below. Anyway, an inexpensive or used DSLR is a good choice for starting out and I'd recommend an entry level Canon DSLR such as one of the \\\"Rebel\\\" series cameras. I currently use a Canon 1DX which is NOT a beginner's camera, and my old Canon 5D Mark II (this is a great beginner's camera, easy to find, and inexpensive.) Here's a photo of the Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm prime lens attached:  Mirrorless Cameras  These cameras really are \\\"the future of photography\\\" although many professional photographers would scoff at you for even suggesting such a thing because just as it was when SLR's were phasing out, DSLR using pro's often get stuck in their ways and refuse to move with the times. Even today there are professional photographers who refuse to switch from SLR to DSLR! Mirrorless cameras are superior to DSLR's in almost every way: They have higher resolution (megapixels) for a fraction of the cost of DSLR's; there's no mirror flapping around making noise and causing camera vibration; they're smaller and easier to carry, many can shoot 4K and even Cinema 4K video (while Canon and Nikon refuse to adapt and offer this feature for a reasonable price in their DSLR's); and overall, they're less expensive. If you can afford one (they're often cheaper than many new DSLR's), go for it! I currently shoot with a Panasonic Lumix GH4 because I shoot photography AND I need to shoot 4K video and this camera does both. An even less expensive alternative is the Lumix GH3 which sells for around $500, a quarter of the price of the GH4. Here's a photo of the Lumix GH4, a \\\"mirrorless camera\\\":  Regardless of what you choose, unless it's a cheap $30 point-and-shoot or your phone's camera, try to make a decision on which camera format you want to grow into, otherwise you'll be wasting money on a camera and the expensive lenses that you'll end up not using when you switch to a different format.  Taking an introductory photography class or workshop is also a good idea when getting started as you'll more quickly learn the basics including aperture, exposure, shutter speed, composition, and editing.

Using one of the three available EF to RF adapters, you can use the same lenses on Canon's R-series mirrorless cameras, both full-frame and APS-C models. However, be aware that if you upgrade further to a mirrorless R-series camera, any EF lenses you own will work fine, but your kit lens and any other EF-S lenses will cause your images to be automatically cropped to a lower resolution to account for the smaller APS-C coverage area of the EF-S lenses."}, {"upvote": 3, "content": "A very good camera.

As you'll hear from most responders, it's the photographer, not the camera, that takes the picture. People who are impressed with your photos will inquire what camera did you use? It's a bit bizarre, like asking an artist what brand of paint they use. It's people's perception that since they have a camera, and can't do what you do \\u2014 it must be the camera.  Here are two of the areas that should receive your attention:   * Composition.  *   * You are capturing a three dimensional scene on a flat, two dimensional plane. How you place objects on that surface will benefit from knowing about rules of composition [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_(visual_arts) ].   * Lighting.  *   * Photo-graphy means drawing with light. Light sources vary in four main ways: intensity, color, diffusion and direction. Beside observing the subject, try to look at the light, and visualize what the camera would see.

I'll been needing to live with it for a good year :-)  I'm actually really happy to see the Canon EOS R5. I left Canon back in 2018, mostly because I was getting more out of my Olympus gear. I grokked the whole mirrorless thing, found it better than optical. I could actually use my old manual lenses much more effectively than on an DSLR.  But part of it was their basic attitude. Kasey Stern, the genius behind the Camera Conspiracies vlog, pretty much expressed my main problem with Canon. It was absolutely clear, over the years, that Canon was arbitrarily holding back the level of technology on lower-end cameras to sell higher-end cameras\\u2026 regardless of the actual cost of those features. If you're the only camera company in the world and doing that, maybe that's okay. But they were not\\u2026. there are other camera companies.  So in 2015, I had bought a few Olympus Micro Four Thirds cameras, which I was using as a secondary system\\u2026 for when I didn't want to drag along my 10kg+ Canon system. I bought the OM-D E-M5 Mark II that year. First thing to note was that, even thought this was a mid-range camera, they didn't reduce features in any way that wasn't an obvious additional expense. In fact, they introduced a bunch of new features on this model that the flagship OM-D E-M1 didn't do. A year later, they introduced a new flagship, the OM-D E-M1 Mark II, with a bunch of new features. Not long after, they put out an update that added some of those new features \\u2014 those that would reasonably work \\u2014 for my E-M5 Mark II.   Canon, on the other hand, intentionally crippled their lower-end models to drive higher-end sales. And perhaps, in a different way, they also kind of decided, for the photographer, various limits of the camera that were not necessarily natural. Their old behavior was to cripple a bunch of things. So I had a Canon 60D and added a 6D. The 60D, a much lower cost camera, had a far, far better autofocus system. They could have put something at least that good into the 6D for very little extra money, but they were more concerned about the 6D/5D competition than Nikon or anyone else competing with their offerings.  This was all through the camera, including a bunch of things that were 100% software-bases, just there to crapify the 6D versus the 5D. When you're invested in any system \\u2014 camera or otherwise \\u2014 you have a vested interest. And if you're an internet writer or pundit, your first impulse is to support and defend the things your excellent brain has found to be the best. Unfortunately, as a full-time engineer and only hobby photographer, it was all too easy for me to see how that cripple hammer had been applied. And once you get involved with a company that doesn't do that, even a little bit; a company that's actually adding new high-end features to your mid-range camera, you have a hard time sticking with the old guys.  So I was really excited to see the EOS R5. Of course, since I have not used this camera, I had to give you all my ideas here rather than a real review. But also, I'm hoping this goes beyond the R5 and changes the way Canon is thinking. I knew Canon had some technology issues\\u2026 here, they've solved that a bit, but they're also leaving it up to the user how they'd like to deal with camera limitations. As a result, you have limited features not offered by anyone else.   I noticed back in 2018 how Canon was going about their EOS R business. They introduced the original EOS R as a low-cost mirrorless, relative to the EOS 5D Mark IV, that had the same sensor and, ideally, same image quality. But they crippled it a bit, to ensure it wasn't quite a pro-grade match to the 5D. And yet, that also made it cheaper.  So get inside Canon's head for a moment. The EOS R was not all that well received, but I got the idea right away. Sony was drinking Canon's milkshake as photographers and videographers started to really get the idea of mirrorless camera advantages. When they introduced the R, they introduced three different EF to RF adapters. So any old Canon shooter could buy an EOS R, a lens adapter, and pretty much pretend they had a mirrorless Canon EF camera. The key here: you could buy a Sony, buy a Metabones adapter, but you still have a Sony\\u2026 it doesn't work as fast with your EF lenses, it doesn't use your batteries, it doesn't use your speedlights. So Canon was wise: the EOS R's only purpose was to stop the bleeding.  Next thing was glass. The reason Canon and Nikon had 80\\u201390% of the pro SLR and DSLR market for 50 years was that they had huge collections of lenses. As nice as a new camera might be, if you can't get the lens you need, fuggetaboudit! And yet, Canon offered those three adapters\\u2026. no worries.  No worries unless, like Canon, you're trying to launch a new system. Nikon went there\\u2026 Nikon didn't do all that well with the Z system, despite making excellent gear. My contention was simple: you can't make a new system for new users if you're Canon or Nikon. As with the EOS R, you make a camera that's kind of a no-brainer for existing users.  But here's the thing: let's assume I still have my EOS 6D. I go and buy an EOS R, I buy the basic adapter, and I'm golden, right\\u2026 I have a mirrorless Canon EF camera. I'm good, but Canon isn't\\u2026 they'd rather me be an EOS EF user than a Sony user, but what they'd really like is for me to be an EOS R user, cemented in place. That only happens if my next lens buys are RF lenses, not EF lenses, despite the fact they can't work on my other cameras.  So Canon did another cool thing: rather than try to flesh out their RF lens line with the basic set of EF clones they'd need to sell EOS R system cameras, they made hero lenses. The first RF lenses were insanely good lenses. So were the next few. This was brilliant \\u2014 anyone buying that one EOS R body was potentially sucked in for those lenses. This was absolutely an unusual move: Canon was delivering lenses that average folks couldn't afford, but they were selling dreams to their professional user base.   So even without having an R5 in my hands, I know enough about it to know that this completes the circle. This is the pro body that everyone who flirted with EOS R \\u2014 pretty much all pros and well-heeled enthusiasts \\u2014 wanted. And more.  Canon launched the video on a DSLR thing with the Canon 5D Mark II. Okay, sure, Nikon got there a few months before with 720; video, but Canon really sold it. And I think a big part of that, early on, as Vincent Laforet's 5D Mark II short film Reverie\\u2026 anyone who used digital camera for video back then simply knew this film was impossible. But after the 5D Mark II \\u2014 half of which were sold for video use \\u2014 Canon lost steam in the DSLR-for-video market. Why? Well, heck, Canon has been one of the Big Four in camcorders\\u2026 so they built Cinema EOS, a line of much more expensive cinema cameras that used regular EF lenses. And so regular EOS product line cameras had to get the cripple hammer.. you wouldn't want someone buying a $750, $1500, or $3000 camera that fits their needs if maybe you can sell 10% of those buyers on a $10,000+ camera that does it all\\u2026. at least, that seemed to be the logic.   So now the R5 is kind of a return to the 5D Mark II\\u2026 no artificial limitations, far as I can tell. And even IBIS \\u2014 Canon's the last one to the party on that, and I'm a bit skeptical that they can match Olympus on their first try, but I've found it critical for my own shooting.

Let me give you this piece of advice: your camera is the least important thing in your camera bag. Lenses and lighting are far more important, and by far the most important piece of gear is the one between your ears. Invest your money accordingly.  A 5DS r is going for $3,700 new. An EOS R is going for $2000 for just the body. So I'm going to say your total budget is around $4500. A good rule of thumb is to spend 30% of your budget on the body and 70% on lenses. That gives you a budget of around $1350 for a camera body.  As a novice, you just don't need the capabilities of a state of the art camera. I have a 5D mark IV, and honestly 95% of the time any one of my older cameras (5D mark II, 7D, 50D) is going to do the job well enough.  Bottom line is that any pro-grade DSLR made in the last 10 years is going to serve your needs perfectly well. Save your money and buy a used 5D mark III ($900-$1200) or even a 5D mark II ($500\\u2013$800). Some reputable dealers for used equipment are B&H, Adorama, Abe's of Maine, KEH, and 42nd Street Photo.  Pair that body with a good general-purpose zoom lens like the EF 24\\u201370 f/4L IS ($900) to start with. The only other must-have accessories you need with that are a circular polarizing filter (around $100) and good tripod. That is a great kit to get you started learning photography.  Save the rest of your money for now until you reach the creative limits of your initial kit\\u2026 You shouldn't buy anything you don't have a specific need for. You might also seriously consider taking some of the money you save and spending it on some photography classes at your local community college.  What your second lens is going to be depends on the direction you go with your photography. My second lens was the EF 100 f/2.8L macro because I was limited in my ability to do flower pictures by not having a macro lens. My next several purchases were lighting gear. I've bought other pieces of equipment over the years to add new capabilities to allow me to do things I couldn't do with the equipment I had at the time. Avoid the temptation to buy things just because they're new and shiny. Every single piece of gear in your collection should fill a specific need (not a want)."}, {"upvote": 6, "content": "Either one will do fine, but the 50MP picture size of the R5 will slow down your workflow. You don't need that much resolution for wedding photos. Even the 30MP of the 5D mark IV is excessive when you need to process hundreds of photos.  The 24 mp resolution of the R3 combined with its high ISO performance make it very well suited for wedding photography.  But, honestly, you can shoot weddings just fine with 5D mark II."}, {"upvote": 4, "content": "It is undoubtedly an exciting product because of what Canon has claimed. Two most exciting things are:  Pro's:  1. IBIS. 2. 8K video Full Frame! (Exciting)! 3. Canon colour science is brilliant. Now, I will tell you why it may just not be the right camera just yet!  Con's & Not so Con's:  1. Canon, even though one of the oldest player took a lot of time to implement mirrorless and IBIS. 2. Sony on the other hand came in like a storm with their Alpha series when Canon 5D series was ruling the market. 3. What canon did over a decade, Sony was able to pull out magic in just couple of years. 4. Canon has never considered a good 4K slow-mo on their cameras & crop on the sensor when you bump frame rates is such a turnoff. On the other hand Sony has brilliant slow-mo. 5. Also Canon has come up with their new lens range for R Series camera. It will set you back a lot of money as the red rings are amazing but expensive. 6. Canon cameras perform extremely well with Canon glass. But Sony overall does a decent job with third party lens. Undoubtably Canon wins this one. L series lens with Canon body is any day better than Sony glass on Sony body. (Sony is slowly catching up there for sure). 7. DYNAMIC RANGE & LOW LIGHT - I cannot stress enough on these 2 factors. Canon is definitely amazing in these 2 categories. Sony is notches ahead of Canon. A7S2 can literally see in pitch dark situations. (Sorry Canon, but - Sony) Overall Verdict:  I am still a canon shooter and will forever love what Canon did in the initial days. But now the competition is cutthroat and Canon needs to pace up. EOS R5 is one such attempt. But, with Blackmagic providing 6K RAW (with editing solutions out of the box) for 2500$ and all the camera enthusiasts awaiting Sony's A7S3 launch. It might just not be the right time yet to invest in Canon EOS R5. If I were you I would wait for Sony's launch (which I am sure is coming sooner than later) and later decide upon the pick. If Sony disappoints, I would strongly vouch for Blackmagic PCC6K as for the price tag, it is just way too delicious.  P.S: I am still a canon shooter (Canon 5DM4). I am not promoting or degrading any product/company here. I am definitely not paid by any of them (Even though I wish I was).

Alternatively, you can grab a copy of the cross-platform command line tool ExifTool [ http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/ ] and use it to search through the EXIF data.

To use the ExifTool simply string together the Exiftool command pointed at the image file you want to analyze followed by the find command to search through the output and find the string you want.

Thanks for reading"}, {"upvote": 503, "content": "Dear Aspirant  Best wishes for the upcoming EO/AO examination to be conducted by examination. Many aspirants have been asking me about how to go about the preparation strategy. In this answer, I would just be focussing on some broad details without referring any book or any website.  1)Difference between last EO/AO Examination and this time  -Weightage of written marks and interview in the final result in last EO/AO examination was 50:50.  -Weightage of written marks and interview in the final result in this EO/AO examination would be 75:25.  Thus the weightage of written exam has increased a lot. Accordingly, those clearing written examination with good score can make it to final list even with normal interview marks.  2)Cut-off marks  Recruitment Test (100 marks)  UR -49.50  OBC -44.50  SC - 42.50  ST - 43.50  PH(OH)- 30.00  PH(HI)- 33.00  Thus , as you can see the cut off marks were on the lower side indicating that exam was of decent level and not easy.  3) Analysis of last time EO/AO Examination  It is a good practice to go through how the paper was last time regarding its composition and difficulty level. Though it cannot be said that the same would be replicated this time,but it give a fair idea about the exam. It was a 120 questions paper(link of the paper is attached [ https://www.upsc.gov.in/sites/default/files/GENERAL_ABILITY_TEST_EPFO.pdf ]). So let's go through the last time paper in terms of prescribed syllabus:  (i)General English- To evaluate candidate's understanding of English language & workman \\u2013 like use of words.  20 questions were there. The questions asked were  a) Synonym of the word in sentence- Direct synonyms were not asked. Thus focus was on application part rather than just memory. Even if you do not know the exact meaning, you can gauge it from the line  b) Antonym of the word in sentence- Direct antonyms were not asked. Thus focus was on application part rather than just memory. Even if you do not know the exact opposite meaning, you can gauge it from the line.  c) Error in the line- The focus was on application part.  d) Substitute for the Phrase- The focus was on application part.  e) Fill in the blanks- The focus was on application part.  Thus , the focus was more on application part rather than testing the exact knowledge of rules of grammar or comprehension . The same was mentioned in syllabus too. This was a scoring area for candidates with decent English knowledge.  (ii) Indian Freedom Struggle.  15 questions were asked from this part.The questions asked can be categorised difficult. There were no easy pickings here. It even beat the level of questions asked in Civil services examination. Even if a candidate had gone through books like Bipin Chandra or Rajiv Ahir( read for Civil Services), some questions were difficult to answer. Thus it was an area to sail without attracting negative marks( remember negative marking is high at 1/3rd rather than 1/4th as in SSC). Thus one needs to be careful.  (iii) Current Events and Developmental Issues.  7 questions were asked from this part. The questions were relatively easy. Study from any decent source would have provided the answers. Though the weightage was quite low. One can expect more questions from this part.  (iv) Indian Polity  5 questions were asked from this part. The questions were of average level, which is the case with any UPSC paper. Though the weightage was quite low. One can expect more questions from this part.  (v) Indian Economy.  8 questions were asked from this part. 4 of them were core theoretical questions. Someone who has read basic theory of economy would have find these questions as lottery, others might have struggled. Overall average level as with any UPSC paper  (vi) General Accounting Principles.  15 questions were asked from this part. The questions asked were odd in the respect that some of them would have been difficult even for commerce graduates to answer. Understandably, Science/ Arts background students would have find it even more difficult. Overall, can be categorised as difficult. Thus it was an area for Science/ Arts background students to sail without attracting negative marks. The weightage given was high compared to other such exams taken by UPSC.  (vii) Industrial Relations & Labour Laws and Social Security in India.  20 questions were asked from this part. The weightage given was high compared to other such exams taken by UPSC. Almost half of the questions were from Core theoretical base. Then some from Indian context and 2\\u20133 current affair based on Social Security. Overall average level.  (viii) General Science  10 questions were asked from this part. The questions asked were from Core theoretical base rather than current based.Overall average level.  (ix) Knowledge of Computer applications.  5 questions were asked from this part. The questions were very easy. A scoring area for candidates.  (x) General Mental Ability & Quantitative Aptitude.  15 questions were asked from this part. Questions of Time , Speed, distance, profit/loss etc were asked. Not much reasoning was asked. The questions were of average difficulty level. Those who have prepared for Quant for UPSC/SSC/Bank PO would have found them scoring. Those trying to solve them with common sense and not through formula would have taken a lot of time.  Overall Advice  1. Don't rush through basic theories as UPSC has knack of focussing on them. 2. Speed is not much of a factor ( except Quant Part) unlike in exams like SSC. So attempt your exam in a calm manner. 3. Remember there are 120 questions( not 100). In civil services examination conducted by UPSC there are 100 questions, thus some candidates preparing for civil services examination might carry that impression. 4. Try to go through your paper at least 3 times. In first go, only attempt those questions about whom you are at least 90% confident. In second go, attempt those questions about whom you are at least 60% confident. In last go, the rest. You would be amazed that during the third reading you would recall the answers of some of those questions which were unanswerable in first reading. It is the power of subconscious mind. 5. Don't panic if you find paper difficult in first reading. Remember, its a relative exam and not absolute. Difficult exam is difficult for everyone and easy exam is easy for everyone. The one holding his/her nerves in exam hall has a much better chance. 6. Mark you answers after every reading. Do not wait till end to mark your answers. Many candidates do it in a rush in last times only to fill circles wrongly. 7. Give particular attention to what question is asking. like to identify correct or incorrect answer. Many candidates rush through the question and mark wrong answer despite knowing the correct answer. 8. For science/Arts background students, go through accounting related basic concepts from a decent book without going much in detail. Remember , UPSC is not allowing you calculator , thus only broad questions would be asked. 9. For Arts background students, work on your Quant. part. ( Normally, Quant is not their forte). 10. Take care of negative marking as it is 1/3rd. 11. Don't go into examination hall without practising decent number of mock test. It means giving them in almost same conditions you would face in examination hall. All the best"}, {"upvote": 11, "content": "To prepare for any exam you need to know what are the requirements and then see what you need to do to prepare for it.

Weekdays:  5;30 - Quick workout, shower, and breakfast.  6:15 - in the car, on the way to the office or 2\\u20133 days a week, would try to have breakfast with a colleague, mentor, or client. If not meeting someone, on the phone while driving connecting with a colleague, mentor, or client. Especially if you live on the West Coast, or do business internationally - they've already been up and working for hours.  7:00 - In the office, the only quiet time of the day until after 5pm. Attack task list and prep for the meetings of the day.  8:00 - If not already in a meeting, meet with your team, either formally or management by walking around This is your first chance to greet your team, talk to them and surface any challenges. Setting a standing 8am or 8:15am meeting ensures everyone gets in on time and you get to sych and communicate in person.  8:30 -5:30 - Mostly meetings (ideally externally and something that drives growth,or revenue.) The daily mantra is what was my win today. Think about accomplishments not tasks. You might get a few hours to close your office doors and work on the things piling up for you. But this is time better spent with things that can only be done during business hours. Everything else happens after 6pm.  5:30 - Try to finish anything you have to do from the office, and clear your task list. Use this time to skip rush hour traffic. Make a list of seven things you have to do the next day: this forces you to review email and dig deep. Most days, its very easy to put 10 or more things on the list in a few minutes.  6:30 - Leave office. Either meeting a colleague, mentor, client, and/or wife for dinner, or on the phone on the way home. Maybe an audio book.  7:30 - Unwind, some family time. If it's Friday, the day ends here. Else:  9:00pm - On couch with wife and laptop, watching a movie, finishing open tasks, review calendar the next day, plan the day and next days going forward. Crucial to getting a good nights sleep. Try to be in bed by 10pm. Some nights stretch until midnight or later.  Saturday morning: Up early, usually 6am. Try to finish up any tasks left from the week before the family wakes up, usually 8am-9am. Catch up on business reading (Fortune, Forbes, BusinessWeek, HBR). Spend rest of the day trying to spend as much quality time with the family.  Sunday evening: After 7pm, planning for the next week. Reviewing schedule, tasks, team goals, quarterly goals, budget, etc.  As an entrepreneur, you don't get to pick the problems you work on. The buck literally stops with you, and things have to get done. You also have to kick your own but every day. There's an old adage: Drive your business, or your business will drive thee.

A 50mm lens is of course a normal lens on a full frame camera, a reasonable portrait lens on an APS-C camera. The fast, wise aperture makes this lens good for low light. The difference between f/1.8 and f/1.4 is only 2/3 of a f-stop... useful but not profound. You get a bit shallower depth of field, a bit faster shutter speed or lower ISO, but nothing game-changing.  There is a tradition among film camera companies to offer the nifty-fifty, a really cheap 50mm f/1.8 lens. But here's the thing: these are cheap only in construction. The image quality is usually top-notch. I used to own the 50mm f/1.4 for my Canon full frame 6D, which was about 3.5x more expensive. For that, you got a better mechanical build, quieter focusing motor, and yeah, an extra 2/3 stop. By by the time you're stopped down at f/2.0 or so on either lens, there was no significant difference.  Today, my main system is Micro Four Thirds. The first thing I did in that system was buy prime lenses: 20mm f/1.7, 25mm f/1.8, 45mm f/1.8, 17mm f/1.8, and 75mm f/1.8 \\u2026 over the course of several years. The faster lenses basically put my m43 system where my full frame was with the 24\\u2013105mm f4.0L zoom, far as light goes. Probably a bit sharper, too. Today I have a few fast zooms, and a manual 25mm f/0.95 for those really low light situations.  Shooting with primes vs. zooms is a personal choice. It's not for everyone and not for every situation. If just starting out, I'd get the 50mm f/1.8, just because these are sold at can't-say-no prices. I own an Olympus 30mm f/3.5 macro lens for much the same reason: at $99, I could literally not say no. Go from there. Learn that lens, see how it affects your photography. Moving from a zoom to a prime can be good for you, creatively. You have to think through a shot a bit more, maybe move your feet a bit to a different location, etc. You get to play with depth of field in ways not available with the usual f/3.5-f/5.6 kit lens.

Why? Who sez? What's wrong with full-length portraits? What about portraits showing the surroundings, environment, establishing place?  I do think the classical headshot shouldn't be done with a wide-angle, but I also think the classical headshot ought not to be done with a normal focal length. It's entirely a perspective thing. The closer your subject is to your lens, the less flattering the perspective. It's why so many arms-length selfies look bad; the nose is much closer to the lens than the ears, so there is a very noticeable perspective distortion as the ears look twice as far away. It's the reason for the invention of the hated selfie stick. Headshots are best made with greater camera-to-subject distance, which is why most portrait focal lengths are around double the normal, whatever it is (and that is determined by the diagonal of the sensor). See Paul Moshay's answer to Can you shoot quality portraits with a wide-angle lens, Canon 24mm? [ https://www.quora.com/Can-you-shoot-quality-portraits-with-a-wide-angle-lens-Canon-24mm/answer/Paul-Moshay-1 ]  One of the best executive portraits I've seen is a classic, with the exec in or near the center of the frame, leaning perhaps on a highly polished conference table and reflected in it, maybe with a window with a skyline view behind her. It's frankly been done so often it's starting to be cliche, but it works like mad. I've done it often. But using a wide-angle for portraiture is difficult; you really need to pay attention, keep the camera level, usually keep your subject(s) nearer the center of the frame to evade any barrel distortion, and very generally keep your distance; don't try making a head-and-shoulders with a wide-angle unless the look is what you want."}, {"upvote": 13, "content": "Nope. In fact, pretty much across the board, they're better.  Why? Well, that's actually a good question. For the most part, Canon has been designing very high quality lenses for RF: pro grade, using the latest lens technology, which also has the tendency to make them expensive, heavy, and large. That goes with the territory.  The how is easy. The EOS EF line goes back to the days before digital, to the days before modern lens design CAD, etc. And that also means the days before an effective 20 megapixels, for the most part, much less 50 megapixels. In fact, when Canon put out the 50 megapixel EOS 5DS, they also published a list of recommended lenses. I was a Canon shooter, I even had a couple on that list, one or two that weren't even L-series. On the other hand, there were plenty of L-series lenses that did not make that list.  So the RF lenses are being designed, probably not just for the eventual 40\\u201350 megapixel camera that Canon will certaily release (probably the soon-to-be-announced EOS R5), but the ones that go even higher resolution after that. The full frame market in particular is pretty obsessed with sharpness these days\\u2026 which has its merits, but isn't always idea. And you pay for it. The RF mount was Canon's first clean slate since 1987, and they've been taking it on largely with all new designs, not just dropping an extra 24mm on the back of an EF lens and calling it RF.  I was kind of surpised when the first four or so RF lenses were basically all hero lenses. But I got it, eventually. For one, lens design has long been Canon's superpower, and they were probably trying to remind the industry, including those considering leaving Canon for Sony, about this fact. Sony's certainly upped their game on in-house lens design, but for most of their existence they've counted on Zeiss to deliver the goods.  Then you had to look at the R-series camera introductions, which I didn't get at first. Canon put out the R, which was essentially well priced mirrorless 5DIV, but nothing all that amazing. Then the RP, a too-small discount full frame, clearly intended to compete with the fact that Sony was selling full frames as low as $1,000 with lens. But you had to understand that, with only four lenses or so, Canon wasn't going to bring in new users to the R system\\u2026 but they were making it easy for existing EOS users to grab an R body and play with mirrorless at much lower price point, since all your EF lenses fit, you batteries fit, your speedlights, etc.  So say I'm a pro that grabbed an EOS R and an adapter. I now effectively have a new EF body\\u2026 and maybe I'm done.

Having used both I don't see much of the difference other than the continuous shooting speed where the 200D shoots at 5fps and 800D at 6fps. The body weight for 800D is 532g and 200D is a little light weighted camera weighing 453g. Going deeper into the cons and pros it can be differentiated this way.  1. Battery 800D- 600 shots per charge  200D- 650 shots per charge.  I don't find this as a proper con because it hardly matters.  2. Focus Points  800D- 45  200D- 9  This is a good reason to choose 800D over 200D. The more the focus points the better it is as you'll have more points to focus on your subject and you can decide the focal point where the subject is in sharp focus and the rest is blurred away.  3. 800D has Digital Video Stabilization which helps to stable the footage shot with the inbuilt mechanism.  4. Both have the same Aps-C sensor with the same mm sensor and the pixels for both are same which is 24mp.  If it's that you're looking for a camera which shoots good videos I would suggest you check out the options in sony dslr's. However, the lenses and body is expensive as compared to canon. For beginners canon would do as it has variety over lenses and body is comparatively cheaper. Will do the work for you. 800D is great for the range and work you're looking for.

And I think they made some good decisions, and a few bad ones that may have not been choices as much as technical limitations.  Neither Canon nor Nikon were actually new to mirrorless with last August's introductions. But the R and the Z are professional formats, even if the first models are not a match for the top-of-the-line DSLRs yet. Both Canon and Nikon took on the idea that mirrorless was something less than DSLR, a step between DSLR and compact digital cameras (aka point and shoot). Nikon's 1 system used the same 1\\u2033 sensor size found in high-end P&S cameras like the Sony RX10 and RX100. But Canon put out a very compact APS-C system with their EOS M. And a funny thing happened: while Nikon's 1 system is now defunct, the EOS M is very popular, albeit not necessarily in the USA. Canon's been the #2 mirrorless brand in Japan in 2016 and 2017 (BCN rankings, second to Olympus) and looks to be taking the #1 spot for the 2018 year\\u2026 without even counting the EOS R. Canon seems to have nailed the consumer mirrorless ILC with the EOS M.  So it should be no surprise that Canon got into mirrorless on a higher level with the EOS R, but then again, it should be. Canon is slower to react to competition than just about anyone. Why this, why now? Canon feels the competition.  For most of history since maybe the 1940s or 1950s, Canon and Nikon had much of the professional market for cameras. In the 1960s, led by Nikon, they won an 80% share, and it's been pretty much 80\\u201390% ever since. Canon managed to flip the market share on Nikon by being the first to court consumers, and then by delivering the fastest speeds for pro sports shooters. But for a long time, the only 35mm, then full-frame choice for most pros was Nikon or Canon.  This last year, the whole industry sold only 11.6 million ILCs, less than half of those sold in 2013. And 2017 was actually an 8% increase from 2016. But more the point, DSLRs sold only accounted for 65% of the ILC market\\u2026 clearly, Nikon and Canon were no longer winning an 80\\u201390% share. And while Canon's mirrorless sales were up 70% in 2017, Nikon wasn't even part of that. And of course, neither was competitive with Sony, Olympus, Panasonic, or Fujifilm in higher-end mirrorless. No one knows just where the DSLR vs. mirrorless ratio settles out in the long term, but it's not going to be terribly favorable to any company only making DSLRs.  What's It For?  If you look carefully at the EOS R, like the Nikon Z's, you'll know just what it's for: the EOS R is a mirrorless body for Canon users to buy, so that they don't buy Sonys. This is the big factor. Canon users have been trying Sony A7s with adapters, and liking them. Some keep it as an accessory, but some sell their Canon gear and move to Sony. Canon needs that to stop, and their first reaction to this situation is the EOS R.  Canon's introducing one body and four lenses, two of them quite expensive, but still, that's not a full system for nearly anyone who needs a system camera. It's a start. But if you're already a Canon shooter, the R is with an adapter is going to let you try out mirrorless with all of your glass \\u2014 even EF-S lenses, but EF-M lenses are impossible \\u2014 your existing batteries and flash units, etc. It's a much simpler way to experiment with mirrorless for today's Canon shooter. If you're new to ILCs and want full-frame mirrorless, EOS R won't be a great option for at least 3\\u20135 years, depending on how quickly Canon rolls out new glass.  So you're supposed to compare the EOS R to a Sony A7 Mark III, but the closest match is actually the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV. So you're getting more or less a mirrorless 5D Mark IV with some improvements/extra features for $900 less. That's a pretty fine deal, speaking from the Canon universe. It's a bit more expensive than the A7 Mark III, but no one's more aggressive on body pricing than Sony.  I think it succeeds in its mission. If I still had my Canon system and was ready for full frame mirrorless, the EOS R is a no-brainer versus the Sony. It's not even the cost of the bodies or the minute details of the features, but the fact it's already part of my system. The cheap lens adapter is only $100, and it works perfectly. For a bit more, I could get the adapter with filter holder, simply brilliant for video work.  Video Issues  Alas, on that latter one, Canon's still being Canon, and not in a good way. They're still crippling 4K video on the EOS R, delivering the same 1.7x crop you have on the EOS 5D mark IV. If you're buying a full-frame DSLR for video, the point is to have full frame video. With that crop, you're better off going to a Panasonic GH5 or a Blackmagic Design Pocket Cinema Camera 4K, depending on your needs.  I expect for most stills work, you have a 5D Mark IV as far as the quality goes. You won't quite match Sony in very low light, but you'll have a bit more resolution in bright light, so it's probably not a big deal for most photographers. You'll have the Canon color, which Sony has yet to match, and the Canon menus you're used to\\u2026 well, maybe. They have a few new controls on the camera, which changes around the way its used. There's a programmable ring control on lenses, but you won't run into that with adapted EF lenses unless you get the third adapter, the one with the ring control. There's also a touch strip on the back, which most reviewers aren't yet crazy about.  Neither Sony nor Canon has 10-bit in-camera video, which is what you need for serious Log shooting. But the EOS R does have that as an external option, at least. I'd bet on Sony's A7S Mark III offering 10-bit in some fashion, but like Canon, Sony's got their own cinema camera business they feel compelled to protect by crippling the mirrorless models. Oddly, though, Nikon opted for the same thing, in-camera 8-bit, external 10-bit, even without a video market to protect. I guess that leaves them both with a feature to add to a higher end model, next year. Or save money and buy the GH5 right now.  Conclusions  So basically, I think the EOS R is attractive to anyone with a full Canon system thinking about mirrorless. If Canon's annoying behaviors haven't driven you away yet, this may well be your mirrorless. I don't really find any huge problems with it. Knowing that Sony was the initial target, nothing about the EOS R or the Nikon Zs were particularly unexpected. Both aim for the Sony's, Nikon at both the A7III and the A7RIII, Canon's basically doing the A7III competitor now. I would hope they're holding off an A7RIII competitor until they have some improved sensor tech, probably also going into the EOS 5DS Mark II."}, {"upvote": 21, "content": "The EOS 1D X is pretty much overkill\\u2026 this is kind of an odd list, with over a 12:1 price range. Not only is the 1D X around $6,000 (body-only), but you're going to need expensive CFast cards for 4K video, and the 4K video on the thing is in gigantic Motion JPEG files, and not all that amazing anyway. If I wanted a 4K camera for video, I'd recommend either get a Panasonic GH4 or perhaps a Sony A7s mark II.  The Nikon D80 (2006) and the D3 (2007) are ancient models and don't shoot video. The D3s does shoot video, but only 720p, not full HD.  The EOS 7D (2009) is also fairly old. It can shoot 720p or 1080p video, but only 12 minutes at a time. The others here can shoot 29\\u203259\\u2033 without stopping \\u2014 that's a limit set to avoid paying a European camcorder tax. While it doesn't apply at all in the USA, most camera manufacturers (other than Panasonic, far as I know) impose this limit even on North American and Japanese models.  The Nikon D5300 isn't a bad choice for video. It's a few models old, it came out in 2003, the current model is the D5600, so it's may be available for a value price. But this line is a consumer line, APS-C sensor, and not terribly expensive. It can shoot video at 1080p up to 60fps\\u2026 not something you'd need for vlogging, but you want 60p for sports or other action video. Another advantage for vlogging, the D5300 has built-in WiFi, so it can be controlled wirelessly via an app. Most Canon and Nikon can be tethered via USB for remote control, and some have add-on controls, but it's handy to have it built-in.  I have the EOS 6D, and it produces amazing video, particularly in low light, where it blows away my far more expensive dedicated camcorders. The 6D right now is a good bargain, but mostly because everyone expects Canon to announce the 6D mark II Real Soon Now. The 6D also has built-in WiFi.  The EOS 5D mark III is the upgrade of Canon's breakthrough EOS 5D mark II. It's a great camera, one of the go-to standards for video-on-stills camera shooting. But while it's a solid choice if you can afford it, it's not the best choice. For one, it's been superceeded by the EOS 5D mark IV, if you're looking for a higher end model that shoots great video.  Of those on your list, the Canon EOS 80D would be my choice for anyone wanting a strong video option. Like the Nikon, it can shoot a variety of modes up to 1080p60. But the real advantage is in the sensor. This is Canon's second-generation mid-range DSLR with what they call a Dual Pixel sensor. This sensor splits each pixel into two separate photodiodes. Based on the way they're masked, each sensor pair works like a phase-detect autofocus sensor. So unlike every other DSLR on your list, the 80D can give you full performance autofocus in video, and things you usually just find on camcorders and mirrorless cameras, like follow-focus in video, etc. Dual Pixel is also used on Canon's 5D mark IV and all the new Cinema EOS video cameras. And the 80D also has built-in WiFi.  Far as the larger idea of a full camera system goes, you can't really go wrong with either Canon or Nikon. They have the two most complete lines of cameras and two most complete collection of lenses. However, neither offers a mirrorless option. So that means you're only shooting video from the back screen, not the viewfinder. And that only the 80D on your list has fully function video autofocus\\u2026 the others will AF in video, but it's on demand, not continuous, and it's often not very good. The phase detect sensors that DSLRs use are not available with the mirror up, which is what you have in video mode.  For one-person vlogging, keep in mind you are going to want to see yourself, which means either an add-on monitor while shooting or an articulated screen. The 80D and the D5300 both have fully articulated screens which let you see what you're recording from the front of the camera. The others do not, and will absolutely require an external monitor for vlogging."}, {"upvote": 2, "content": "TLDR: There is no best lens, just a lot of different tools.  It's like asking what the seasoning/spices are best for chicken. There are obviously some staples\\u2026 but it really depends on what you plan to make.  The 18\\u201355 kits or 18\\u2013135 lens is usually your starting point. The key point is startg out and look for your voice and vision with these lenses. It's important to understand how camera to subject distance greatly affects the perspective/composition. A lot of people just look at something they want to take a photo, they stick the camera in their face, zoom the lens to get the framing they want\\u2026 and then press the shutter button. Better photographers will think a bit about what perspective they want\\u2026 walk over the spot and angle that they want and then use a focal length (aka zoom) to give them the frame coverage they want. For taking portraits of people\\u2026 this tends to be about 9\\u201315 feet (3\\u20135m). Too close and their face looks distorted. Here is a set of photos, the first number is the focal length (aka what some people think of as the the zoom), the second number is the distance between the camera and the subject.  Here is a video that goes into the effect in more depth, one of the key takeaways is that you will notice that the proportions between the subject and background change. You can use this this as an artistic tool to tell your story in your images.  https://youtu.be/_TTXY1Se0eg The other thing you are going to here a lot is bokeh that term is used incorrectly a lot, but what is talking about is blurring out the background to a shallow depth of field in order to give separation of the subject from the background for artistic emphasis of the subject (depth of field is the how deep is the area where objects are in focus, a shallow depth of field means only a few things that are near each other in distance are in focus, but things closer or farther from the focus subject will be blurred. A large depth of field means a lot of the scene is in focus). A lot of people will talk about getting the 50mm f1.8 which on 200D offers a cheap, easy way to creating images with a shallow depth of field (it's half decent as an affordable portrait lens). It's not a bad option, but again remember it is just a tool. Too many novices over-use, over-emphasize it like adding hot sauce to everything they eat.  The first three lenses I suggested are very affordable and will help you learn the basic of composition, perspective, and depth of field in order to express yourself in photos. As you get a better idea on what type of image you like to make, you will have a better idea of what lenses you should buy. It should be noted that you should often be able to cheaply rent lenses for a weekend to try out before buy them. Here is a guide I found with one perspective.  The First Canon Lenses You Should Buy [ https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-first-canon-lenses-you-should-buy/ ]  Personally, I like the 17\\u201355 F2.8 and say the 70\\u2013200 F4, but that is my personal preference and your may differ (in particular I'm not a huge fan of ultrawide angle\\u2026 so I personally wouldn't get something like the 10\\u201318mm, but a lot of other people do).

Let me give you this piece of advice: your camera is the least important thing in your camera bag. Lenses and lighting are far more important, and by far the most important piece of gear is the one between your ears. Invest your money accordingly.  A 5DS r is going for $3,700 new. An EOS R is going for $2000 for just the body. So I'm going to say your total budget is around $4500. A good rule of thumb is to spend 30% of your budget on the body and 70% on lenses. That gives you a budget of around $1350 for a camera body.  As a novice, you just don't need the capabilities of a state of the art camera. I have a 5D mark IV, and honestly 95% of the time any one of my older cameras (5D mark II, 7D, 50D) is going to do the job well enough.

The 5Ds is, in part, designed to be an affordable alternative to medium format cameras and backs, so anyplace you would use a medium format camera you would want at least that resolution.   In a more general sense, the greater the resolution the more options you have for editing an image and making it look really great.  I always want a bigger image, even if I know that 99% of the time I am not going to be selling prints larger than 10x13.  Doing retouching for individual portraits, weddings, seniors, etc., looks more natural if you can edit a large image and then resize it for output, even if the output is 8x10 or 5x7.  If I am doing masks with any level of intricacy my job is made exponentially easier if I have a large image to work with.   Honestly, as a professional, I cannot imagine not wanting that resolution.  The only thing it hurts is my wallet buying more external hard drives and computer upgrades, and the number of options that are opened up for creating high quality (ie. Better than my competition) images is fantastic.   Lastly, the word \\\"necessary\\\" is often very subjective.  Some of my favorite fine art photographers composite low resolution images for fantastic effect, and would not even \\\"need\\\" the resolution of a Canon 10D or a 5 year old Rebel.  Higher resolution does not, of course, always = a great final product, but for many of us it gives us a better starting point, everything else being equal."}, {"upvote": 16, "content": "If you are getting grainy photos out of an EOS R - a top-of-the-line mirrorless camera - the only explanation is operator error.  Some possible causes of graininess:   * Shooting at too high an ISO and/or no noise reduction. The higher the ISO the higher the noise.  * Setting camera to shoot in low-quality JPG or SRAW mode versus full resolution RAW files  * Image artifacts caused by excessive sharpening or noise reduction  * Underexposed images that are being corrected with software (EG over-reliance on the Auto-lighting optimizer setting versus using fill light) Other causes for low image quality:   * Shooting at too low of a shutter speed with a unstabilized lens. Without IS, your lowest hand-held shutter speed is approximately the reciprocal of the focal length, e.g. 1/100 with a 100mm lens. With 4 stops of IS, your minimum shutter speed would be 1/7 sec. IS eliminates blurring due to camera motion but not due to subject motion.  * Using a low-quality lens with insufficient resolving power for the sensor  * Bad post-processing technique You would have to provide a sample image and full EXIF information in order to identify the cause."}, {"upvote": 2, "content": "If you are serving a major wire-service covering major league sports, it is one of the two major tools of the trade. It is a massive camera, which balances super-telephotos very well. It shoots 20MP images that transmit quickly as JPEGs. The range of ISO settings is extreme. It offers 16\\u201320 frames per second depending upon configuration. It finds fans in wildlife photography as well as sports.  Is it the camera that can turn a beginner into a pro? Far from it. For a 20MP camera, it is extremely expensive. It is narrowly designed for action photography, a specialty that demands great skill and experience. As a day-to-day camera, it is relatively low resolution and extremely bulky and heavy. Part of being a pro is to be a beast of burden. Unless you are being well paid, it is not a camera to carry for pleasure.  It is weather-proof and may go 500,000 exposures before the first maintenance. Few professionals and way fewer enthusiasts will ever shoot 500k exposures. Bringing it back to like-new standards is affordable, but the result is an ancient camera, lacking all the new technology and features.  If you are currently shooting for a major sports publication or an agency that deals in sports photography, see if they can score one for you. If you are an enthusiast looking for an exceptional camera body, realize that a working photographer will put up with a whole lot that an amateur would not. For most enthusiastic photographers, it would be a horrible choice."}, {"upvote": 21, "content": "The EOS 1D X is pretty much overkill\\u2026 this is kind of an odd list, with over a 12:1 price range. Not only is the 1D X around $6,000 (body-only), but you're going to need expensive CFast cards for 4K video, and the 4K video on the thing is in gigantic Motion JPEG files, and not all that amazing anyway. If I wanted a 4K camera for video, I'd recommend either get a Panasonic GH4 or perhaps a Sony A7s mark II.  The Nikon D80 (2006) and the D3 (2007) are ancient models and don't shoot video. The D3s does shoot video, but only 720p, not full HD.  The EOS 7D (2009) is also fairly old. It can shoot 720p or 1080p video, but only 12 minutes at a time. The others here can shoot 29\\u203259\\u2033 without stopping \\u2014 that's a limit set to avoid paying a European camcorder tax. While it doesn't apply at all in the USA, most camera manufacturers (other than Panasonic, far as I know) impose this limit even on North American and Japanese models.  The Nikon D5300 isn't a bad choice for video. It's a few models old, it came out in 2003, the current model is the D5600, so it's may be available for a value price. But this line is a consumer line, APS-C sensor, and not terribly expensive. It can shoot video at 1080p up to 60fps\\u2026 not something you'd need for vlogging, but you want 60p for sports or other action video. Another advantage for vlogging, the D5300 has built-in WiFi, so it can be controlled wirelessly via an app. Most Canon and Nikon can be tethered via USB for remote control, and some have add-on controls, but it's handy to have it built-in.  I have the EOS 6D, and it produces amazing video, particularly in low light, where it blows away my far more expensive dedicated camcorders. The 6D right now is a good bargain, but mostly because everyone expects Canon to announce the 6D mark II Real Soon Now. The 6D also has built-in WiFi.  The EOS 5D mark III is the upgrade of Canon's breakthrough EOS 5D mark II. It's a great camera, one of the go-to standards for video-on-stills camera shooting. But while it's a solid choice if you can afford it, it's not the best choice. For one, it's been superceeded by the EOS 5D mark IV, if you're looking for a higher end model that shoots great video.  Of those on your list, the Canon EOS 80D would be my choice for anyone wanting a strong video option. Like the Nikon, it can shoot a variety of modes up to 1080p60. But the real advantage is in the sensor. This is Canon's second-generation mid-range DSLR with what they call a Dual Pixel sensor. This sensor splits each pixel into two separate photodiodes. Based on the way they're masked, each sensor pair works like a phase-detect autofocus sensor. So unlike every other DSLR on your list, the 80D can give you full performance autofocus in video, and things you usually just find on camcorders and mirrorless cameras, like follow-focus in video, etc. Dual Pixel is also used on Canon's 5D mark IV and all the new Cinema EOS video cameras. And the 80D also has built-in WiFi.  Far as the larger idea of a full camera system goes, you can't really go wrong with either Canon or Nikon. They have the two most complete lines of cameras and two most complete collection of lenses. However, neither offers a mirrorless option. So that means you're only shooting video from the back screen, not the viewfinder. And that only the 80D on your list has fully function video autofocus\\u2026 the others will AF in video, but it's on demand, not continuous, and it's often not very good. The phase detect sensors that DSLRs use are not available with the mirror up, which is what you have in video mode.  For one-person vlogging, keep in mind you are going to want to see yourself, which means either an add-on monitor while shooting or an articulated screen. The 80D and the D5300 both have fully articulated screens which let you see what you're recording from the front of the camera. The others do not, and will absolutely require an external monitor for vlogging."}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Canon-Eos-750D-sufficient-for-beginner%E2%80%99s-photography", "question": "Is the Canon Eos 750D sufficient for beginner%E2%80%99s photography", "answers": [{"upvote": 2, "content": "Some cameras are packed with attention-grabbing features, but I think the average SLR owner would prefer to be dazzled by the quality of their photos than by the camera itself. That seems to be the thinking behind Canon's mid-price consumer SLRs, of which the EOS 750D is the probably Canon's best example. The more recent model \\u2013 the Canon EOS 760D \\u2013 doesn't quite offer enough to justify its extra price premium.  In fact, the Canon EOS 750D is very much in the mould of its predecessor, the Canon 700D, in that it doesn't have anything that blows the competition away; rather it's the consistent, all-round high quality that makes this our top choice for budding enthusiasts.  The 750D arrives two years later than the 700D, and while there's little to separate them from the outside, there are some significant changes inside. The autofocus sensor has been upgraded, up from 9 to 19 points, all of which are cross-type for increased sensitivity. It appears to be the same autofocus sensor used in the the Canon 70D and the the Canon 7D before that. It's still short of the 39 points offered by the Nikon D5500, though, and its diamond-shaped array of points covers a smaller area in the centre of the frame.  The imaging sensor is new, too, with a 24-megapixel resolution to match chief rivals, the Nikon D5500 and Nikon D5600. There's also a new metering sensor that measures the brightness of the scene at 7,560 points, which is a significant step up over the EOS 700D's 63-zone metering.  Continuous shooting performance is a match for the 700D and D5500 at 5fps, with a modest amount of buffer memory that maintains this speed for seven RAW frames before it slows to the speed of whatever SD card you have inserted in its SD card slot. Battery life is rated at 440 shots, though, far short of the D5500's 820 shots and the viewfinder has regressed slightly, going from a 0.85x to a 0.82x magnification. That equates to 0.51x magnification on a full-frame camera, which makes it one of the smallest viewfinders currently offered by an interchangeable-lens camera. Only Canon's low-end EOS1300D has a smaller magnification viewfinder at 0.8x.  The new metering and autofocus systems conspire to deliver subject tracking autofocus \\u2013 something the 700D offered in live view mode but not when using the viewfinder. We weren't overly impressed with it on that model, though. We saw some evidence of it working but not enough to convince us to rely on it.  The 750D's subject tracking is far more responsive and accurate in live view mode, although it seemed to need to wait for the subject to stop moving before focusing on it. Enabling live view also meant we were able to position the static autofocus point freely in any part of the frame. At a time when consumer SLRs are under threat from increasingly sophisticated compact system cameras (CSCs) it's ironic, but perhaps inevitable, that the Canon EOS 750D's live view mode is beginning to overtake its viewfinder-based operation.  The 750D is still faster for shot-to-shot times when using the viewfinder. We measured 0.4 seconds, compared to around one second in live view mode. This live view performance is a big improvement on the 700D, though, which took over four seconds between shots.  Controls, Wi-Fi and video  There are a couple of new buttons on the top plate. DISP switches the LCD screen on and off. An autofocus mode button cycles through the single-point, zone and auto modes and lets the user adjust the autofocus point. It's a surprising addition seeing as there's already a button on the back for this, although the new one is better in that it cycles around the three modes with repeated presses. The selected autofocus point can be moved using the touchscreen while looking through the viewfinder. This proved to be quicker than using the four-way navigation buttons.  As before, there are dedicated buttons for drive mode, ISO speed, exposure compensation, white balance, autofocus mode, AE lock, Picture Style preset and depth-of-field preview, plus a Q Menu for additional settings such as JPEG/RAW quality and metering mode. The touchscreen makes this Q Menu a breeze to navigate.  Wi-Fi makes an appearance. It uses a different app to previous Canon SLRs and compacts, but once again we had difficulty getting it to work with our Nexus 4 phone. NFC is there to simplify configuration but the reality was anything but simple. Each time it failed it generated a new encryption password, which made troubleshooting pretty exasperating.  We had more joy with the iOS app. It connected first time and gave us responsive full-screen previews of the photos stored in the camera. It's also possible to apply star ratings to photos but not to sort them by rating. A remote viewfinder mode is included too, with the ability to move the autofocus point and adjust exposure controls.  The app doesn't support video capture or playback, but in other respects the video mode is well specified. 1080p clips are encoded in AVC format at 24, 25 or 30fps with a choice of automatic or manual exposure. There's a socket for an external microphone but no headphone socket to monitor it with. We've often complained about coarse details in videos from Canon's consumer SLRs. The 750D was a little better than the 700D in this respect but it still fell short of the standards set by Nikon SLRs. Moir\\u00e9 remains a problem in videos, with multi-coloured swirls of interference over dense, repeating patterns.  The 750D beat Nikon SLRs hands down for video autofocus, though. When paired with an STM lens (including the 18-55mm kit lens), focusing was responsive, smooth and virtually silent. The touchscreen made it easy to adjust the autofocus point while recording. For most people, this will be far more appealing than the Nikon's crisper video details.  Image quality  The EOS 700D lagged behind the D5500 for image quality so it's good to see some improvement this time around. The increased resolution from 18 to 24 megapixels has given a small but welcome boost to detail levels, and puts it on a level pegging with the D5500. Noise levels are lower too, with an appreciable reduction in chroma noise in the shadows of photos at ISO 800 and above. There wasn't much to separate the EOS 750D and Nikon D5500 for noise but the 750D's JPEGs retained slightly more fine detail at ISO 3200 and above.  The kit lens put in a decent performance with good corner sharpness, but we noticed a few instances where the camera had front focused, leaving the main subject looking slightly soft. This is a problem we've seen many times before on consumer SLRs, but never from their live view modes, or from CSCs.  Canon 750D and conclusion  The 750D isn't the only new addition to the EOS range. The Canon 760D arrived at the same time and is very similar except for its dual dials, passive LCD screen to show settings and an eye-level sensor so the LCD screen switches off automatically when the viewfinder is used. It's also able to shoot in live view mode with continuous autofocus. It's available body-only for around \\u00a3580, making it around \\u00a3120 more expensive than the EOS 750D.  I'd be more tempted with the Canon 70D, which ups the stakes yet again with a significantly larger viewfinder, various additional buttons, 7fps shooting, a bigger battery and weather-sealed construction. It's currently available for \\u00a3585 body only. Meanwhile, the 700D remains on sale for \\u00a3500 with the 18-55mm lens.  The fact that we'd struggle to choose between the 700D, 750D and 70D at current prices suggests that Canon has pitched this new family member well. We prefer it to the Nikon D5500 and the fact that it performs so well in live view mode means it can hold its own among CSCs too."}, {"upvote": 2, "content": "Some classify the DSLR cameras in three cathegories, the cameras for the beginner, the cameras for the serious amateur (prosumer?) and the cameras for the professional photographer.

It has all the buttons and controls you want from a DSLR, and a lot of controls aimed to the amateur and beginner photographer.  As it accepts the EF and EF-S lenses, it can be used as the first step in serious photography with specialized or expensive lenses, or the camera for the amateur that never buy another lens and stays with the fine kit lenses (18\\u201355mm or 18\\u2013135mm, you choose).

Its a touch better than the 700D, which a YouTuber considered as the best and cheapest video camera. Good choice!  The best lens? Here's my humble recommendations:  1. The kit lens, EFS 18\\u201355mm F3.5\\u20135.6 IS STM. You're good to go! Since the 750D is a cropped body, you're real focal length would become 28\\u201388mm! You can do wide shots (at 28mm), portraits, landscapes (at F8 or F16), or videos. 2. The Sigma 18\\u201335mm F1.8 (The effective focal length is the lens' mm times 1.6 crop factor, do the math my friend.) Now this time, this lens has the sharpness of a prime lens and the convenience of a zoom lens, at fixed F1.8 aperture! More blurry background, better bokeh, (I can't say enough, its fantastic.) The price is great too! 3. Canon 10\\u201318mm F4.5\\u20135.6. For real wide shots, this is acceptable. It will make your 750D like a full-frame camera with a wider angle of view. (Not really like a full-frame, but at least). Go buy one and you can shoot a photo of your bedroom while being inside. Capture it all. 4. Canon 70\\u2013200mm. This is a telephoto lens. For real long distance shots. 5. One Macro lens. Any lens that says Macro would do. In answering the question, I thought of the price. All these lenses are fairly cheap. Though the Sigma is quite dollar-hungry."}, {"upvote": 5, "content": "I know a lot of photographers may not like Ken Rockwell, but I like to use one of his quotes for this. \\\"If you ever have to ask the question, you probably don't need it\\\".

Do not get this line of thinking stuck in your head because it's not entirely true. In fact, to be honest, this statement is used many times by people who simply can't afford good gear and are jealous at those who can. If you can't afford good gear right now, that's fine; work with what you can afford and save up money to grow into better gear over time. The best camera is always the one you have with you and by this I mean, if you own a $6,500 Canon 1DX and it's sitting at home, your best camera may be the free one that came built into the phone in your pocket!  While it is true, skill is the most important aspect of almost anything, including photography, your gear and even more specifically, your lenses, are just as important. A good lens on an inexpensive camera is always better than a cheap lens on an expensive camera. If you're just starting out and looking for a camera for a beginner, try to think about what sort of photography you'll be doing. General photography such as family photos, photos of your friends, pets, etc.; landscape photography; wildlife photography; street photography, etc. If you don't know yet, that's okay but if you have a goal of developing skills specific to one of these styles, it will help with camera selection.  When getting started, I'd get something inexpensive but not so cheap that your photo quality ends up discouraging you altogether (again, this is where the \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" nonsense kicks in.) I'll cover a couple types and why they're good starter cameras. And with any camera you choose, always try to keep the camera out of \\\"automatic mode\\\" if possible so you begin to master the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  Point-and-Shoot or Camera Phone  These cameras are very inexpensive and with the newer smartphones, the camera is built right in and often takes better photos than the DSLR's from just a few years ago! This is the most inexpensive route to take (and may not cost a penny if you use the camera on your phone) and it helps you learn about composition, lighting, etc. If you're already past this point and want a camera you can grow into, the following are good options:  Traditional SLR's  I know, this is probably not what most people think of when deciding on a beginner's camera but I want to mention it because if you have one of these lying around in your house (parent's or grandparent's old camera, etc.), they're great for learning the basics of a camera with all of the digital stuff removed. SLR (single lens reflex) cameras aren't used much anymore because of the cost of operation, decreased photo quality, and lack of film processing labs, however, I think any aspiring photographer should own or at least use one because they are the \\\"original camera\\\", they are inexpensive, and they help give you a greater appreciation for the luxury of digital photography (not limited to 24-36 photos per roll, immediate results where you can see your photo seconds after taking it, easy and fast multiple frame shooting, and no cost by ruining a roll of film or wasting it on bad photos.) If you buy a traditional SLR 35mm camera, I'd go for something like the Nikon 35mm F2AS with a 50mm \\\"prime lens\\\", or similar. Here's a photo of one of mine:  Digital SLR's  Digital SLR's, or DSLR's, have been the most popular choice for many years now, they're easy to find used, and they're a good starting point in learning photography. These cameras are basically digital versions of the original SLR camera but offer much more flexibility and many more options. Whagt we're seeing right now, however, is a switch from DSLR's to \\\"mirrorless cameras\\\", including the very popular \\\"Micro Four Thirds\\\" cameras which use a smaller sensor, yet often outperform the DSLR's. I'll touch on those, below. Anyway, an inexpensive or used DSLR is a good choice for starting out and I'd recommend an entry level Canon DSLR such as one of the \\\"Rebel\\\" series cameras. I currently use a Canon 1DX which is NOT a beginner's camera, and my old Canon 5D Mark II (this is a great beginner's camera, easy to find, and inexpensive.) Here's a photo of the Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm prime lens attached:  Mirrorless Cameras  These cameras really are \\\"the future of photography\\\" although many professional photographers would scoff at you for even suggesting such a thing because just as it was when SLR's were phasing out, DSLR using pro's often get stuck in their ways and refuse to move with the times. Even today there are professional photographers who refuse to switch from SLR to DSLR! Mirrorless cameras are superior to DSLR's in almost every way: They have higher resolution (megapixels) for a fraction of the cost of DSLR's; there's no mirror flapping around making noise and causing camera vibration; they're smaller and easier to carry, many can shoot 4K and even Cinema 4K video (while Canon and Nikon refuse to adapt and offer this feature for a reasonable price in their DSLR's); and overall, they're less expensive. If you can afford one (they're often cheaper than many new DSLR's), go for it! I currently shoot with a Panasonic Lumix GH4 because I shoot photography AND I need to shoot 4K video and this camera does both. An even less expensive alternative is the Lumix GH3 which sells for around $500, a quarter of the price of the GH4. Here's a photo of the Lumix GH4, a \\\"mirrorless camera\\\":  Regardless of what you choose, unless it's a cheap $30 point-and-shoot or your phone's camera, try to make a decision on which camera format you want to grow into, otherwise you'll be wasting money on a camera and the expensive lenses that you'll end up not using when you switch to a different format.  Taking an introductory photography class or workshop is also a good idea when getting started as you'll more quickly learn the basics including aperture, exposure, shutter speed, composition, and editing.

While one photographer will swear by his Canon, another will insist her Nikon is the better option. So which camera is best? That's a matter of opinion\\u2014but that doesn't mean the individual camera brands don't have characteristics that may make them more suited to one type of photography or one type of photographer over the other.  When comparing Canon vs. Nikon side-by-side, there are a lot of similarities, like solid image quality and a wide range of accessories, but there's a lot of differences too\\u2014some subtle, others, not so much.  Canon Vs. Nikon: Sensors  Both Canon and Nikon offer cameras powered by similarly sized sensors, but there's a lot more that goes into image quality than just the size of the sensor. Just when one manufacturer seems to leap forward in sensor technology, the other catches up.  Most of Nikon's latest DSLRs use a new sensor design that allows them to eliminate the optical low pass filter without an abundance of moir\\u00e9, or distortion in fine lines and patterns. The filter is one more thing for the light to pass through before hitting the sensor, so eliminating it allows the camera to pick up more details and perform a bit better in low light. All of Nikon's 2015 APS-C sensor cameras don't use an optical low pass filter and a handful of their full frame professional models have eliminated it as well.  Canon's latest DSLRs, on the other hand, seem more focused on the megapixels. Most of Canon's DSLRs still use an optical low pass filter, though there are options like the Canon EOS 5DS R that do without. Their latest big announcements come in the form of full frame DSLRs with a whopping 50 megapixels. While judging a camera on megapixels alone is like judging a book by its cover, the EOS 5DS does capture a 8688 x 5792 resolution, where the Nikon D810 with 36 megapixels captures at most 7360 x 4912. The higher resolution allows for larger prints and more cropping without affecting the image quality.  While the two are focusing on different areas of sensor technology, Canon and Nikon DSLRs both have excellent image quality. That doesn't mean you'll get the exact same image when shot with two different cameras, though. Colors between the two options can be noticeably different, for example. Which one produces better color is a matter of personal preference\\u2014they are simply different, there's no right or wrong answer.  Canon Vs. Nikon: Speed  Canon and Nikon come in pretty even as far as the speed of their autofocus, but there's a subtle difference in their burst speed rates. Speed is hard to come by in DSLRs\\u2014where it's not uncommon to find a mirror-less camera with a 10 fps burst mode, DSLRs have more gear to move to take a picture and it's tougher to reach those high speeds.  Canon tends to have faster high-end DSLRs. The Canon EOS 7D Mark II ($1,799) hits an excellent 10 fps burst rate, making it one of the top DSLRs for sports shooters. Nikon's fastest APS-C camera, on the other hand, is capable of 6 fps, the D7200 ($1,199). Getting even further into the advanced options, Canon's full frame 1D X hits 14 fps, where the similar Nikon D4S gets 11 fps.  When it comes to the entry-level, more budget friendly models, however, Nikon offers more speed. It's usually just by a frame or two though, as when comparing the Nikon D7200's 6-7 fps to the Canon T6S's 5 fps.  Canon Vs. Nikon: Operation  Performance between the two brands is pretty similar, but there are some noticeable differences when it comes to operating each camera. The terminology on a Canon is different from that on a Nikon, for starters. The S on the Nikon's mode dial and the Tv on the Canon both indicate shutter priority mode, for example. Nikon also uses simpler terminology for autofocus modes\\u2014it's a bit simpler to remember what Continuous Autofocus is versus Al Servo Autofocus (they're both the same thing).  There's also often a significant difference in battery life, with Nikons generally able to take more shots on a single charge. For example, the Nikon D7200 has double the battery life of the similarly priced Canon T6S. That's not the case with every model, but, more often than not, Nikons have a better battery rating.  Canon Vs. Nikon: Video Quality  Canon, traditionally, has offered better video quality sooner. They were the first to develop a hybrid autofocus system allowing the camera to refocus while recording. Canon is known for their better autofocus tracking while recording, and they also have a selection of lenses designed specifically for video.  Answering which brand has the better video quality two years ago would have been much simpler. Where a few models ago Nikon didn't offer autofocus while recording video, their latest DSLRs offer continuous autofocus. Comparing models individually across the brands, Nikon even has some cameras with a 60 fps frame rate for smoother motion where the equivalent Canon has 30 fps. Canon traditionally offers the better video, but Nikon's latest developments put them much closer.  Canon Vs. Nikon: Options  When it comes to the more advanced DSLRs, there's pretty much a Canon to match every Nikon. That's not always the case though. Nikon hasn't yet come up with an answer to Canon's speedy 10 fps EOS 7D Mark II, and Nikon has a camera designed specifically for astrophotography, the D810A, where Canon's similar option has a smaller APS-C sensor.  When it comes to entry-level options, however, Canon's selection doesn't quite match up with Nikon's models. There are older Canon DSLRs available for around $500, but the current models (as listed on Canon's website) start at $899 for the body only for the EOS 60D. Nikon's D3300 offers full DSLR capability to beginners for a $650 list price\\u2014and that includes a kit lens. Canon offers a model priced fairly evenly with the enthusiast Nikon D7200, the T6S, but there are some pretty significant differences. The D7200 has no optical low pass filter, 51 autofocus points, 60 fps HD video, 6-7 fps burst shooting and an 1,100 shot battery life. The T6S, by comparison, has an optical low pass filter, 19 focus points, 30 fps HD video, 5 fps burst shots and half the battery life. Where the specs are close in the high-end models, Nikon often offers more in their entry and enthusiast options (though again, that's not always the case).  Canon Vs. Nikon: So which one is best?  Buying a DSLR is a bit different than buying a compact camera, because once you start accumulating lenses, it becomes much more expensive to change brands. Since the two brands operate a little differently (and with different terminology), switching would also mean relearning a few minor things.  So, then, which manufacturer is best? Which camera brand should you choose?  The answer? There isn't a winner\\u2014both Canon and Nikon offer excellent cameras with solid image quality. If one brand offered a better camera every time, the other would've gone out of business a long time ago.  But, that's not to say one brand isn't more suited to one person or the other. Beginners would likely be happy with a DSLR from either system\\u2014but Nikon offers a more affordable option that's still full of features and Nikon's terminology is a bit easier to understand when starting from scratch. Sports photographers can capture the action with a DSLR from either manufacturer\\u2014but Canon tends to offer more speed in their high end models. Quality videos can be shot on both\\u2014but Canon typically has a smoother autofocus and offers lenses specifically for cinema.  When choosing between camera brands, it's best to compare each camera individually\\u2014where Nikon may have a better entry-level DSLR, Canon may have a better DSLR for sports.  When making the choice between Canon vs. Nikon, here are a few things to consider:   * What is the most important thing in a camera to you? Speed? Resolution? Video quality?  * What does the manufacturer offer at your current experience level and for your current budget?  * What does the manufacturer offer that you might be looking to upgrade to in the future? While you probably won't be looking at the same options in five years, if they offer something in that range currently, they're likely to continue to making updates to that line.  * What lenses would you ideally like to add to your kit? Does that manufacturer offer those lenses? Canon or Nikon? Neither one is a bad choice, which means it's not an easy choice."}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Canon-EOS-650D-any-good", "question": "Is the Canon EOS 650D any good", "answers": [{"upvote": 4, "content": "Any good? Well, most any camera at this level or above has been a good camera for more than a decade. With the intense competition in the camera industry, you don't any longer have poor cameras. I expect there are tens of thousands of exposures made on this camera today with the shooters being highly pleased with the results.  That said, it is in essence a five year old computer. Still very usable, but compared to a 2017 computer, it has significantly less power. A tad slower to start, a bit slower to focus, overall just a bit less responsive. It demands a bit more care by the user. The current model\\u2014the 800D\\u2014is $100US cheaper to buy new. The current sensor is 24MP compared to 18MP, which is not very significant. The sensor maxes out at 1.0EV\\u2014again not very significant unless you do much of your photography in very low light.  Currently, the 800D has considerably more sophisticated auto focus than the 650D, both in numbers of sensors and focus options. In all, the 800D is the 650D with five years more advanced technology. No point in comparing it to other 2012 competitors. They were all about similar back then and they are all quite similar now. In both cases, you pretty much get what you pay for.  In any case, you have an entry-level camera contemporary to the time it was marketed. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Entry level cameras are engineered to help take up the slack of entry-level photographers no matter who builds and markets the camera.  For those entry-level photographers who dream of buying a pro-level camera in hopes of spending less than the 10,000 hours to become an expert, they are hugely deluded. Pro-level cameras do exactly what the photographer tells them to do\\u2014nothing less, nothing more. Unless you fully understand both camera operation and photography, they can be a horrible and very expensive mistake to buy. They assume that three inches behind the viewfinder, there is a mind that totally understands what is wanted and the camera delivers. Pro-level cameras require the services of a pro-level mind and experience level. They offer no help for the beginner.  If you can afford a newer model, you will be rewarded by more contemporary technology and image quality. You will also be rewarded by a camera that will be satisfactory for a number of years longer than the 650D. If you buy the 650D, you will get the image quality of an entry-level 2012 camera, which may be highly acceptable. Just be aware that Gordon Moore's Law still applies today as it did in 1964.

Do not get this line of thinking stuck in your head because it's not entirely true. In fact, to be honest, this statement is used many times by people who simply can't afford good gear and are jealous at those who can. If you can't afford good gear right now, that's fine; work with what you can afford and save up money to grow into better gear over time. The best camera is always the one you have with you and by this I mean, if you own a $6,500 Canon 1DX and it's sitting at home, your best camera may be the free one that came built into the phone in your pocket!  While it is true, skill is the most important aspect of almost anything, including photography, your gear and even more specifically, your lenses, are just as important. A good lens on an inexpensive camera is always better than a cheap lens on an expensive camera. If you're just starting out and looking for a camera for a beginner, try to think about what sort of photography you'll be doing. General photography such as family photos, photos of your friends, pets, etc.; landscape photography; wildlife photography; street photography, etc. If you don't know yet, that's okay but if you have a goal of developing skills specific to one of these styles, it will help with camera selection.  When getting started, I'd get something inexpensive but not so cheap that your photo quality ends up discouraging you altogether (again, this is where the \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" nonsense kicks in.) I'll cover a couple types and why they're good starter cameras. And with any camera you choose, always try to keep the camera out of \\\"automatic mode\\\" if possible so you begin to master the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  Point-and-Shoot or Camera Phone  These cameras are very inexpensive and with the newer smartphones, the camera is built right in and often takes better photos than the DSLR's from just a few years ago! This is the most inexpensive route to take (and may not cost a penny if you use the camera on your phone) and it helps you learn about composition, lighting, etc. If you're already past this point and want a camera you can grow into, the following are good options:  Traditional SLR's  I know, this is probably not what most people think of when deciding on a beginner's camera but I want to mention it because if you have one of these lying around in your house (parent's or grandparent's old camera, etc.), they're great for learning the basics of a camera with all of the digital stuff removed. SLR (single lens reflex) cameras aren't used much anymore because of the cost of operation, decreased photo quality, and lack of film processing labs, however, I think any aspiring photographer should own or at least use one because they are the \\\"original camera\\\", they are inexpensive, and they help give you a greater appreciation for the luxury of digital photography (not limited to 24-36 photos per roll, immediate results where you can see your photo seconds after taking it, easy and fast multiple frame shooting, and no cost by ruining a roll of film or wasting it on bad photos.) If you buy a traditional SLR 35mm camera, I'd go for something like the Nikon 35mm F2AS with a 50mm \\\"prime lens\\\", or similar. Here's a photo of one of mine:  Digital SLR's  Digital SLR's, or DSLR's, have been the most popular choice for many years now, they're easy to find used, and they're a good starting point in learning photography. These cameras are basically digital versions of the original SLR camera but offer much more flexibility and many more options. Whagt we're seeing right now, however, is a switch from DSLR's to \\\"mirrorless cameras\\\", including the very popular \\\"Micro Four Thirds\\\" cameras which use a smaller sensor, yet often outperform the DSLR's. I'll touch on those, below. Anyway, an inexpensive or used DSLR is a good choice for starting out and I'd recommend an entry level Canon DSLR such as one of the \\\"Rebel\\\" series cameras. I currently use a Canon 1DX which is NOT a beginner's camera, and my old Canon 5D Mark II (this is a great beginner's camera, easy to find, and inexpensive.) Here's a photo of the Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm prime lens attached:  Mirrorless Cameras  These cameras really are \\\"the future of photography\\\" although many professional photographers would scoff at you for even suggesting such a thing because just as it was when SLR's were phasing out, DSLR using pro's often get stuck in their ways and refuse to move with the times. Even today there are professional photographers who refuse to switch from SLR to DSLR! Mirrorless cameras are superior to DSLR's in almost every way: They have higher resolution (megapixels) for a fraction of the cost of DSLR's; there's no mirror flapping around making noise and causing camera vibration; they're smaller and easier to carry, many can shoot 4K and even Cinema 4K video (while Canon and Nikon refuse to adapt and offer this feature for a reasonable price in their DSLR's); and overall, they're less expensive. If you can afford one (they're often cheaper than many new DSLR's), go for it! I currently shoot with a Panasonic Lumix GH4 because I shoot photography AND I need to shoot 4K video and this camera does both. An even less expensive alternative is the Lumix GH3 which sells for around $500, a quarter of the price of the GH4. Here's a photo of the Lumix GH4, a \\\"mirrorless camera\\\":  Regardless of what you choose, unless it's a cheap $30 point-and-shoot or your phone's camera, try to make a decision on which camera format you want to grow into, otherwise you'll be wasting money on a camera and the expensive lenses that you'll end up not using when you switch to a different format.  Taking an introductory photography class or workshop is also a good idea when getting started as you'll more quickly learn the basics including aperture, exposure, shutter speed, composition, and editing.

The recent controversy is over Dawkin's review of Wilson's 2013 book on the evolution of sociality: The descent of Edward Wilson [ http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/science-and-technology/edward-wilson-social-conquest-earth-evolutionary-errors-origin-species ]. https://www.amazon.com/Social-Co...

However, Wilson in the new book, moves away from the standard theory that the evolution of sociality depends on kin selection (supported by Darwin and William Hamilton) toward a much less popular view that group selection is more significant. Group selection essentially means that the unit of selection is the group rather than the individual (together with its inclusive fitness).  Most evolutionary biologists tend to agree with Dawkins on this. In fact, Wilson's original 2010 paper on this subject was formally attacked in Nature by 140 evolutionary biologists: http://ped.fas.harvard.edu/files... [ http://ped.fas.harvard.edu/files/ped/files/nature09836.pdf ] several of whom I can personally attest to knowing what they are talking about.  Wilson has a propensity for collaborating with mathematicians on highly technical papers that I doubt he fully understands. And then, even when other mathematical population biologists refute him, he stands by his first publication.  As an aside: I have seen attacks on Dawkin's The Selfish Gene on Quora. The attacks are based largely on straw man arguments. Natural selection can take place on many levels. Sometimes (as with transposons) it is worth focusing on the gene. In any case, for the most part individuals are \\u2018selected' but populations change their gene frequencies. Dawkins is not claiming any different; he simply was reminding us that if you want to see how evolution works, focus on the success of genes.  I am a mathematical population biologist with a PhD in evolutionary genetics from one of the best schools in that field. And I am a trained Hymenopterist, with a special interest in bees. So I have some perspective and little bias in this debate. I have read most of Wilson's and Dawkin's books and many of their papers. They are both great scientists. But on this particular topic, I agree with the 140 Nature correspondents mentioned above that kin selection is almost surely the driving force behind the evolution of sociality in ants, wasps and bees.  There is much more to be said about the problems of group selection.  Group selection surely occurs. The question is whether the amount of group selection is sufficient to outweigh individual selection (including the inclusive fitness of individuals). There are far more individuals than coherent social groups in a species, and in most cases the rate of natural selection on the individual is faster also.  Extreme forms of group selection, such as species selection (as championed by Gould, Stanley, Vrba) also occur, but how many species are there compared to individuals? How fast is speciation compared to mutation?  So the Gouldian (and now Wilsonian) argument that selection can occur at many levels has some technical validity, but it seems unlikely to do much of the heavy lifting of adaptive change in the real world."}, {"upvote": 3, "content": "I don't know the \\u2018all about'.

However, Wilson likes to emphasize the natural selection. He focuses on how the differences in morphology help the individual organism survive. He takes a holistic approach to the organisms body. Dawkins likes to emphasize the de novo mutation. He likes to emphasize how the differences in biology helps different genes survive. He concentrates on how the gene distributions change.  E. O. Wilson prefers to \\u2018ignore' the fine details of genetics in his work. He knows very well that the main differences between organisms are genes. He loves to present beautiful photographs showing what the organism does without any calculation or numerical comparison. He keeps on gushing about the beauty of the pictures, without any consideration of mathematics.  He is not quantitative at all. He doesn't actually look at the statistics. His books involve straight on observation without any calculation. He does not show simplified diagrams. He does not talk about probabilities. He just talks about survival of the fittest and thats it! He loves photographs, always in vivid color.  Wilson's audience consists of abstract thinkers who don't like deduction. They avoid long chains of deduction. They hate mathematical symbols. They prefer one detailed picture showing one special case of the conclusions.  Dawkins audience apparently consists of concrete thinkers who don't like ambiguity. They love simplified diagrams that presenting the conclusions in an unambiguous way . They don't want quantitative calculations. They avoid abstract concepts.  Dawkins prefers to \\u2018delay' discussion of the fine details of morphology. He starts out talking about genes to the extent that we understand them. After he reviews genes, he starts focusing on how the chances of survival are helped or hindered by the gene. He then tells us how the morphology of the organism relates to the gene distributions.  Dawkins dwells on the mathematics. His books don't have beautiful pictures. He sometimes talks about the beauty of the mathematics. He shows lots of simplified diagrams and almost no photographs. His diagrams are generally line illustrations with sometime a touch of gray.  I am very much a Dawkins reader. He is my favorite science author. However, sometimes I pick up an E. O. Wilson book. I love those beautiful pictures. I also sometimes learn specific details better through a picture than through a tightly written paragraph.  That I believe is the main issue. There is a minor issue.  Dawkins is a militant atheist. He has written entire books promoting atheism, which I have avoided. Wilson is more of an avoider. He prefers not to mention religion at all.  Here I have to go with Wilson. I am an avoider, too. I don't like to be preached at, and I can appreciated religious people who don't like to preach.  I prefer to be told WHAT is happening rather than WHAT IS NOT happening.

Gould and Lewontin stupidly argued that because the last chapter of Sociobiology pointed to credible evolutionary (hence genetic) influences even on human behaviors like warfare, racism, and sexual discrimination, Wilson was arguing that because these are in our genes we could do nothing about them\\u2014or worse, that he was defending or justifying them, that he was a racist. Wilson was doing nothing of the sort, but a lot of people's radical politics put them in a state of blind rage against him. This was a real low point in Stephen Jay Gould's thinking, I feel, and Lewontin was even worse. Students tried to shout Wilson down at academic lectures where he spoke (or tried to) around the country.  The next time Wilson lectured at FSU was late 1975, when the controversy burned hotly in media from the New York Times to Playboy and Mother Jones magazines. This time, FSU had to reserve the largest auditorium on campus. Even the balcony was packed, and for lack of seats, people stood crammed together along the aisles. As I arrived at the lecture, other students were pacing back and forth in front of the lecture hall carrying anti-Wilson signs. During his lecture, a group of women halfway back in the auditorium stood and began shouting in unison, No free speech for racists! No free speech for racists! They had to be removed from the auditorium by security officers.  I needn't go into any refutation of these asinine accusations against Wilson. Suffice it to say, his writings showed how such things as xenophobia, tribal warfare, male dominance, and even rape could have favored reproductive success in the early history of the species, and thus been selected for and embedded in our genes. But he was not saying these are good, desirable, or even defensible behaviors in modern society. To me, arguing that Wilson was defending these things is like arguing that a professional epidemiologist is in favor of epidemics, or that a parasitologist (which I was then becoming) is in favor of parasites and saying we can't do anything about them! The scientific quest is to understand, not to defend or justify.  Wilson, like myself, was a card-carrying Secular Humanist and significant figure in and to the American Humanist Association. We both received distinguished awards from the AHA. As a Humanist, Wilson was, prima facie, a liberal thinker and keenly opposed to racism, sexism, warfare, and the other evils of human nature. He proposed evolutionary interpretations of such things, but he believed firmly and wrote cogently about our ability to transcend them\\u2014that we are behaviorally influenced by our genes, but not slaves to them. We have the free will to chose whether to follow the tug of instinct (like having the urge to kill someone who has infuriated or wronged us) or to follow our better nature (like realizing it would be bad for oneself and for society to act on some of our urges).  Getting back to my personal acquaintance with him, it was two years after he published Sociobiology that I finished my PhD research and landed a professorship at a small college in Georgia, where one of my assignments was to teach comparative animal behavior. By that time, I had met Wilson three times, but again, only to the extent of post-lecture handshakes and a few words of commentary or a question.  About two years into my faculty appointment in Georgia, I added a new course to the curriculum, Sociobiology. Social behavior and its evolution was such a fascinating field to me that it was hard to do justice to it in a general animal behavior course that had to cover so many other topics\\u2014migration, predation, learning, instinct, sensory functions, behavioral endocrinology, aggression, etc. So from that point on, I taught Comparative Animal Behavior spring quarter of odd-numbered years and Sociobiology spring quarter of even-numbered years.  It was at the time of instituting the sociobiology course that I first wrote to Wilson, mentioned that I'd met him a few times, and told him about adding my course to our curriculum and the inspiration he had been to me. He warmly answered my letter with appreciation for my getting the subject taught regularly on my campus. I never met him again in person, and I didn't wish to pester him with letters either numerous, adulatory, or expecting replies. I'm not the pestiferous, fawning hero-worshiper type. But we did exchange about three or four more letters over 20 or 30 years and he was always generous in his replies.  Years later than my sociobiology letter, when I had made good with my own books, I was able to endow several biology scholarships. I wrote to ask his permission to name one in his honor and with the express purpose of furthering his legacy. He replied in his usual style with warm appreciation, enclosing the aforesaid check as a personal contribution to the fund. Our university foundation has scholarship recipients write letters of thanks to the donors (if living) with a few words about the student's major and career plans. When I received these letters from recipients of the Wilson Scholarship, I forwarded them to Ed, and he was very happy to read them.  One of my last, but indirect, contacts with him is that Ed Wilson and Paul Simon partnered for Paul Simon's final musical tour to raise money for tropical rainforest preservation. I took my family to Simon's appearance at the Cary, NC ampitheater. I bought the premium tickets that not only got us the best seats, but beyond that, added to the fund-raiser. If I remember right, it was to purchase as much native Amazonian acreage as possible to permanently protect it from timbering, mining, and farming. Wilson didn't tour with Simon (by that time and age, he wasn't able to travel much), so I didn't see him, but Simon did take a break in the music to speak of Wilson and the importance of this rainforest conservation endeavor.  I wrote to Wilson after the concert and asked his recommendation for what I might do, now that I had appreciable disposable cash from book royalties, to contribute to the rainforest or related conservation endeavors. He knew already that I've been one of the largest private contributors to conservation efforts in the Gal\\u00e1pagos Islands. He replied that he thought the best thing I could do was continue what I was already doing in the Gal\\u00e1pagos and in locally fostering the careers of new future scientists\\u2014to promote student careers in biology and environmental science, and keep his own aspirations and ideals alive in the minds of these students. What any of these students might go on to do, one can only imagine. I hope it's good.  To me Wilson was, in short, the epitome of gentleman and scholar; a brilliant and kindly man whose legacy will live as long as Darwin's. I've done my part to further that legacy and his memory by incentivizing promising students to show familiarity with his work and aspire to carry on his ideals through their own careers.  I hope you've enjoyed this tribute and didn't tune out because of the length. And I hope you will remember E. O. Wilson and think of him as favorably as I do."}, {"upvote": 91, "content": "About most evolutionary matters, Wilson and Dawkins probably agree.  The recent controversy is over Dawkin's review of Wilson's 2013 book on the evolution of sociality: The descent of Edward Wilson [ http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/science-and-technology/edward-wilson-social-conquest-earth-evolutionary-errors-origin-species ]. https://www.amazon.com/Social-Conquest-Earth-Edward-Wilson/dp/0871403633/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1509378267&sr=1-4-fkmr0&keywords=e+o+wilson+evolution++sociality  Wilson is, as Dawkins fully recognizes, a great expert on ants and the evolution of sociality. However, Wilson in the new book, moves away from the standard theory that the evolution of sociality depends on kin selection (supported by Darwin and William Hamilton) toward a much less popular view that group selection is more significant. Group selection essentially means that the unit of selection is the group rather than the individual (together with its inclusive fitness).  Most evolutionary biologists tend to agree with Dawkins on this. In fact, Wilson's original 2010 paper on this subject was formally attacked in Nature by 140 evolutionary biologists: http://ped.fas.harvard.edu/files/ped/files/nature09836.pdf several of whom I can personally attest to knowing what they are talking about.  Wilson has a propensity for collaborating with mathematicians on highly technical papers that I doubt he fully understands. And then, even when other mathematical population biologists refute him, he stands by his first publication.  As an aside: I have seen attacks on Dawkin's The Selfish Gene on Quora. The attacks are based largely on straw man arguments. Natural selection can take place on many levels. Sometimes (as with transposons) it is worth focusing on the gene. In any case, for the most part individuals are \\u2018selected' but populations change their gene frequencies. Dawkins is not claiming any different; he simply was reminding us that if you want to see how evolution works, focus on the success of genes.  I am a mathematical population biologist with a PhD in evolutionary genetics from one of the best schools in that field. And I am a trained Hymenopterist, with a special interest in bees. So I have some perspective and little bias in this debate. I have read most of Wilson's and Dawkin's books and many of their papers. They are both great scientists. But on this particular topic, I agree with the 140 Nature correspondents mentioned above that kin selection is almost surely the driving force behind the evolution of sociality in ants, wasps and bees.  There is much more to be said about the problems of group selection.  Group selection surely occurs. The question is whether the amount of group selection is sufficient to outweigh individual selection (including the inclusive fitness of individuals). There are far more individuals than coherent social groups in a species, and in most cases the rate of natural selection on the individual is faster also.  Extreme forms of group selection, such as species selection (as championed by Gould, Stanley, Vrba) also occur, but how many species are there compared to individuals? How fast is speciation compared to mutation?  So the Gouldian (and now Wilsonian) argument that selection can occur at many levels has some technical validity, but it seems unlikely to do much of the heavy lifting of adaptive change in the real world."}, {"upvote": 680, "content": "Well, Darwin has been dead for about 130 years and he certainly is called an eminent biologist.

He thinks that evolution can only act on the level of the gene, which is a view that's not tenable anymore (and not something to discuss here); go to the latter parts of this post (Ctrl+F: \\\"Below it lies another\\\") for summaries of the levels of selection debate: http://bioteaching.wordpress.com/2012/03/17/natural-selection/; I fall squarely in the Okasha, multilevel selection camp, because it's the only one that makes sense and applies to all of biology (precisely because it's modular and adaptable, unlike a strict gene selectionist or group selectionist view).  Now about this article by Dawkins. He makes some mistakes.    * \\\"In particular, Wilson now rejects kin selection\\\" No, he doesn't. He rejects inclusive fitness. This is a big mistake, yes, but it's kind of misrepresented when Dawkins puts it that way. He says kin selection theory, as based on Hamilton's Rule, is incomplete. And he's completely correct - Hamilton's rule needs some ironing out, just as has happened with it since its inception (it was modified to include the effects of diploidy or of inbreeding, for example).  Note that this is the view I get from the book. If he expresses kin-selection-denial in the media, I don't know, but it really would be silly of Wilson.   * \\\"group selection\\u2014the poorly defined and incoherent view\\\"  It hasn't been poorly-defined since the 1970s. The original Wynne-Edwardsian group selection was vague, yes, because \\\"group\\\" wasn't defined properly. It then got refined to make sense.  Also, note that kin selection is a variant of group selection. Just sayin'. This is why it would be silly and weird if Wilson denies kin selection (which he doesn't), and why it's silly for Dawkins to be such a fanboy for kin selection and refuse group selection.  The rest of the article is a standard romp through his gene-level view of evolution, which I cleared up in the post I linked above from which I'll copy the relevant passage:   %3E The misconception in the public [and propagated by Dawkins] about  selfish genes arises from the gene's eye view of things, which we  already saw is essential but also merely a consequence of our tools.  Samir Okasha, a prominent philosopher of biology who does a lot of work on the levels of selection issue (his book Evolution and the Levels of Selection is a must-read for the interested), outlined a way to resolve such  problems, and a way to visualise levels of selection in general. What is  clear is that even in cases of individual selection, there may be other  levels of selection at play \\u2013 multilevel selection.  Kin selection and group selection are reconcilable; gene selection and  kins election can play off of each other; etc. So what Okasha suggests  is that we view everything in terms of particles and collectives, with  natural selection acting on both. A particle can be an individual, with  the collective being a group or a population (species selection). A  particle can be a gene and the collective the individual.  In all cases though, we have to take the  gene's eye view in order to remain consistent \\u2013 our view of natural  selection is, after all, nothing more than statistical changes in gene  frequencies.  But this is where the misconception with  selfish genes comes from too. Just because we consider everything in  terms of genes, it doesn't mean that that's where evolution is acting.  It's merely a practical view; it's not an explanation. I cannot stress  this enough.   Dawkins's mistake is that he forgets that it's just a practical view and takes all these gene frequency changes as explanations. It's particularly mind-boggling to me as someone who specialises in macroevolution (and I do admit my own bias as a staunch cheerleader for traditional individual selection).  Note that this doesn't mean that Wilson's book is all right. There are a couple of grave errors in it, the foremost being his incomprehensible redefinition of eusociality to include humans as a eusocial species. But the criticism of kin selection was spot-on. Word on the street has it that there's a paper going to be published by a prominent player in this field, with a favourable refinement of Hamilton's Rule, which will make it accord with Wilson's, Nowak's, and Tarnita's 2010 firestorm paper."}, {"upvote": 133, "content": "No. A phobia is an irrational fear. In an age of proliferating WMDs, it is logical to fear all individuals who love imaginary people more than real people, who do not understand that death is real. It is also rational to hate primitive beliefs about the treatment of women, children, etc.   When apologists insist that violence that is disproportionately particular to Islam is not caused by the religion, this actually insinuates a racist explanation. The subtle suggestion is that these people are intrinsically, perhaps genetically, more homophobic, misogynistic and unreasonable. The criticism of the religion is the race-free analysis; it regards all humans as having the same intellectual and moral potential, with the problem in this case being bad instruction. Otherwise, we are encountering the racism that is most popular on the political left.  In America, racism from the political right treats non-white people as if they were animals; racism from the political left treats non-white people as if they were children. This is the condescending attitude of 'they just can't be expected to know how to behave', and people with this view feel that it is not appropriate to hold non-white people to the standards of (adult) white people. That's why certain crimes get disproportionate coverage in the media: liberal bigots expect those people to act that way, so it's not newsworthy. It's very easy to speak against a white pastor in the American South with homophobic and misogynistic views, but the same passion against an Islamic speaker with similar or worse views results in accusations of 'Islamophobia' because the standards have been lowered. Lowering expectations is a sign of disrespect to a person.   In the worst cases, liberals will pretend to not understand statements so that they can accuse others of being bigoted, which disguises against their own prejudices. For example, if someone says 'most suicide bombers are Muslims' there are those who will call the speaker Islamophobic and cry 'they don't all do it!' No one said they all do it, but of course these people are only pretending to not understand; they aren't actually so unintelligent as to not realize that 'X are Y' is different from 'Y are X'. Other examples (criminality and black people, etc.) inspire the same dishonest reaction, trying to force the opposition into a suspiciously specific denial.   Having to say 'I am not a racist' or 'I am not a sexist' is their victory, because when people have no evidence they will become offended as a tactic. When a person is screaming and crying it automatically makes the opposition look like a bully, and at the least it makes you look questionable in front of an audience that isn't paying close attention because it suggests that you actually said something racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. Your denial completes the picture: the crying, compassionate hero and the vicious, lying bigot. This is a generalization of Godwin's Law: as any argument proceeds, the probability of a frivolous accusation of racism/sexism/bigotry approaches 1.   And it is also dishonest: I refuse to believe that so many people are stupid enough to not realize that much of what is called 'offensive' is not offensive. Whiny people losing the argument can play the victim to trick others into helping them, but we should be less gullible."}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/Aside-from-Biden-signing-an-EO-do-democrats-understand-EOs-are-not-laws-and-states-don-t-have-to-abide-by-them", "question": "Aside from Biden signing an EO do democrats understand EOs are not laws and states don t have to abide by them", "answers": [{"upvote": 2, "content": "Do you understand that executive orders are instructions to the executive branch on how to carry out federal law?

I've never had a shutter failure in any camera I've owned, and several of them have gone far in excess of 100,000 image captures. I acquired a second-hand Canon 6D that was used for astro-photography that had over a quarter million actuations, and I put another 150,000 on it before selling it.

It'll fail for other reasons, but being worn out is not usually it.  A typical professional photographer (depending on type of photographer, of course, but wedding, portrait, event, etc.,) will usually shoot about 50,000 images a year, give or take. Spread out over two cameras, that's 25,000 per year, per camera. Most will consider 100,000 the best time to replace the camera because the camera still has value, is usually just still current or just one Mark number old. It's a good time to upgrade, because we don't have to worry about pushing our equipment on the backside of the MTBF curves, AND we get fresh new cameras with new features and sensors.

Yes they can. The smoke of a burning WiFi module is quite toxic and almost certainly carcinogenic. Swallowing a WiFi module is not safe either: there are many toxic metals and organic compounds which might be carcinogenic on prolonged exposure. Never ever eat WiFi or smell burning WiFi modules!  Considering the emitted radio waves, it could not be possibly more harmless. Note that we survived these:  Old analog NMT mobile phones transmitted at up to 60W continuous power. You could actually get an electric shock from a broken antenna insulation, or light up fluorescent tubes with the radio waves. Cancer studies were inconclusive, risk must be extremely low. Modern mobile phones transmit at 1\\u20132W, depending on the band, and transmission is time-multiplexed, active only in a fraction of the time. WiFi transmits at the 0.1W level, and it too is multiplexed, not continuous. Hundreds of times lower exposure, at most. Even if it's harmful, there is no hope to ever find statistically significant connection, due to the low energy levels involved.  On the other hand, non-ionizing radiation is used for therapeutic purposes: Diathermy - Wikipedia [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diathermy ]  Cancer is not listed as a risk. Quite the opposite, it's used (among others) in cancer treatment.

Otherwise it's every man/women for themselves and Hinata would be no different. I'm serious here, have you seen him on other teams? He'll give the bare minimum in support and expects everyone around him to hold their own for the most part. 2. I know that Sasuke is supposed to be on par in terms of power (as claimed by Kishimoto) but Naruto has way more chakra at his disposal so he's got the stamina to pull out bigger attacks for longer timeframes 3. On a bad day, Sakura is even with Hinata. This doesn't need explaining given the fact that Sakura is stronger, faster, can regen, has better canon defense, has Katsuyu, and has the Byakugou Seal. If Naruto's seal on Kurama could be opened with the bare minimum of chakra left to flood and force the chakra points open, there's no reason why Sakura's seal wouldn't work the same way. They're both external, sealed sources of chakra. They both can provide mass amounts of chakra all at once to force open the points. And they're both able to be released and maintained with minimal chakra levels. There's nothing that truly separates their ability to function in this specific circumstance. And Katsuyu of course can block and split to prevent damage, and appears to be nearly indestructible against blunt and explosive attacks. 4. Sakura can constantly heal Naruto from inside his protective chakra cloak so that he doesn't need to waste Kurama's chakra on healing himself. Sakura is protected from harm and Naruto can take hits without draining his chakra to fix it himself. Win-win 5. Unless Sakura's head is cut from her body or some other instantaneously fatal attack lands on her, she isn't dying when her Byakugou Seal is active. Both her and Naruto can basically cheat their ability to live (Naruto through Kurama and his Uzamaki lifeforce) whereas niether Hinata or Sasuke have the ability to save themselves from severe damage. 6. Hinata\\u2026unfortunately doesn't add much in the fight. She doesn't have a summoning like the others, she doesn't have solid a way to assist Sasuke in support techniques that would be useful in this battle, and she has never once fought alongside him before. She wouldn't be able to keep up with the fight and Sasuke being a solo player is going to hurt her. She needs him if she wants to land any big hits on Naruto or Sakura due to his space-time techniques. 7. Naruto has so many frog summonings by the end of Naruto that he could easily overwhelm Sasuke if he were to end up fighting by himself. 8. Sakura and Naruto are LOOOONG time teammates. Their strength is their ability to work together and fully support and understand the actions their partner makes. They've been fighting together long enough to know how to best adapt and utilize their strengths together, while both being aware of the other's weakness. It's a far better match up in terms of compatibility than Sasuke and Hinata, who only really know small chunks about how the other fights. "}, {"upvote": 81, "content": "Sakura wins.

Hinata, other than eventually marrying the 7th Hokage was still pretty much a very side character, went on to become the strongest Hy\\u016bga clan member (even surpassing the likes of her cousin-Neji). Hinata is arguably the second stongest kunoichi in Konoha (but, I argue Ino is stronger cause she doesn't have to touch anyone to possibly win a fight).   * In order to even unlock the Byakugan, one must undergo the extensive and rigorous Hy\\u016bga clan training.  * Using the coveted Hy\\u016bga abilities requires great chakra control & precision (so much so Hinata rivals a medical nin).  * Highly perceptive (not talking about the eye abilities)  * Learned the coveted Gentle Step Twin Lion Fists, a high level exclusive ability.  * Inherited a great deal of chakra from Hamura.

Do not get this line of thinking stuck in your head because it's not entirely true. In fact, to be honest, this statement is used many times by people who simply can't afford good gear and are jealous at those who can. If you can't afford good gear right now, that's fine; work with what you can afford and save up money to grow into better gear over time. The best camera is always the one you have with you and by this I mean, if you own a $6,500 Canon 1DX and it's sitting at home, your best camera may be the free one that came built into the phone in your pocket!  While it is true, skill is the most important aspect of almost anything, including photography, your gear and even more specifically, your lenses, are just as important. A good lens on an inexpensive camera is always better than a cheap lens on an expensive camera. If you're just starting out and looking for a camera for a beginner, try to think about what sort of photography you'll be doing. General photography such as family photos, photos of your friends, pets, etc.; landscape photography; wildlife photography; street photography, etc. If you don't know yet, that's okay but if you have a goal of developing skills specific to one of these styles, it will help with camera selection.  When getting started, I'd get something inexpensive but not so cheap that your photo quality ends up discouraging you altogether (again, this is where the \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" nonsense kicks in.) I'll cover a couple types and why they're good starter cameras. And with any camera you choose, always try to keep the camera out of \\\"automatic mode\\\" if possible so you begin to master the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  Point-and-Shoot or Camera Phone  These cameras are very inexpensive and with the newer smartphones, the camera is built right in and often takes better photos than the DSLR's from just a few years ago! This is the most inexpensive route to take (and may not cost a penny if you use the camera on your phone) and it helps you learn about composition, lighting, etc. If you're already past this point and want a camera you can grow into, the following are good options:  Traditional SLR's  I know, this is probably not what most people think of when deciding on a beginner's camera but I want to mention it because if you have one of these lying around in your house (parent's or grandparent's old camera, etc.), they're great for learning the basics of a camera with all of the digital stuff removed. SLR (single lens reflex) cameras aren't used much anymore because of the cost of operation, decreased photo quality, and lack of film processing labs, however, I think any aspiring photographer should own or at least use one because they are the \\\"original camera\\\", they are inexpensive, and they help give you a greater appreciation for the luxury of digital photography (not limited to 24-36 photos per roll, immediate results where you can see your photo seconds after taking it, easy and fast multiple frame shooting, and no cost by ruining a roll of film or wasting it on bad photos.) If you buy a traditional SLR 35mm camera, I'd go for something like the Nikon 35mm F2AS with a 50mm \\\"prime lens\\\", or similar. Here's a photo of one of mine:  Digital SLR's  Digital SLR's, or DSLR's, have been the most popular choice for many years now, they're easy to find used, and they're a good starting point in learning photography. These cameras are basically digital versions of the original SLR camera but offer much more flexibility and many more options. Whagt we're seeing right now, however, is a switch from DSLR's to \\\"mirrorless cameras\\\", including the very popular \\\"Micro Four Thirds\\\" cameras which use a smaller sensor, yet often outperform the DSLR's. I'll touch on those, below. Anyway, an inexpensive or used DSLR is a good choice for starting out and I'd recommend an entry level Canon DSLR such as one of the \\\"Rebel\\\" series cameras. I currently use a Canon 1DX which is NOT a beginner's camera, and my old Canon 5D Mark II (this is a great beginner's camera, easy to find, and inexpensive.) Here's a photo of the Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm prime lens attached:  Mirrorless Cameras  These cameras really are \\\"the future of photography\\\" although many professional photographers would scoff at you for even suggesting such a thing because just as it was when SLR's were phasing out, DSLR using pro's often get stuck in their ways and refuse to move with the times. Even today there are professional photographers who refuse to switch from SLR to DSLR! Mirrorless cameras are superior to DSLR's in almost every way: They have higher resolution (megapixels) for a fraction of the cost of DSLR's; there's no mirror flapping around making noise and causing camera vibration; they're smaller and easier to carry, many can shoot 4K and even Cinema 4K video (while Canon and Nikon refuse to adapt and offer this feature for a reasonable price in their DSLR's); and overall, they're less expensive. If you can afford one (they're often cheaper than many new DSLR's), go for it! I currently shoot with a Panasonic Lumix GH4 because I shoot photography AND I need to shoot 4K video and this camera does both. An even less expensive alternative is the Lumix GH3 which sells for around $500, a quarter of the price of the GH4. Here's a photo of the Lumix GH4, a \\\"mirrorless camera\\\":  Regardless of what you choose, unless it's a cheap $30 point-and-shoot or your phone's camera, try to make a decision on which camera format you want to grow into, otherwise you'll be wasting money on a camera and the expensive lenses that you'll end up not using when you switch to a different format.  Taking an introductory photography class or workshop is also a good idea when getting started as you'll more quickly learn the basics including aperture, exposure, shutter speed, composition, and editing.

There were websites and programs that could read it, usually for free. Unfortunately, at some point Canon stopped doing this, and the info is hidden in the system somewhere. There are only two apps I know of that can read cameras that are as recent as the 80D, and unfortunately they are not free.  The first one requires you to use an Apple, it's called ShutterCount (this used to be free but now cost $5.99 USD). I don't use Apple, so I can't say much about it, but I hear it works, and I think its a pay once, use always kind of app. There is a mobile version that requires you to connect via wifi from an iPhone or iPad, and users have complained that it is touchy. I think there is a version that works on Macs, but I just don't know, sorry.  The other app is on PC, and it's called EOSMSG, which I have used and it does work. BUT! Not only does it cost $5.18 USD, you have to pay that for every camera you want to read! So if you have two cameras, or if you buy a new camera, it's a new fee every time. The only saving grace is that once paid you can use it indefinitely on that camera, so you can check up on your count whenever you want. It's just aggravating that you have to pay for it again if you get a different camera or have more than one (I currently have 5).  If you know someone with the Apple version, see if they will let you try it out. Keep in mind, the info might not be 100% accurate. The only way to get a completely accurate count is to take it a Canon service center. But they are going to charge you to read it, and I'm not sure if they will do it as a single service, they might make you do something like a cleaning too. Either way, it's going to be more expensive this way than it would probably be worth to know.  To be honest, I feel like the only real reasons to know the shutter count is if you want to sell your camera, or if you bought a used one and want to see how much life it has left. The shutter is rated to 100,000 clicks on the 80D, which is a lot for a camera in it's class (mid-range). They have been known to last far beyond this count. If you just want to know just to know, it's not worth the money to learn the count.  I do want Canon to start adding this info, as they are one of the only ones that do not. At the very least on the mid-range models and up. But its not really that important to just know. Just for scale, I had an 80D for two years, used it for sports, wildlife, portraits, events, and just general shooting. When I sold it off, I had taken 18,000 photos.

Outside of that, there is little reason for concern. The rating is not a reflection of a hard limit in the camera, it is simply a rating for how long the shutter is expected to last. Sometimes they fail sooner due to some unforeseen damage. Sometimes they last well beyond that rating. Most people will never have a camera long enough to have to even worry about hitting it. They either replace the camera well in advance, or they just don't use it enough. For scale, I once had an 80D that I sold after two years of really putting it to use for sports and wildlife, as well as events and portrait work. It had 18,000 shots on the shutter when I sold it.

It doesn't suddenly shut the camera off, or lock you out in some way. It is simply a way to look at one model and compare it to another. So one that is rated to 50,000 shots is not as robust as one rated to 100,000. And since several models don't even give you the overall count anywhere in the data, there is really no reason to even worry about it. Just use your camera until it finally stops working, or you get new one. People report constantly that they far exceed the rating of the camera. I knew someone that had a 7D that made it to a million clicks.  Just one caveat. Though it is rare, sometimes a shutter will fail before it even reaches it's rating.  For scale, I had a Canon 80D for two years. In that time I took 18,000 photos. Which would far exceed any casual use, as I was a do it all type. Sports and events and wildlife ate up a lot of those shots. It is rated to 100,000 on the shutter.

I enjoy its light weight compared to the higher end models, its tilt-flip screen which makes shooting at angles easier and the layout of buttons is generally pleasing.  However after handling a Pentax k5 and a Canon 60D i find the grip a little small. But that is such a small factor to pay an extra $500 for.   Yes the 650D is a good cheap mid tier entry level camera that will allow you to experiment with photography and also get good results.  The one thing i did not consider was weather sealing. And this took its toll on my 650D when moisture got in and killed the camera making it unable to take photos for a week.   With the current range of cameras especially with Canon's announcement of the 70D and an upcoming 7DMk2 in two days time, i would invest more cash for a proper weather proofed 7D(older model but cheaper with the new announcement) or get a 70D with its better weather sealing and better sensor etc.   If cash is a concern the 650D is the best cheap DSLR canon has to offer in the time being.  Lens wise, a 18-55 is fine. Do buy the cheapo EF 50mm 1.8 canon lens. That is the best value for money lens that canon has. Take your time to experiment with these two. DO NOT rush to get lenses as some people do. As a hobby leisure photographer, you will at most use 2 -3 lenses.

In most kinds of shooting, you'll be able to manually zoom between 55 and 105 just by stepping forward a few dozen paces; the difference between 105 and 300 is much, much larger mathematically and experientially.  In fact, I'd really recommend that you buy a 18-55 and a 70 or 105-300, if you can manage it at about the same price, rather than an 18-105. That will cover more focal lengths and get you some distance shots, or shots of things like birds, that you wouldn't've gotten otherwise  If you're not worried about the 105-300 world, then I'd recommend that you buy an 18-55 that offers f/2.8 or lower throughout its range. Many \\\"walking around\\\" lenses like an 18-55 go from f/4 to f/5.5 depending on your zoom; f/2.8 is dramatically better than f/4 and you'll appreciate being able to zoom as far in as you want without the depth-of-field changing.  If you want to do one single thing to make your shots look more \\\"professional,\\\" it's use a wider aperture (smaller f/value) to blur the backgrounds and emphasize the subject. This also suggests that you should spend on the better 18/55.  Anthony's advice to stick with the kit lens until you know what you are going to use is also good. If you go out and shoot, you'll discover shots you wish you could get, and then you can buy the lens to go get them.

What are your primary purposes for owning the camera?  Once you define \\\"range\\\" for yourself, you may be able to get away with the 18-55mm. It's a decent lens and you can do a lot with it.  The 650D has a crop factor of 1.6x, so you'll actually get closer to 29mm-168mm with the larger lens. the 18-55 will translate into 29mm - 88mm.  If depth of field is a criterion for you, you'll want to take a look at the f-stop on your lens. Chances are it's a variable f-stop unless you're shelling out a good chunk of change for your lenses. The larger the f-stop number, the less light the lens will allow in, thus giving you more of your image in focus. (This can be manipulated.)

Do not get this line of thinking stuck in your head because it's not entirely true. In fact, to be honest, this statement is used many times by people who simply can't afford good gear and are jealous at those who can. If you can't afford good gear right now, that's fine; work with what you can afford and save up money to grow into better gear over time. The best camera is always the one you have with you and by this I mean, if you own a $6,500 Canon 1DX and it's sitting at home, your best camera may be the free one that came built into the phone in your pocket!  While it is true, skill is the most important aspect of almost anything, including photography, your gear and even more specifically, your lenses, are just as important. A good lens on an inexpensive camera is always better than a cheap lens on an expensive camera. If you're just starting out and looking for a camera for a beginner, try to think about what sort of photography you'll be doing. General photography such as family photos, photos of your friends, pets, etc.; landscape photography; wildlife photography; street photography, etc. If you don't know yet, that's okay but if you have a goal of developing skills specific to one of these styles, it will help with camera selection.  When getting started, I'd get something inexpensive but not so cheap that your photo quality ends up discouraging you altogether (again, this is where the \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" nonsense kicks in.) I'll cover a couple types and why they're good starter cameras. And with any camera you choose, always try to keep the camera out of \\\"automatic mode\\\" if possible so you begin to master the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  Point-and-Shoot or Camera Phone  These cameras are very inexpensive and with the newer smartphones, the camera is built right in and often takes better photos than the DSLR's from just a few years ago! This is the most inexpensive route to take (and may not cost a penny if you use the camera on your phone) and it helps you learn about composition, lighting, etc. If you're already past this point and want a camera you can grow into, the following are good options:  Traditional SLR's  I know, this is probably not what most people think of when deciding on a beginner's camera but I want to mention it because if you have one of these lying around in your house (parent's or grandparent's old camera, etc.), they're great for learning the basics of a camera with all of the digital stuff removed. SLR (single lens reflex) cameras aren't used much anymore because of the cost of operation, decreased photo quality, and lack of film processing labs, however, I think any aspiring photographer should own or at least use one because they are the \\\"original camera\\\", they are inexpensive, and they help give you a greater appreciation for the luxury of digital photography (not limited to 24-36 photos per roll, immediate results where you can see your photo seconds after taking it, easy and fast multiple frame shooting, and no cost by ruining a roll of film or wasting it on bad photos.) If you buy a traditional SLR 35mm camera, I'd go for something like the Nikon 35mm F2AS with a 50mm \\\"prime lens\\\", or similar. Here's a photo of one of mine:  Digital SLR's  Digital SLR's, or DSLR's, have been the most popular choice for many years now, they're easy to find used, and they're a good starting point in learning photography. These cameras are basically digital versions of the original SLR camera but offer much more flexibility and many more options. Whagt we're seeing right now, however, is a switch from DSLR's to \\\"mirrorless cameras\\\", including the very popular \\\"Micro Four Thirds\\\" cameras which use a smaller sensor, yet often outperform the DSLR's. I'll touch on those, below. Anyway, an inexpensive or used DSLR is a good choice for starting out and I'd recommend an entry level Canon DSLR such as one of the \\\"Rebel\\\" series cameras. I currently use a Canon 1DX which is NOT a beginner's camera, and my old Canon 5D Mark II (this is a great beginner's camera, easy to find, and inexpensive.) Here's a photo of the Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm prime lens attached:  Mirrorless Cameras  These cameras really are \\\"the future of photography\\\" although many professional photographers would scoff at you for even suggesting such a thing because just as it was when SLR's were phasing out, DSLR using pro's often get stuck in their ways and refuse to move with the times. Even today there are professional photographers who refuse to switch from SLR to DSLR! Mirrorless cameras are superior to DSLR's in almost every way: They have higher resolution (megapixels) for a fraction of the cost of DSLR's; there's no mirror flapping around making noise and causing camera vibration; they're smaller and easier to carry, many can shoot 4K and even Cinema 4K video (while Canon and Nikon refuse to adapt and offer this feature for a reasonable price in their DSLR's); and overall, they're less expensive. If you can afford one (they're often cheaper than many new DSLR's), go for it! I currently shoot with a Panasonic Lumix GH4 because I shoot photography AND I need to shoot 4K video and this camera does both. An even less expensive alternative is the Lumix GH3 which sells for around $500, a quarter of the price of the GH4. Here's a photo of the Lumix GH4, a \\\"mirrorless camera\\\":  Regardless of what you choose, unless it's a cheap $30 point-and-shoot or your phone's camera, try to make a decision on which camera format you want to grow into, otherwise you'll be wasting money on a camera and the expensive lenses that you'll end up not using when you switch to a different format.  Taking an introductory photography class or workshop is also a good idea when getting started as you'll more quickly learn the basics including aperture, exposure, shutter speed, composition, and editing.

This is the one big difference that decides everything, because anyone can build a centralized, highly scalable platform. You just pick a normal database and build on it.

You can make your research and if you find the platform deem fit then you can go ahead just like i did.  When it was first launched, the price of the EOS cryptocurrency sat at $2.29. However, it then doubled in less than 24 hours, with EOS hitting $5.40.  This hike did not last, however, and the coin soon started falling, breaking one support level after another. EOS found its bottom at $0.59, which is where it remained until late October 2017. Once the crypto bull run that marked the year reached its peak, EOS joined the rally, and it skyrocketed to $16.39 on January 13, 2018.  However, while most coins peaked around this date or earlier, EOS' all-time high came later, in April 2018. In mid-April, the crypto market \\u2013 which had been crashing since January \\u2013 started seeing a new bullish wave. Prices started going up, and many assumed that the so-called 'crypto winter' was over.  These days, we know that the surge in April was only the eye of the storm, as the crash continued as May 2018 arrived. But, for those few weeks, the EOS price jumped once more, breaking its former record, and going up to $22.89. This was the coin's highest price, and it has never reached these highs again, at least so far.  Following this second surge, EOS kept dropping, briefly stopped by support here and there, but eventually, it dropped to its new bottom at $1.86 around December 7, 2018. In 2019, the coin saw gradual growth, although it progressed slowly, and everything it had achieved by mid-2019 was undone in the second half of the year, as it slowly returned to the level where it sat ever since \\u2013 between $2 and $2.8.  The EOS price has fluctuated in this range, except for on three occasions in 2020. The first one was between mid-January and mid-February, when it joined another bull run that took it to $5.35. The second was in August 2020, when it hit $3.7, and the last one is right now, led by Bitcoin (BTC), which is once again approaching its all-time highs at $20,000.  EOS, on the other hand, is as far away from its own record as it can be, hovering around $3.26.  What is happening to EOS these days?  Unfortunately, EOS has not been making headlines in 2020, as the crypto industry is mostly focused on the decentralised finance (DeFi) sector. When DeFi started slowing down, bull runs took over, and most of the attention went to Bitcoin.  However, that does not mean that EOS has been doing nothing. Its developers at Block.one recently announced the EOS Resource Model proposal, and the soon-to-arrive review of various talented organisations that responded to the company's invitation to evaluate their code.  Block.one also recently expressed its pleasure with how Spielworks built a rewards and loyalty platform for gamers using EOSIO.  The company also worked on adding new features to its Training and Certification segment of the blockchain.  And, of course, as a development platform, EOS has also been making moves to attract people to develop new DeFi projects on its network. The network already has quite a few successful projects, although the majority of the developers are still focusing on developing DeFi on Ethereum.  EOS price prediction 2021: what to expect from EOS going forward?  Lastly, we arrive at the most interesting part \\u2014 EOS coin price prediction for 2021 and beyond.  According to TradingBeasts, the EOS price in December 2020 will reach a maximum of $3.4, after which the forecasting service expects it to drop back down to $2.7, on average.  In January 2021, its EOS crypto price prediction shows the coin remaining near this level, at around $2.7, later expecting it to experience a slow but steady rise throughout the year, with the coin having the potential to hit a high of $3.9 next December. The average price of EOS is predicted to reach $4.07 in December 2022, and then $5.03 in December 2023.  Wallet Investor also expects the currency's price to rise in early 2021, although their EOS coin forecast says that the asset will see a price crash in the second half of the year. The event will potentially lead EOS down to $1.2 one year from now.  As for CryptoGround, they have a very bullish EOS prediction. In fact, their EOS forecast claims that the coin will simply keep climbing, with its value reaching $4.17 in six months, $4.7 in one year, and $21.4 by December 2025."}, {"upvote": 17, "content": "EOS has the following unique benefits.  \\u25cf High transaction throughput: EOS enables the execution of millions of transactions per second, which means that it has high transaction throughput.  \\u25cf Free transactions for end-users: EOS provides the users to mine and execute a large number of transactions without any additional fees.  \\u25cf Governance based on user votes: Each transaction executed in EOS is bound to follow the rules laid down in the constitution.

Each of these concepts rely on blockchain technology which has been increasingly highlighted in the mainstream media as a revolutionary technology that promises efficiency and is shaking up the status quo, although it isn't quite a household buzzword.  Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency with mass appeal and is what many people automatically think of when the topic of blockchain or fintech comes up. However, although bitcoin has continued to grab headlines, there is a much bigger picture here and there are many other uses for blockchain apart from cryptocurrencies.  Blockchain has the potential to influence every aspect of the global economy and its applications are already developing faster than most governments or regulators can, or have been willing to, grapple with; although Bermuda has already impressively made significant legislative and regulatory advances garnering international attention.  We all conduct our lives increasingly online \\u2014 online banking, shopping, apps, social media, and online services. The execution of core functions of governments and economies are also increasingly on the internet. Most of us now have some sort of digital presence and all our online activities require the sending of information back and forth.  Blockchain is expected to impact the way payments, transactions and record keeping are handled in the future, and affect various other aspects of our daily lives, as well as the way that large organisations, financial institutions, and governments are run.  Transactions are at the heart of any blockchain in that an interaction with the blockchain involves the execution of transactions. The blockchain decentralised ledger keeps a record of all verified transactions and the transactions are organised into chunks of data called blocks that are irreversibly linked to one another \\u2014 forming a block chain.  Once a block is formed in the chain it cannot be reversed and is therefore immutable. Decentralisation, immutability, and transparency are key elements of blockchain.  We can take ethereum as an example. The ethereum platform is developed by the Ethereum Foundation, a Swiss non-profit, which has advanced the concept of blockchain technology beyond currency applications.  Ethereum is an open-source, public, blockchain-based platform that runs smart contracts to carry out transactions. Smart contracts are self-operating computer codes or programs that automatically execute when specific conditions are met and hence do not require third-party involvement. The fact that such technology cuts out the need for third parties means that third-party risk and costs are cut out of transactions.  It also means that no one organisation controls the data. Developers around the world can use ethereum to build and deploy their own decentralised applications based on the ethereum blockchain.  Etherscan is a search engine that allows users to easily lookup, confirm and validate transactions that have taken place on the ethereum blockchain. Hence, we have a large-scale tool for ensuring there is transparency with the technology.  No company owns ethereum, and there is no one person, executive or even a board of directors making decisions, which is truly remarkable. It has been noted that ethereum is, in fact, more like a democracy than any private corporation could ever be. People around the world can join the ethereum community and participate in the future of ethereum, enhancing its integrity and minimising the risk of corruption.  Blockchain technology creates a decentralised digital public record of transactions that is secure, tamper-proof, and unchangeable. Don Tapscott has an excellent Ted talk on blockchain and as he put it: So for the first time now in human history, people everywhere can trust each other and transact peer to peer. And trust is established, not by some big institution, but by collaboration, by cryptography and by some clever code.  A truly exciting aspect of blockchain is that it can potentially apply to any industry where information is transferred, or records must be kept \\u2014 from insurance to commodities to healthcare. We are seeing major industries joining in the blockchain movement.  The multitrillion-dollar commodity trading industry is currently looking at the potential of using blockchain technology to track and document the buying, selling and movement of goods.  The tracking of cargo through various ports and jurisdictions has traditionally been challenging for the industry, making fraudulent activities difficult to detect \\u2014 an issue that can be addressed by using blockchain technology to track and trace commodities. Energy companies BP and Royal Dutch Shell are among a consortium that is developing a blockchain-based digital platform for energy commodities trading.  Behemoths like JPMorgan, Berkshire Hathaway, and Apple have all expressed interest in blockchain technology and undertaken various blockchain exploratory projects. The list of companies and industries looking to blockchain to provide solutions and create more efficient systems continues to multiply.  Blockchain can also help prevent corruption in government. The implementation of systems of monitoring government spending, property registry and digital documents of citizens on the blockchain are all potential ways of ensuring governmental transparency and cutting back on corruption.  If every piece of property in a country is accounted for on an immutable blockchain registry, then governments or big corporations could not as easily take land from someone just because a person did not have certain documentation to prove ownership.  The risk of \\u2018land grabs' potentially exists in any country, no matter how developed, and indeed occurred recently in the United States in relation to the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock which was an act of land seizure that arguably occurred because of technicalities and confusion of property ownership in the United States.  Of course, all of this is not to downplay the risks that exist in relation to blockchain or other technological developments more generally. There are always risks that need to be considered and mitigated. Poor management, problems with the technology, personnel vulnerabilities and mistakes in programming could create a range of potentially serious issues. Blockchain is not a panacea.  However, when the right legislation and regulations are put into place, when the technology is used correctly, and when the right players are involved, these are powerful tools. Interestingly, VoIP (or Voice over Internet Protocol, such as Skype) used to be considered quite risky although it is now a mainstay of the worldwide telecommunications industry.  Whatever its future, the success of any blockchain project requires the appropriate management of risk regardless of the continuing maturity of blockchain technology and increased cross-industry awareness.  Don Tapscott summarised the potential power of blockchain quite aptly when he said  \\u2026 the technology genie has escaped from the bottle, and it was summoned by an unknown person or persons at this uncertain time in human history, and it's giving us another kick at the can, another opportunity to rewrite the economic power grid and the old order of things, and solve some of the world's most difficult problems, if we will it.  The potential applications of blockchain technology are growing exponentially because almost anything involving transactions or digital assets can be put on a blockchain. Our digital lives will likely develop to rely on blockchain technology without many of us even being fully aware of it. We are experiencing the evolution of how we do business and interact with each other."}, {"upvote": 158, "content": "In the cryptocurrency world, Cardano's Proof of Stake, ADA coin, and low-energy usage approach are getting a lot of traction.

Cardano's value will increase in the future years as it gains mass usage. Although it is unclear whether the market capitalization of ADA will expand much, one thing is certain: the anticipated price increase.  Wrapping up  Due to a variety of factors, Cardano's price is predicted to surge in 2022. Cardano is expected to enter the institutional adoption circle in the near future. The investment's worth will increase as it grows. The market's focus on supply and demand is expected to put ADA on the back foot. Demand-side factors have a bigger impact on price determination than supply-side factors due to the limited supply of bitcoin.

The projects is being led by the Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson who is trying to solve the problems that Ethereum has.   * They are using the proof of stake protocol - which is much faster and scalable.  * The protocol is desgined to protect privacy rights of users, while also taking into account the needs of regulators - They are the first protocol to balance these requirements in a nuanced and effective way, pioneering a new approach for cryptocurrencies.  * They are making smart contracts smarter increasing the computation power for a certain contract - Their Network will be able to run bigger algorithms on a DApp without clogging the system. The thing is that for Ethereum is pretty hard to implement this changes because it's already up and running - It's like changing the engine of a machine that is constantly moving.  Cardano's advantage is that they had time to acknowledge the problems and solve the issues in their own way.  But don't worry, Ethereum developers are constantly working on improving the network by implementing only great ideas like the Raiden Network which will be up and running by the end of 2018. - Faster and cheaper transactions which would lead to mass adoption.

And depend on what is your aim, T7i might going to be a better deal.  1. Depend on package deal T6 got, it is probably lousy deal. I am not huge fan of camera store package deal since lot of things they included are junk that does not have long term value especially when you became advanced photographer. Extra money that is spend on package deal is typically better spent buying decent lens. 2. Rebel T6 is Digic 4 camera, and Rebel T7i is Digic 7 camera. While I do not care for mega pixels, there are big performance difference between each respective generations of Digic processor as if it is almost as shooting different type of film. 3. Newer camera with more modern processor typically have better AF, and better video capability, better noise, and better color renditions which actually makes lot of difference if you are going care for these. Older DSLR even those with Digic / DigicII are still great, but there will be difference and you have to be sure you will like that type of difference. There are performance difference when you are shooting it in indoor poorly lit conditions as well. And T7i has 45 cross-type AF points, compared to only 9 AF points with 1 cross-type point in the center of T6. 4. While under well lit environment T6 and T7i image quality difference will be negligible for many purpose, if you are intended to use camera to capture life events, you will probably feel T6 shortcoming more frequently than you will like, and that difference might be deal breaker for your photography style. Bottom line,  If you think AF performance or video will be really important, get T7i, but if you are focusing on type of photography such as landscape, architecture, studio photography or other still object photography, T6 will be just fine.  For me, extra AF performance and image quality you will get with paying extra US$200 in MSRP worth it. But it could be different for you.

My suggestion would be to buy and shoot a few dozen memory cards worth of images on the very inexpensive 18-55. Find its limits, where it does well and where it doesn't, what causes aberration and where it is or isn't sharp. Are you always shooting at the 55mm end of it? Pick up a used 50 f1.8 for $40ish and your image quality will improve a bit at wide aperatures. Always at the low end? Consider the 10-22 for the extra wide angle. Zoomed all the way in and can't get your subject as large as you'd like? Consider the 70-300. Starting with the 18-55 gives you a great reference on focal length for the lowest price, and is a smart choice.  If you're into landscapes where you're shooting at smaller apertures, you're probably going to find that a good tripod affects your image quality more than upgrading to the $900 17-55 f2.8 that some have suggested.

Not only is the 1D X around $6,000 (body-only), but you're going to need expensive CFast cards for 4K video, and the 4K video on the thing is in gigantic Motion JPEG files, and not all that amazing anyway. If I wanted a 4K camera for video, I'd recommend either get a Panasonic GH4 or perhaps a Sony A7s mark II.  The Nikon D80 (2006) and the D3 (2007) are ancient models and don't shoot video. The D3s does shoot video, but only 720p, not full HD.  The EOS 7D (2009) is also fairly old. It can shoot 720p or 1080p video, but only 12 minutes at a time. The others here can shoot 29\\u203259\\u2033 without stopping \\u2014 that's a limit set to avoid paying a European camcorder tax. While it doesn't apply at all in the USA, most camera manufacturers (other than Panasonic, far as I know) impose this limit even on North American and Japanese models.  The Nikon D5300 isn't a bad choice for video. It's a few models old, it came out in 2003, the current model is the D5600, so it's may be available for a value price. But this line is a consumer line, APS-C sensor, and not terribly expensive. It can shoot video at 1080p up to 60fps\\u2026 not something you'd need for vlogging, but you want 60p for sports or other action video. Another advantage for vlogging, the D5300 has built-in WiFi, so it can be controlled wirelessly via an app. Most Canon and Nikon can be tethered via USB for remote control, and some have add-on controls, but it's handy to have it built-in.  I have the EOS 6D, and it produces amazing video, particularly in low light, where it blows away my far more expensive dedicated camcorders. The 6D right now is a good bargain, but mostly because everyone expects Canon to announce the 6D mark II Real Soon Now. The 6D also has built-in WiFi.  The EOS 5D mark III is the upgrade of Canon's breakthrough EOS 5D mark II. It's a great camera, one of the go-to standards for video-on-stills camera shooting. But while it's a solid choice if you can afford it, it's not the best choice. For one, it's been superceeded by the EOS 5D mark IV, if you're looking for a higher end model that shoots great video.  Of those on your list, the Canon EOS 80D would be my choice for anyone wanting a strong video option. Like the Nikon, it can shoot a variety of modes up to 1080p60. But the real advantage is in the sensor. This is Canon's second-generation mid-range DSLR with what they call a Dual Pixel sensor. This sensor splits each pixel into two separate photodiodes. Based on the way they're masked, each sensor pair works like a phase-detect autofocus sensor. So unlike every other DSLR on your list, the 80D can give you full performance autofocus in video, and things you usually just find on camcorders and mirrorless cameras, like follow-focus in video, etc. Dual Pixel is also used on Canon's 5D mark IV and all the new Cinema EOS video cameras. And the 80D also has built-in WiFi.  Far as the larger idea of a full camera system goes, you can't really go wrong with either Canon or Nikon. They have the two most complete lines of cameras and two most complete collection of lenses. However, neither offers a mirrorless option. So that means you're only shooting video from the back screen, not the viewfinder. And that only the 80D on your list has fully function video autofocus\\u2026 the others will AF in video, but it's on demand, not continuous, and it's often not very good. The phase detect sensors that DSLRs use are not available with the mirror up, which is what you have in video mode.  For one-person vlogging, keep in mind you are going to want to see yourself, which means either an add-on monitor while shooting or an articulated screen. The 80D and the D5300 both have fully articulated screens which let you see what you're recording from the front of the camera. The others do not, and will absolutely require an external monitor for vlogging."}, {"upvote": 16, "content": "It's a decent start, but it also tells you a few things about Canon's thinking right now. And I think they made some good decisions, and a few bad ones that may have not been choices as much as technical limitations.  Neither Canon nor Nikon were actually new to mirrorless with last August's introductions. But the R and the Z are professional formats, even if the first models are not a match for the top-of-the-line DSLRs yet. Both Canon and Nikon took on the idea that mirrorless was something less than DSLR, a step between DSLR and compact digital cameras (aka point and shoot). Nikon's 1 system used the same 1\\u2033 sensor size found in high-end P&S cameras like the Sony RX10 and RX100. But Canon put out a very compact APS-C system with their EOS M. And a funny thing happened: while Nikon's 1 system is now defunct, the EOS M is very popular, albeit not necessarily in the USA. Canon's been the #2 mirrorless brand in Japan in 2016 and 2017 (BCN rankings, second to Olympus) and looks to be taking the #1 spot for the 2018 year\\u2026 without even counting the EOS R. Canon seems to have nailed the consumer mirrorless ILC with the EOS M.  So it should be no surprise that Canon got into mirrorless on a higher level with the EOS R, but then again, it should be. Canon is slower to react to competition than just about anyone. Why this, why now? Canon feels the competition.  For most of history since maybe the 1940s or 1950s, Canon and Nikon had much of the professional market for cameras. In the 1960s, led by Nikon, they won an 80% share, and it's been pretty much 80\\u201390% ever since. Canon managed to flip the market share on Nikon by being the first to court consumers, and then by delivering the fastest speeds for pro sports shooters. But for a long time, the only 35mm, then full-frame choice for most pros was Nikon or Canon.  This last year, the whole industry sold only 11.6 million ILCs, less than half of those sold in 2013. And 2017 was actually an 8% increase from 2016. But more the point, DSLRs sold only accounted for 65% of the ILC market\\u2026 clearly, Nikon and Canon were no longer winning an 80\\u201390% share. And while Canon's mirrorless sales were up 70% in 2017, Nikon wasn't even part of that. And of course, neither was competitive with Sony, Olympus, Panasonic, or Fujifilm in higher-end mirrorless. No one knows just where the DSLR vs. mirrorless ratio settles out in the long term, but it's not going to be terribly favorable to any company only making DSLRs.  What's It For?  If you look carefully at the EOS R, like the Nikon Z's, you'll know just what it's for: the EOS R is a mirrorless body for Canon users to buy, so that they don't buy Sonys. This is the big factor. Canon users have been trying Sony A7s with adapters, and liking them. Some keep it as an accessory, but some sell their Canon gear and move to Sony. Canon needs that to stop, and their first reaction to this situation is the EOS R.  Canon's introducing one body and four lenses, two of them quite expensive, but still, that's not a full system for nearly anyone who needs a system camera. It's a start. But if you're already a Canon shooter, the R is with an adapter is going to let you try out mirrorless with all of your glass \\u2014 even EF-S lenses, but EF-M lenses are impossible \\u2014 your existing batteries and flash units, etc. It's a much simpler way to experiment with mirrorless for today's Canon shooter. If you're new to ILCs and want full-frame mirrorless, EOS R won't be a great option for at least 3\\u20135 years, depending on how quickly Canon rolls out new glass.  So you're supposed to compare the EOS R to a Sony A7 Mark III, but the closest match is actually the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV. So you're getting more or less a mirrorless 5D Mark IV with some improvements/extra features for $900 less. That's a pretty fine deal, speaking from the Canon universe. It's a bit more expensive than the A7 Mark III, but no one's more aggressive on body pricing than Sony.  I think it succeeds in its mission. If I still had my Canon system and was ready for full frame mirrorless, the EOS R is a no-brainer versus the Sony. It's not even the cost of the bodies or the minute details of the features, but the fact it's already part of my system. The cheap lens adapter is only $100, and it works perfectly. For a bit more, I could get the adapter with filter holder, simply brilliant for video work.  Video Issues  Alas, on that latter one, Canon's still being Canon, and not in a good way. They're still crippling 4K video on the EOS R, delivering the same 1.7x crop you have on the EOS 5D mark IV. If you're buying a full-frame DSLR for video, the point is to have full frame video. With that crop, you're better off going to a Panasonic GH5 or a Blackmagic Design Pocket Cinema Camera 4K, depending on your needs.  I expect for most stills work, you have a 5D Mark IV as far as the quality goes. You won't quite match Sony in very low light, but you'll have a bit more resolution in bright light, so it's probably not a big deal for most photographers. You'll have the Canon color, which Sony has yet to match, and the Canon menus you're used to\\u2026 well, maybe. They have a few new controls on the camera, which changes around the way its used. There's a programmable ring control on lenses, but you won't run into that with adapted EF lenses unless you get the third adapter, the one with the ring control. There's also a touch strip on the back, which most reviewers aren't yet crazy about.  Neither Sony nor Canon has 10-bit in-camera video, which is what you need for serious Log shooting. But the EOS R does have that as an external option, at least. I'd bet on Sony's A7S Mark III offering 10-bit in some fashion, but like Canon, Sony's got their own cinema camera business they feel compelled to protect by crippling the mirrorless models. Oddly, though, Nikon opted for the same thing, in-camera 8-bit, external 10-bit, even without a video market to protect. I guess that leaves them both with a feature to add to a higher end model, next year. Or save money and buy the GH5 right now.  Conclusions  So basically, I think the EOS R is attractive to anyone with a full Canon system thinking about mirrorless. If Canon's annoying behaviors haven't driven you away yet, this may well be your mirrorless. I don't really find any huge problems with it. Knowing that Sony was the initial target, nothing about the EOS R or the Nikon Zs were particularly unexpected. Both aim for the Sony's, Nikon at both the A7III and the A7RIII, Canon's basically doing the A7III competitor now. I would hope they're holding off an A7RIII competitor until they have some improved sensor tech, probably also going into the EOS 5DS Mark II."}, {"upvote": 2, "content": "If you are buying at a significant discount, then naturally.

Do not get this line of thinking stuck in your head because it's not entirely true. In fact, to be honest, this statement is used many times by people who simply can't afford good gear and are jealous at those who can. If you can't afford good gear right now, that's fine; work with what you can afford and save up money to grow into better gear over time. The best camera is always the one you have with you and by this I mean, if you own a $6,500 Canon 1DX and it's sitting at home, your best camera may be the free one that came built into the phone in your pocket!  While it is true, skill is the most important aspect of almost anything, including photography, your gear and even more specifically, your lenses, are just as important. A good lens on an inexpensive camera is always better than a cheap lens on an expensive camera. If you're just starting out and looking for a camera for a beginner, try to think about what sort of photography you'll be doing. General photography such as family photos, photos of your friends, pets, etc.; landscape photography; wildlife photography; street photography, etc. If you don't know yet, that's okay but if you have a goal of developing skills specific to one of these styles, it will help with camera selection.  When getting started, I'd get something inexpensive but not so cheap that your photo quality ends up discouraging you altogether (again, this is where the \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" nonsense kicks in.) I'll cover a couple types and why they're good starter cameras. And with any camera you choose, always try to keep the camera out of \\\"automatic mode\\\" if possible so you begin to master the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  Point-and-Shoot or Camera Phone  These cameras are very inexpensive and with the newer smartphones, the camera is built right in and often takes better photos than the DSLR's from just a few years ago! This is the most inexpensive route to take (and may not cost a penny if you use the camera on your phone) and it helps you learn about composition, lighting, etc. If you're already past this point and want a camera you can grow into, the following are good options:  Traditional SLR's  I know, this is probably not what most people think of when deciding on a beginner's camera but I want to mention it because if you have one of these lying around in your house (parent's or grandparent's old camera, etc.), they're great for learning the basics of a camera with all of the digital stuff removed. SLR (single lens reflex) cameras aren't used much anymore because of the cost of operation, decreased photo quality, and lack of film processing labs, however, I think any aspiring photographer should own or at least use one because they are the \\\"original camera\\\", they are inexpensive, and they help give you a greater appreciation for the luxury of digital photography (not limited to 24-36 photos per roll, immediate results where you can see your photo seconds after taking it, easy and fast multiple frame shooting, and no cost by ruining a roll of film or wasting it on bad photos.) If you buy a traditional SLR 35mm camera, I'd go for something like the Nikon 35mm F2AS with a 50mm \\\"prime lens\\\", or similar. Here's a photo of one of mine:  Digital SLR's  Digital SLR's, or DSLR's, have been the most popular choice for many years now, they're easy to find used, and they're a good starting point in learning photography. These cameras are basically digital versions of the original SLR camera but offer much more flexibility and many more options. Whagt we're seeing right now, however, is a switch from DSLR's to \\\"mirrorless cameras\\\", including the very popular \\\"Micro Four Thirds\\\" cameras which use a smaller sensor, yet often outperform the DSLR's. I'll touch on those, below. Anyway, an inexpensive or used DSLR is a good choice for starting out and I'd recommend an entry level Canon DSLR such as one of the \\\"Rebel\\\" series cameras. I currently use a Canon 1DX which is NOT a beginner's camera, and my old Canon 5D Mark II (this is a great beginner's camera, easy to find, and inexpensive.) Here's a photo of the Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm prime lens attached:  Mirrorless Cameras  These cameras really are \\\"the future of photography\\\" although many professional photographers would scoff at you for even suggesting such a thing because just as it was when SLR's were phasing out, DSLR using pro's often get stuck in their ways and refuse to move with the times. Even today there are professional photographers who refuse to switch from SLR to DSLR! Mirrorless cameras are superior to DSLR's in almost every way: They have higher resolution (megapixels) for a fraction of the cost of DSLR's; there's no mirror flapping around making noise and causing camera vibration; they're smaller and easier to carry, many can shoot 4K and even Cinema 4K video (while Canon and Nikon refuse to adapt and offer this feature for a reasonable price in their DSLR's); and overall, they're less expensive. If you can afford one (they're often cheaper than many new DSLR's), go for it! I currently shoot with a Panasonic Lumix GH4 because I shoot photography AND I need to shoot 4K video and this camera does both. An even less expensive alternative is the Lumix GH3 which sells for around $500, a quarter of the price of the GH4. Here's a photo of the Lumix GH4, a \\\"mirrorless camera\\\":  Regardless of what you choose, unless it's a cheap $30 point-and-shoot or your phone's camera, try to make a decision on which camera format you want to grow into, otherwise you'll be wasting money on a camera and the expensive lenses that you'll end up not using when you switch to a different format.  Taking an introductory photography class or workshop is also a good idea when getting started as you'll more quickly learn the basics including aperture, exposure, shutter speed, composition, and editing. Good luck with your search and your journey into photography!"}, {"upvote": 4, "content": "Any camera with interchangable lenses will work. The T6 might be basic but that does not stop it from taking great pictures.  You have two ways of doing it. Both require a new lens, if all you have is the kit lens. The camera is not the limitation here.  The first is simply with a macro lens. A macro lens is a lens that can focus very closely, so the size of an object is the same size in real life as it is on the sensor on your camera.  Some lenses call themselves macro lenses but really aren't. For example, some cheap 70\\u2013300mm third party lenses call themselves macro lenses, but they are not.  So you need to look for a macro lens with a 1:1 ratio. Not a 1:2 ratio. Snowflakes are really small so you will need something that can really focus closely.  Canon makes some nice inexpensive macro lenses for APS-C - they have a 35mm with image stabilization and a small built in ring light in the front, which runs for about $300usd, and a 60mm without stabilization.  They also make a 100mm and a high end 100mm L with stabilization too.  With macro lenses the longer focal length will not affect the magnification. It will affect the working distance from the subject. That 35mm needs to be really close to the subject to focus on it, whereas the 100mm lenses need to be used further back. What is better depends on what your comfortable with, but on APS-C cameras, 60mm is about the typical focal length people use.  There are also good third party lenses from Sigma and Tamron.  All those macro lenses will work great even for focusing on things at normal distances.  There are some options with higher magnification than 1:1 - Mitakon makes a manual focus 20mm lens that has a 4\\u20134.5x maximum. But it is macro only. It isn't a general purpose lens, and it's almost like a microscope that you need to get extremely close to the subject with. This causes some complications with lighting, and if your subject is too big, the lens will not be able to focus far enough away to make it work.  Your other option is much more difficult to use in practice, but is also cheaper. If you buy a 50mm lens - you could buy the Canon, or you could literally buy any old 50mm lens (even a Pentax lens from the 1970s!), and then get a reversing ring to stick it on the front of your kit lens backwards. That will act like a super macro lens. But you can't really focus with it. This sort of setup can make some amazing images but it is quite difficult to use it well.  If you have any other questions or desire some clarification let me know and I'll point you to it"}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/I-am-using-a-Canon-EOS-550D-now-I-want-to-upgrade-to-a-better-one-Which-Canon-DSLR-would-you-recommend", "question": "I am using a Canon EOS 550D now I want to upgrade to a better one Which Canon DSLR would you recommend", "answers": [{"upvote": 3, "content": "Here you have a convenient timeline of Canon EOS digital DSLRs: Template:Canon EOS digital cameras [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Canon_EOS_digital_cameras ]  As you can see, the 550D was launched in 2010, and is still a good choice as a entry-level camera, except you can'f find it new.

Hobbyists and enthusiasts are more likely to photograph a wider range of subject matter than professionals, who typically focus on one or two genres.

That might be an ultra-wide zoom for landscape or interior use, a portrait lens, a large aperture replacement for your current mid-range zoom, or a large aperture normal prime.    A second type of upgrade is add a camera body to your kit. It's not always practical to carry around a full blown dslr for walks with dog or an all day excursion with your family.  Adding a high-end compact camera (e.g., Sony RX100iv, or Fuji X100T, can open new opportunities.

Similar to how your mouth is shaped when you say the vowel \\uc624 (like holding a large bubble in your mouth) but instead of curving your lips into an \\u3147, just relax them while they're open, letting out the sound. This should feel different from \\uc544, as it is a more contained sound, as in, the sound should feel like it only goes about a centimeter from your mouth, unlike the \\uc544, which goes about a foot.  \\uc73c \\u2013 I think this is fairly easily explained. It's like the oo in good but with a slight sideways pull of your lips. Your teeth shouldn't be touching, but they should be fairly close to doing so. Good is pronounced with \\u3147 shaped lips, but \\uc73c should be with either slightly sideways pulled or relaxed lips. Don't pull too much, though.  \\uc560/\\uc5d0 \\u2013 Like a few have said before, these two have merged into the same sound. If you know how to speak Spanish or Italian without a weird American accent, this is the sound of e, as in de or perro. However, in Korean it is pronounced with less pulled sideways lips and instead a more relaxed mouth. Your mouth should be more open than when you say \\uc73c but not too wide.  Examples:  Please, if you are trying to learn proper Korean, don't take rappers as good examples! They usually try to \\\"westernize\\\" or \\\"bend\\\" their vowels so that they sound hip-hoppy or cool, and their grammar is not good. G-Dragon, for example, in his \\\"Who You\\\" skips whole syllables and totals his Korean pronunciation.   If you need a good example of clear speaking, go with my good ol' \\uc2e0\\uc2b9\\ud6c8.

I only figured it out myself after a lot of practice and exposure to Korean speakers, and I'm not sure I know how to describe the differences to anyone else.  There's practically no difference between \\u3150 and \\u3154 in Korean. The younger generation seems to have completely merged them, and even the older generation merged them in unstressed syllables. Technically, they're both unrounded front mid vowels, but\\u3154 should be somewhat higher than \\u3150. It's basically the same as the difference between eh and \\u00e4h in German or \\u00e9 and \\u00e8 in French.  Now, regarding the difference between \\u3153 and \\u3161, that depends on whether you want a more northern or southern accent. In the Southeast, around Busan, you don't have to worry about distinguishing them, because the vowels have merged in that dialect, into a single central neutral vowel, like the short neutral vowel in the English words gum or love. In the Northwest, that is, in Seoul and its suburbs, \\u3153 has been lowered, backed, and rounded to something similar to \\u3157 but lower and weaker, while \\u3161 is a high center or back unrounded vowel.   There's no real equivalent of \\u3161 in English, but it's sort of like oo as in toot but with your lips relaxed, or like u in up with your jaw relatively closed. I find the best way to pronounce \\u3161 is to just sort of ignore it or think of it as a minimal release of the preceding consonant, like when you're trying to demonstrate to someone a consonant sound but you just can't help but add a vowel afterwards. That is, the way the French knights pronounce \\\"knights\\\" in Monty Python and the Holy Grail would be \\ud06c\\ub2c8\\uadf8\\uce20, in Hangul, the Korean writing system.  Of course, in between Seoul and Busan, or in the Northeast or the Southwest, there are other pronunciations possible. It's been too long since I've looked into Korean dialects to give details of the other areas, but as I recall, the general idea is that the farther south you go, the similar \\u3153 and \\u3161 sound, and the farther north you go, the more different they are."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "My impression just based on what I've read about recent trends is:  \\uc5b4 in recent Seoul pronunciation is just schwa, not \\\"aw\\\" \\uc73c is like English short i as in \\\"bit\\\" \\uc560 in recent Seoul pronunciation, ae and e are identical"}, {"upvote": 6, "content": "Thanks for the a2a!

Now you have real choices Canon makes 4 lenses in this range the F4 and the F2.8, both with IS and No IS I've owned the F4 non IS and the F2.8IS Now the F2.8IS is a NICE NICE lens, great subject isolation at 2.8, but it has two issue - it is the most expensive of the four at $1900, but possibly more importantly, it is HEAVY HEAVY. it doesn't sound like much, but it is 3.28 lbs. At the end of a long day of shooting, it gets heavy. Giving up the IS saves you about $650, but if you intend to hand hold this beast, I don't think it is worth it  The F4 versions are sweet, and I gave mine to my god son so long as I could borrow it back. It is just as sharp, but of course you can't get the same level of isolation. It has 2 HUGE advantages The NON IS version is $600. The IS is $1100 and the other, and why I have borrowed the F4 back when I KNOW I don't need the subject isolation - it weighs in at 1.55 lbs. Yes, it weighs 1/2 as much as the 2.8. If you are stuffing it in your bag, and walking around the city all day, it is a LOT less weight  Beyong that, you are hoing into EF-S lenses, which only one of my cameras can use, and the 300, which I haven't used, or much shorter lenses"}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "What you buy depends on your budget and your requirements  I have 2 super-telephoto lenses:  Canon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS II [ https://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Canon-EF-70-300mm-f-4-5.6-IS-II-USM-Lens.aspx ] ($499)  One of the things I love about this lens is the autofocus speed - virtually instantaneous.

Long lenses start out pricey and go up from there, so you need to consider how much you're willing to spend.  In some cases, you might save some money buying used or refurbished lenses.  * Intend usage.  Some applications need long *and* fast, which gets really expensive, while others might be able to get away with something like a variable aperture f/4-6.3 sort of lens.  Both Tamron and Sigma have brand-new designs in a 150-600mm range, and both are very good for their respective prices.  * Focal lengths of your other lenses.  Ideally, you'd like to have a near-continuous overlapping range of lenses, so you want to consider where a long zoom fits in with the rest of your collection.  * Weight.  The other big drawback of fast long zooms is weight -- all that glass can get heavy to carry.  Sigma's 120-300 f/2.8, for instance, is a wonderful fast zoom, but it's *big* and *heavy* -- on the order of twice as much to carry as something like Canon's 100-400 f/4-5.6.  If you absolutely need the fast aperture, you'll have to go big, but give thought to all that weight.

If you might move to a full frame camera in the future you might want to consider a full-frame lens for its higher build and image quality (for a higher cost).  In the full-frame line and without getting into a super-telephoto lens one of the best lenses you might consider is the Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II USM Lens (Review:  http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Canon-EF-70-200mm-f-2.8-L-IS-II-USM-Lens-Review.aspx).  This lens will project a full-size image on your sensor which will be cropped in your camera giving an apparent focal length of 112mm to 320mm.  The build quality is very high, the aperture of f/2.8 is available throughout the range of focal lengths and the image quality is very high plus it can move with you to a full-frame camera and it has a higher resale value.

If you intend to pursue photography further, and invest later on on a better camera. Then invest on a good lens.

In my opinion if you have a choice, you should never buy either a 18\\u201355mm or 55\\u2013250mm lens. Both are still in the market just because they bring the cost of a DSLR lower.  18\\u2013200mm is a good option, but 18\\u2013135mm produces comparatively sharper images.

Don't buy Tamron if you are an impatient person, focusing is very slow on Tamron.

These lenses are basically used in capturing landscapes.   * Normal lenses: These lenses have focal length ranging from 35 mm to 70 mm. These lenses are used in portraits taken in enclosed areas and can be used as a daily driver for point and shoot. Macro lenses fall under this as a subcategory which are used to capture tiny objects, insects, abstracts.   * Telephoto lenses: These lenses have focal length greater than 70 mm. These lenses are helpful in capturing wildlife, portraits taken in open area as these require greater sensor to object distance to get object in focus.

Please Note: This is me just telling you about my personal experience so far so good about investing on the only legit cryptocurrency investment platform i have seen online, I am in no way trying to advertise or give you a financial advise on how to spend your money. You can make your research and if you find the platform deem fit then you can go ahead just like i did.  When it was first launched, the price of the EOS cryptocurrency sat at $2.29. However, it then doubled in less than 24 hours, with EOS hitting $5.40.  This hike did not last, however, and the coin soon started falling, breaking one support level after another. EOS found its bottom at $0.59, which is where it remained until late October 2017. Once the crypto bull run that marked the year reached its peak, EOS joined the rally, and it skyrocketed to $16.39 on January 13, 2018.  However, while most coins peaked around this date or earlier, EOS' all-time high came later, in April 2018. In mid-April, the crypto market \\u2013 which had been crashing since January \\u2013 started seeing a new bullish wave. Prices started going up, and many assumed that the so-called 'crypto winter' was over.  These days, we know that the surge in April was only the eye of the storm, as the crash continued as May 2018 arrived. But, for those few weeks, the EOS price jumped once more, breaking its former record, and going up to $22.89. This was the coin's highest price, and it has never reached these highs again, at least so far.  Following this second surge, EOS kept dropping, briefly stopped by support here and there, but eventually, it dropped to its new bottom at $1.86 around December 7, 2018. In 2019, the coin saw gradual growth, although it progressed slowly, and everything it had achieved by mid-2019 was undone in the second half of the year, as it slowly returned to the level where it sat ever since \\u2013 between $2 and $2.8.  The EOS price has fluctuated in this range, except for on three occasions in 2020. The first one was between mid-January and mid-February, when it joined another bull run that took it to $5.35. The second was in August 2020, when it hit $3.7, and the last one is right now, led by Bitcoin (BTC), which is once again approaching its all-time highs at $20,000.  EOS, on the other hand, is as far away from its own record as it can be, hovering around $3.26.  What is happening to EOS these days?  Unfortunately, EOS has not been making headlines in 2020, as the crypto industry is mostly focused on the decentralised finance (DeFi) sector. When DeFi started slowing down, bull runs took over, and most of the attention went to Bitcoin.  However, that does not mean that EOS has been doing nothing. Its developers at Block.one recently announced the EOS Resource Model proposal, and the soon-to-arrive review of various talented organisations that responded to the company's invitation to evaluate their code.  Block.one also recently expressed its pleasure with how Spielworks built a rewards and loyalty platform for gamers using EOSIO.  The company also worked on adding new features to its Training and Certification segment of the blockchain.  And, of course, as a development platform, EOS has also been making moves to attract people to develop new DeFi projects on its network. The network already has quite a few successful projects, although the majority of the developers are still focusing on developing DeFi on Ethereum.  EOS price prediction 2021: what to expect from EOS going forward?  Lastly, we arrive at the most interesting part \\u2014 EOS coin price prediction for 2021 and beyond.  According to TradingBeasts, the EOS price in December 2020 will reach a maximum of $3.4, after which the forecasting service expects it to drop back down to $2.7, on average.  In January 2021, its EOS crypto price prediction shows the coin remaining near this level, at around $2.7, later expecting it to experience a slow but steady rise throughout the year, with the coin having the potential to hit a high of $3.9 next December. The average price of EOS is predicted to reach $4.07 in December 2022, and then $5.03 in December 2023.  Wallet Investor also expects the currency's price to rise in early 2021, although their EOS coin forecast says that the asset will see a price crash in the second half of the year. The event will potentially lead EOS down to $1.2 one year from now.  As for CryptoGround, they have a very bullish EOS prediction. In fact, their EOS forecast claims that the coin will simply keep climbing, with its value reaching $4.17 in six months, $4.7 in one year, and $21.4 by December 2025."}, {"upvote": 4, "content": "Stellar had no ICO.

It all comes down to being permissioned and non-trustless. That leads to the following, insurmountable problems.  1. 1 person is in charge and can change the constitution at will. This wouldn't be so bad in a trustless and permissionless platform, but wreaks havoc in a non trustless and permissioned platform. Also if it were several people in charge that have to write a constitution, it's even worse, because writing a constitution with many people is always victim of special interests, lobbying and the like. 2. A design that doesn't prevent cartel formation. Cartels always happen if it is possible. 3.

Do not get this line of thinking stuck in your head because it's not entirely true. In fact, to be honest, this statement is used many times by people who simply can't afford good gear and are jealous at those who can. If you can't afford good gear right now, that's fine; work with what you can afford and save up money to grow into better gear over time. The best camera is always the one you have with you and by this I mean, if you own a $6,500 Canon 1DX and it's sitting at home, your best camera may be the free one that came built into the phone in your pocket!  While it is true, skill is the most important aspect of almost anything, including photography, your gear and even more specifically, your lenses, are just as important. A good lens on an inexpensive camera is always better than a cheap lens on an expensive camera. If you're just starting out and looking for a camera for a beginner, try to think about what sort of photography you'll be doing. General photography such as family photos, photos of your friends, pets, etc.; landscape photography; wildlife photography; street photography, etc. If you don't know yet, that's okay but if you have a goal of developing skills specific to one of these styles, it will help with camera selection.  When getting started, I'd get something inexpensive but not so cheap that your photo quality ends up discouraging you altogether (again, this is where the \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" nonsense kicks in.) I'll cover a couple types and why they're good starter cameras. And with any camera you choose, always try to keep the camera out of \\\"automatic mode\\\" if possible so you begin to master the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  Point-and-Shoot or Camera Phone  These cameras are very inexpensive and with the newer smartphones, the camera is built right in and often takes better photos than the DSLR's from just a few years ago! This is the most inexpensive route to take (and may not cost a penny if you use the camera on your phone) and it helps you learn about composition, lighting, etc. If you're already past this point and want a camera you can grow into, the following are good options:  Traditional SLR's  I know, this is probably not what most people think of when deciding on a beginner's camera but I want to mention it because if you have one of these lying around in your house (parent's or grandparent's old camera, etc.), they're great for learning the basics of a camera with all of the digital stuff removed. SLR (single lens reflex) cameras aren't used much anymore because of the cost of operation, decreased photo quality, and lack of film processing labs, however, I think any aspiring photographer should own or at least use one because they are the \\\"original camera\\\", they are inexpensive, and they help give you a greater appreciation for the luxury of digital photography (not limited to 24-36 photos per roll, immediate results where you can see your photo seconds after taking it, easy and fast multiple frame shooting, and no cost by ruining a roll of film or wasting it on bad photos.) If you buy a traditional SLR 35mm camera, I'd go for something like the Nikon 35mm F2AS with a 50mm \\\"prime lens\\\", or similar. Here's a photo of one of mine:  Digital SLR's  Digital SLR's, or DSLR's, have been the most popular choice for many years now, they're easy to find used, and they're a good starting point in learning photography. These cameras are basically digital versions of the original SLR camera but offer much more flexibility and many more options. Whagt we're seeing right now, however, is a switch from DSLR's to \\\"mirrorless cameras\\\", including the very popular \\\"Micro Four Thirds\\\" cameras which use a smaller sensor, yet often outperform the DSLR's. I'll touch on those, below. Anyway, an inexpensive or used DSLR is a good choice for starting out and I'd recommend an entry level Canon DSLR such as one of the \\\"Rebel\\\" series cameras. I currently use a Canon 1DX which is NOT a beginner's camera, and my old Canon 5D Mark II (this is a great beginner's camera, easy to find, and inexpensive.) Here's a photo of the Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm prime lens attached:  Mirrorless Cameras  These cameras really are \\\"the future of photography\\\" although many professional photographers would scoff at you for even suggesting such a thing because just as it was when SLR's were phasing out, DSLR using pro's often get stuck in their ways and refuse to move with the times. Even today there are professional photographers who refuse to switch from SLR to DSLR! Mirrorless cameras are superior to DSLR's in almost every way: They have higher resolution (megapixels) for a fraction of the cost of DSLR's; there's no mirror flapping around making noise and causing camera vibration; they're smaller and easier to carry, many can shoot 4K and even Cinema 4K video (while Canon and Nikon refuse to adapt and offer this feature for a reasonable price in their DSLR's); and overall, they're less expensive. If you can afford one (they're often cheaper than many new DSLR's), go for it! I currently shoot with a Panasonic Lumix GH4 because I shoot photography AND I need to shoot 4K video and this camera does both. An even less expensive alternative is the Lumix GH3 which sells for around $500, a quarter of the price of the GH4. Here's a photo of the Lumix GH4, a \\\"mirrorless camera\\\":  Regardless of what you choose, unless it's a cheap $30 point-and-shoot or your phone's camera, try to make a decision on which camera format you want to grow into, otherwise you'll be wasting money on a camera and the expensive lenses that you'll end up not using when you switch to a different format.  Taking an introductory photography class or workshop is also a good idea when getting started as you'll more quickly learn the basics including aperture, exposure, shutter speed, composition, and editing.

Narcissists can't answer the questions \\u2018objectively.'  The test that can deliver a diagnosis of NPD is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2). The MMPI-2 also picks up on trauma and other issues and does not always deliver a diagnosis because one is not always applicable.  It has hundreds of questions, answers are compared to how people tend to answer. The final report provides info like people who answered similarly: info here about the characteristics and thinking of this group. And when applicable a diagnosis is delivered.  A person with Narcissistic Personality Disorder has distorted thinking patterns. As the disordered person, whether is be NPD or ASPD, BPD, etc, attempts to answer the questions in a way that will show them in a positive light they tell on themselves and the test catches that.  I know someone who took the test who is either NPD or ASPD (sociopath) and while the diagnosis was not revealed the characteristics were shared and they were disturbing. These people are very different in their thinking.  Imagine, if you will, a movie and our lead character is investigating an international spy ring which includes murders. Imagine this investigator's every moment: strategy; high vigilance of their surroundings; mind always racing; everything they do or say is in their pursuit; how they move about a city; they may buy a home or car for their pursuit; go to certain restaurants; or, befriend certain people. Their every move is due to their role as the investigator. Or imagine if they were one of the devious spies and the same applies; everything they do is in pursuit of their grift.  That is how a Narcissist operates. Every move. Every word. It is all done for their main goal; the everyday, high-vigilance scam on all around them. While they realize that the rest of us aren't like that and they exploit us through that weakness, what they are cursed with is not knowing the beauty of being authentic. And that inauthenticity, which is possible because of their low empathy, is what precludes them from being able to love as we know it.  Perhaps a test may miss a diagnosis but it is doubtful that someone with NPD specifically could fake it. Perhaps someone with ASPD could.  Take the test. Ask people who love you. Look at your history. Have you stolen from people? Do you cheat in relationships?

I am in recovery from a 20+ year psychologically abusive marriage and relationship with a narcissist.  It has been THE core \\u2018romantic' relationship in my life. It's taken 4 years concerted effort after 15 of misery to finally to escape.  The core problem - as most survivors will know - is handling the issue of gaslighting. To say I was prone to being on the receiving end of this is an understatement. My mother was committed to electric shock therapy after a psychotic break when I was 13. This set the stage for an internal fear and narrative that I would eventually \\u2018go mad'.  Fast forward to my marriage. I paired up with a man who had no problems questioning my sanity. The truth is the least sane decision I made was going against some fairly powerful intuition and advice and marrying him.  He was charming. There was extreme \\u2018love-bombing' - jewellery, gifts, expensive holidays - and the ever-present carrot of a romantic fantasy future. I felt so lucky. I loved him with every fibre of my being. Little by little it became sort-of clear that none of it was real. All the trappings came at a cost. I was alone. One of his favourite phrases was \\u2018Treat them mean to keep them keen.' Women were described as \\u2018chikkie babes' and \\u2018miracle bunnies'.  I was an object, not a beloved partner. So were our children.  The deal was \\u2018do what I want and you get stuff (but not love)'.  \\u2018Don't comply and you'll be labelled as defective, abandoned, ridiculed and ultimately discarded.' I wanted him to love and cherish me.  The stuff never mattered.  The hardest thing to handle is that this kind of abuse is subtle like smoke.  I couldn't grasp onto it. It was a pervasive feeling that something was wrong. There were words, phrases, and behaviours that felt and looked plain wrong. And they were peppered with fantasy love phrases and messages of hope.   I found myself simultaneously trying to get out and wanting to win him back.  I flip-flopped. I was never in balance. I was accused of inconsistency, madness, and abusing him by not being able to stick to a plan; then of trying to \\u2018suck him back in' (to my madness).  The truth is the survivor in me knew I had to get out. And the woman in me who wanted his love had to stay. She was convinced he loved her and that she just had to \\u2018shape up'. She needed to \\u2018do better', love more, give more and heal her narcissism to be acceptable.  What \\u2018looked wrong'? It's all there in the rear-view\\u2026  In 2004, I (somehow) integrated the 6-month abandonment of me and our children (then under the age of 2) while I had post-natal depression and our son was ill. His because his family of origin was \\u2018more important'.  I accepted the blame for not supporting him when I was called to account.  In 2010, I handled him being absent for 6 months while he sold a business.  We joined him in Australia because I feared he was never coming back. OUr kids were 6 and 8. He took their our children's passports and filed them with an Australian lawyer to prevent us returning home from after the sale. Apparently I had threatened to abduct our children (back home to the UK).  (I actually suggested he stay on as long as he needed to to be with his family while I got the kids back into school.)  In 2011, he insisted on the addition of court orders to our marriage after this before we were \\u2018allowed' to return home. The orders enabled him to take our children back to Australia without me if I didn't comply and permanently relocate. He kept these in place for 2 years. When he removed them - the day they were due to incept - he expected an immediate thank you and move. I was again the abuser - I \\u2018forced him to put the orders in place'.  In October 2015, he went to Australia for a \\u2018holiday' This turned into a 3-month separation. He spent that Christmas and New Year in Australia with his \\u2018family' because he was \\u2018homesick'. Meanwhile, I stayed in the UK while our children while our daughter prepped for January entrance exams (in the UK and Australia). On New Year's Eve, I found out he'd started an affair 48 hours after landing in Australia. I discovered he'd replicated every detail of our love-bombing with her. That year she got the same Christmas presents as I did. When I discovered the affair - he was clumsy at hiding things - he told me we'd been \\u2018on a break'. To this day it was not an affair. When I confronted him with hard evidence after months of lying he said: You need to figure out why that happened. No apology.  I clearly deserved what I got because I was a narcissist.  In 2018, he relocated to Australia permanently while our daughter was doing her GCSEs. He expected us to have a long-distance relationship or for me to rip the kids out of school and follow him. He chooses to pop over for school holidays for the minimum time possible while accusing me of \\u2018kidnapping his children'. I've been repeatedly told to move if I want our relationship to work. Apparently \\u2018kids bounce back'. I'm failing as a parent and leader by not making them move. They are 16 and 17, settled, navigating GCSEs and A-Levels and do not want to move. Please be clear - he didn't really leave - it's my choice to stay (this abducting our children).  Again, it's my failing - as a narcissist. That's what we do\\u2026  I have chosen to support our children to stay in school where they choose, with their friends and to provide continuity. Professionally this doesn't suit me and I means my career is compromised. I have chosen not to leave my 90-year-old mother alone. As I write this she's in hospital on the way out.  She fell in our house last weekend had a significant bleed to the brain.  She's in decline. He was here when it happened (for 10 days over Christmas). He chose not to see her or say goodbye (after ~23 years).  He was eager - I suspect to get back to his new supply in Australia - to leave.  Our divorce papers aren't through\\u2026yet. It's a matter of weeks.  2016\\u20132020. I am almost at the end of 4 years trying to extricate myself and gain financial support from this marriage. I have retrained and restarted a new career to supplement maintenance. He won't commit any support for our children through college. He runs a private equity fund in Australia. In settlement, I asked for a 50:50 split from the start.  He lied repeatedly about our (his) assets - nearly all are in his name. My lawyer suggested I fight for more. After decades with this man, I knew that the legal and mental fight needed would never result in equality or fairness.  And I would be emotionally minced and stressed in the process. Cutting losses is healthier. It's just stuff in the long run.  He repeatedly avoided filing his papers and managed to negate two (expensive) financial dispute resolution meetings and blame me.  I was accused of slowing the process down. He held off his final filing so that he could sell a hotel and transfer the funds to Australia without disclosing it. I discovered the sale by accident. In 2017, I allowed him to talk me into stopping the process only to find myself living in a shell of a relationship and treading on eggshells while he dropped in and out of our lives.  Through all of this, the thing that kept me stuck was being accused of being a manipulative narcissist. When he first said this, I immediately sought professional help (to cure my narcissism). I had to be a good enough mother. My 1st counsellor laughed like a drain. Did I want the good news or the bad news? Good - You're 100% not a narcissist.. Bad - You're very likely married to one. That was my first clue \\u2014 that I immediately discounted. I have still failed to find a counsellor that can take me seriously on this. It's taken 10 years to work through it. I watch my \\u2018madness' levels every day.  I still question myself. I've done every single online narcissism and sociopathy quiz I can find. I live in perpetual fear that it IS me, that I am deluded (one of his favourite phrases) and actually mad. While I still score next to nothing on any scale I question whether I'm just gaming the quizzes somehow. I second guess my motivations and sanity a lot. I have learned to gaslight myself.  How have I survived mentally? How have our children come out OK - with good grades in school, balanced and apparently stable (after living with a madwoman and narcissist)?  I have an extraordinary support team. From a tight group of no-bullshit friends who've chosen to support me (and not to dis him) through my recovery. I've had a great series of counsellors and coaches, a friendly GP and latterly found an increasing faith in myself, the world and what's possible.  Every day is another painful step towards an increased period of no contact. Because yes - I did beg him to come back repeatedly - in service of being around for his kids and because I loved him. This makes me a narcissist because this is some kind of manipulation to \\u2018drag him back into my vortex.'  Gaslighting is a terrifying experience.  If any of this resonates for you \\u2014 all I can say is this: find people who REALLY see you. Share your fears with them and ask for help. Do not be afraid if you think you're mad - confront this because it's the biggest sign you're in an abusive relationship. And if anyone tells you you're a narcissist and it terrifies you to your core, you worry and believe them, feel like nothing, and are afraid or question yourself fearfully, take courage.  It's not you, it's them. Narcissists never question themselves.  They are ALWAYS right.  Get out whatever it takes. Take what you can. You can always rebuild. Your sanity is more precious than any \\u2018stuff' or fantasy promises.  Walk and keep walking. One day at a time.

However, since you have asked this question, here is what comes to my mind:  1. Remember that the odds of getting into a top Civil Service (IAS/IPS/IFS) are probably 200\\u2013300 out of 10 lacs. While we all talk about the big successes, there are 100 times more candidates who don't make it despite being very capable and working very hard. 2.  1. In my own batch at IIT there was a guy much smarter than me, who was academically brilliant. He never made it even to the interview stage, if I remember correctly. 2. It does not mean that you can't beat the odds but keep that perspective and know what you are up against.  3. Decide how many years you want to give to the exam. Even though many people have spent 3\\u20135 years, I am reluctant to suggest that one should spend that much time. Give it a year or two, and then give it your best shot. 4. If you are writing the exam, go all out, day and night. It should be a total war, not a skirmish. You should be able to put in 10\\u201312 hrs a day with intense focus, if not more. Though I am talking about number of hours, remember that the quality of effort is more important. 5. Hard work is not enough - you need to know how to prepare the fastest for each topic/subject. In our days at IIT Kanpur, we used to get very good info about which topic to prepare from which book from previous year's candidates. IITK used to produce many toppers and they had figured out a lot of things over time. It made the preparation very efficient. I suspect it must be much easier now due to organized coaching etc. 6. It is a long exhausting journey. Unless you are personally super-motivated, don't do it due to social or family pressure. At some point the only thing that will drive you is the fire burning inside you. I will skip any specific advice on which subject to take or which study material to use. I am sure there are people much better qualified than me to do that.  All I can say is that nothing is easy, but everything is doable. Good luck."}, {"upvote": 8315, "content": "I will share my story and the strategy that I followed to clear the coveted Civil Services Exam in the first attempt.  First of all, let me tell you a bit about myself. Civil services was never childhood dream. I did not start preparing from my school days and if anyone tells you that you need to start preparing from 8th standard, it is a myth and do not take them at face value.  I did my B.Tech from College of Engineering, Trivandrum in Kerala. After graduating in 2015 I was working with ITC Limited, as a mechanical engineer. It was during my stint at ITC that I decided to prepare. So, I put in my papers in the June of 2016 and started preparing from July 2016.  Term of preparation:- I started my preps from July 2016 and wrote Prelims in June 2017. So that is a total of 11 months of focused preparation before appearing for CSE 2017.  So let me now come to the topic of how to crack civil services in the first attempt.  These are some prerequisites that anyone should have before starting their preparation.  1. Unflinching self belief:- No one in the world is going to believe in you and your capabilities. And every tom, dick and harry will not miss any opportunity to question your abilities and to blame you for every decision. So you of all people should believe in you, without that kind of confidence in yourself, seeing through this exam would become a Herculean task. 2. Having an original plan/strategy:- Before I started my preparation for civil services, I had gone through strategies of many toppers. What I found out was that no two people had cleared this exam with the same strategy, but the common factor that runs through all those toppers were that they had their own strategies. Now that is rule number one. Do not blindly follow the strategy shown to you by a coaching institute or any topper, you need to have your own plan which magnifies your strong points and diminishes your weaknesses. 3. Be tougher than the exam:- The civil services exam is dubiously dubbed as the toughest exam in the world. So to master the exam you need to tougher than it. You need to be prepared to face failures and get up and fight back stronger. 4. Know your syllabus:- The most common mistake that most aspirants make is that they fail to go through the syllabus for the exam. Knowing what the syllabus demands and not demands is absolutely necessary fpr clearing this exam. Only then will we be able to target our efforts for quick results. Merely pouring through volumes and volumes of history and geography is not what the exam demands. there is a very highly defined syllabus and our effort should be to cover as much of the syllabus with as much clarity as possible. 5. It is breadth that matters and not depth:- The Civil Services Exam is an examination to recruit generalist bureaucrats who would be able to handle any department under the government. The exam, therefore, demands the exact same thing, your vastness and breadth of understanding matters and not depth of understanding in any subject. A common mistake that I have seen aspirants make is that they try to cover a subject from cover to cover and in the end amassing as much knowledge in the subject as a PhD holder in that subject would have. Whereas the exam demands a mere fraction of that knowledge. Should one attend a coaching class to clear Civil Service Exam?  This is perhaps the first decision any civil service aspirant will have to make before starting your preparation. Now this is highly subjective. Given the huge amount of online content that is available now-a-days it is perfectly possible to clear the CSE without joining any coaching institute.  But I had enrolled at a coaching centre in Kerala. I did so because, at the start of my preparation I had absolutely no idea about the exam or how to prepare for the same. So for me some amount of guidance and handholding was necessary for me.  Now I should add a word of caution here. Even if a candidate decides to join some coaching class there is only so much classes can do (at best say 20\\u201330% of the work might get done in a classroom), it will entirely depend on how much effort that you put in that will decide your result.  What books should I read?  This is again a very subjective topic and there is not a single comprehensive book list that will help you clear this exam.  NCERT Text books of history, geography, economics and polity from class Vi to XII are a must read in my opinion. Reading these books will help you cover and basics and create a strong foundation which you can supplement with your further reading. Personally almost 60% of my knowledge base for the static subjects come from NCERT text books.  Below is a list of books that I followed for my preparation.  The key here is to select the books you are comfortable with and to stick with them. Reading all the material that comes out daily is both impractical and unfruitful. Reading the same texts multiple times will be much more beneficial.  How important is newspaper reading?  Newspapers are vital for any preparation strategy. I used to spend atleast 2\\u20133 hours daily reading the newspaper. It helps one cement the concepts and helps you evolve opinions and will help you analyse a given situation from multiple perspectives. This will come in handy especially during mains and interview stages.  I used to prepare notes from The Hindu daily on the evernote app. This helped me stay organised. During the last 2 months of prelims preparation, I further reduced my one year worth of newspaper notes into crisp notes that filled one 100 page notebook. I read this condensed version multiple times and was the major source for current affairs preparation for prelims as well as mains.  How important is mock exams?  Mocks tests are very very very very very important in all the three stages of the exam. I cannot stress the importance of mock tests any more.  For Prelims, giving lot of mock tests will help you refine your strategy to maximise your scoring. For some answering only those questions which they are absolutely sure of will do the trick. Whereas for someone else (like me) maximizing the number of attempts may help clear the cut off. And there is only one way to find out the strategy that will work for you, do umpteen number of mock exams.  Perhaps, mock tests for mains are the most important. In mains it is not how much you know that matters, but how well you can articulate the things that you know in the limited time that is available. Mains answer writing is a skill, which can be mastered only with practice.  Choosing the right optional subject  The optional paper can make or break your career. So be very careful in choosing your optional. Your criteria while choosing the optional should be  1. Do you like the subject, enough to spend thousands of hours pouring over it. 2. Is there good guidance available for the subject. Especially are there good mock tests with good feedback available for the chosen subject. 3. Also check the trend of past few years and check the scoring trend. However this should be the last consideration and the primary consideration should be for your passion for the subject. Pacing your preparation:-  It is of utmost importance to rightly pace your preparation so that you never run out of steam. One must start slowly, but steadily build up momentum so that he/she can give the final push close to the examination.  But the most important aspect to clearing this exam is to enjoy the journey and not just the destination. One must thoroughly enjoy the preparation phase to be able to bear with the stress that this exam puts on an aspirant. Take it one day at a time, enjoying the learning process and you are sure to succeed.  All the very best!!"}, {"upvote": 650, "content": "Always stay optimistic.

EOS and NEO are extremely centralized with only 21 consensus nodes and handpicked nodes for NEO, while Cardano and Elastos are near infinitely decentralized through side-chains/off-chain/horizontal scaling.  This is the one big difference that decides everything, because anyone can build a centralized, highly scalable platform. You just pick a normal database and build on it. There is no challenge in that. The huge difficulty is decentralizing it.  Cardano and Elastos have managed to achieve that, EOS has not and its design prevents it from decentralizing in the future.  Between Cardano and Elastos, they are very similar in scalability and decentralization, however Elastos, which is even more comprehensive and efficient than Cardano as a dapps platform.  So, it looks like Elastos is currently the best platform to dethrone Ethereum. However, Ethereum will roll out changes to their platform that makes it more scalable with Raiden Network and Casper.

EOS - dPOS (initially thousands of tx/sec but looking at implementing parallel computing scaling to millions tx/sec). NEO, ICX and EOS all utilise nodes to process tx making them more 'centralised' but when compared to PoW and mining pools they are definitely more decentralised.  Smart contracts are used by all.  The biggest problem with ETH and NEO would be that to transact with the block chain a user will require the appropriate coins to pay per interaction (gas). This will prevent usage of the platforms by the general population. NEO has solved the scaling issue but is still rather centralised with the amount of nodes (with plans to increase the amount of nodes), while ETH has yet to see results with plasma, sharding and casper.  From what I understand, ICON will require ICX to pay for interoperability between block chains but within the individual blockchains themselves (theloop blockchain for banks, universities etc.), I don't think it will be required so this will allow greater user uptake.  EOS will be a rival to ICON in my opinion. There are no transaction fees as the EOS staked pays for the network capacity dependent on the percentage of EOS staked compared to entire eosio network e.g. I lock up 10 mil EOS tokens to have 1% network capacity to utilise for transactions - that is if all 1 billion tokens are staked.

First of all, both are decentralized ledgers and smart contract platforms implemented on top of a blockchain. In that respect they are very similar. Our differences fall in four categories: governance, smart-contracts, consensus, and general philosophy.  1. Governance  Ethereum demarked itself from Bitcoin by its low reluctance to hardfork in order to upgrade its network or correct perceived issues with its operations. Tezos shares Ethereum's point of view on the importance of keeping the protocol dynamic and evolving but we take a different approach. In Tezos, protocol upgrades are formally proposed on the blockchain and voted upon by the stakeholders according to preset governance rules. If the proposal is adopted, the proposal is compiled and automatically moves on to the Tezos testnet. After a period of testing, a confirmation vote is held and if successful the testnet is automatically promoted to the main network. This lets us upgrade without having to hard fork. Ethereum considers that it is important to give users the discretion to follow the upgrade or not. We think it's problematic for several reason. Most notably: 2.  1. In such a discretionary choice, users' interest is in following what they perceive as the legitimate choice, not the one they necessarily deem best. This gives, de facto, enormous power to the core development team and the Ethereum foundation. This dynamic is known as a Keynesian beauty contest. 2. As these systems grow, users tend to become more passive members of their community. This makes it harder and harder to muster the amount of coordination required by a hard fork. This creates a bias towards stagnation which may be suboptimal. Some amount of bias towards conservativism in protocol upgrade is desirable, but we would rather have stakeholders chose it explicitly than having it be imposed by external circumstances.  3. Smart-contracts  Like Ethereum, Tezos possesses a rich, Turing complete, smart contract language which can create covenants around its tokens. Ethereum's approach was to build a very low level virtual machine, the EVM, and then to develop high level languages on top of it, the most successful of which is Solidity. We take a different approach. Our base language, Michelson, has both aspects of a low level language: it manipulates a stack, like Bitcoin and doesn't use variables or named functions and aspects of high level language: it is statically typed, purely functional, and offers maps, sets, lists, cryptographic primitives, and arbitrary precision integers out of the box.  Ethereum's EVM attempts to be as neutral and efficient as possible. It is designed to be, as its name implies, a virtual machine. This comes at a cost. The contracts on the Ethereum blockchain are stored as EVM code, which makes them extremely hard to analyze due to the complexity of reasoning about such a low level language. While it is possible to attach Solidity sources, it is not always possible to make sure that the two source code describe exactly the same contract. This is because the Solidity compiler isn't certified. This type of subtleties can create potentially devastating bugs like this one [ https://blog.golemproject.net/how-to-find-10m-by-just-reading-blockchain-6ae9d39fcd95 ].  We took the view that most smart contracts only need to implement very simple business logic. It is far more important for them to be correct than to be extremely efficient. Even if a contract does involve heavy computations, those computations can typically be performed off-chain, leaving the smart-contract to deal only with the relatively lightweight transaction logic.  There are efforts underway to use formal verification to prove properties of Ethereum contracts, but such efforts typically need to overcome large constraints inherent in the design of the EVM or Solidity. Michelson was designed from day 1 to be an easy target for formal verification. 4. Consensus  Tezos is launching with a pure proof-of-stake consensus protocol while Ethereum relies on proof-of-work. While Ethereum does plan to move to proof-of-stake, the two algorithms are qualitatively different.  Ethereum's proposed proof-of-stake algorithm relies on a set of bonded validators to create blocks. These validators earn rewards for the function they perform for the network. These rewards eventually dilute the holdings of other participants.  Tezos' proof-of-stake algorithm is designed so that stakeholders are called upon to create blocks and receive rewards randomly and in proportion to their holdings. This means that even a very small holder can have a chance to create a block and receive a reward. This means that only users who do not participate in the consensus algorithm become diluted, as opposed to almost everyone. 5. General philosophy  Tezos has a few philosophical differences in how it approaches its design. 6.  1. Thin vs Fat protocol, appcoins  Ethereum aims to be a thin protocol layer. A consensus mechanism to power the EVM upon which real applications are built. These applications are then generally expected to issue their own tokens, or appcoins. In contrast, Tezos aims to be a fat protocol layer with many features.  While Tezos does support the creation of appcoins, we do not put any emphasis on them. While these applications can create demand for the underlying token in order to power smart-contract, they also end up diluting it. In many cases, the token is being shoehorned into an application that does not need a separate token nor benefits from one. We do not think this is a sustainable model.  The preferred way for Tezos to gain features is by protocol amendments. For instance, native support of prediction markets can be done at the protocol level. A developer could propose an amendment introducing such support and attach an invoice to the amendment in order to get rewarded if the amendment is selected. 2. Developer community  Ethereum designed Solidity to be similar to JavaScript in order to appeal to a large number of developers. We do not think this approach is a good fit for smart contracts. Smart contracts need to be developed with great care, and their failure can taint the reputation of the platform. It is better to appeal to a moderate number of highly talented programmer than to go for breadth. Many useful applications can be built on top of these ledgers without using smart contracts, and for those applications we have a convenient JSON API.  Overall, one gets the impression that Ethereum tends to see developers as their users, while Tezos is more focused on the end users themselves.

Either way, I'm bullish for both."}, {"upvote": 30, "content": "AFAIK, Ethereum is not adopted at all. I am not aware of any Ethereum dApp that is really working. The only attempt of complex smart contract that we know of was DAO which ended as a triple disaster.  1. DAO had a critical bug that allowed a malicious user to transfer the resources to his own account. This was not a hack though, nor a theft. Everything was done according to the contract. 2. The best Ethereum developers gave up on fixing it, which means that no one can write complex dApps without bugs. 3. The Ethereum community gave up to pressure and rewrote the blockchain. Thus violating the contract and breaking the blockchain immutability. They call such thing a bailout in Wall Street. A few rich investors that entered a contract that exposed them to risk but assumed that there's no risk and when the thing blowed up - saved themselves at expense of everybody else. Needless to say, an Ethereum fork was created - the ETC where the DAO smart contract wasn't rewritten.  The Ethereum idea sounds great when you first hear about it. But after giving it a thought - you can understand that it has severe flaws - as was demonstrated by DAO disaster. The problem with smart contracts - they are supposed to be immutable - thus eliminating the need to trust developers. But, if the contract is immutable - how do you fix the bugs/add new features? You can't. So, the Ethereum blockchain is just a very slow EC2/Google Computing Cloud competitor which allow to host an application in the cloud. This is something. But a lot less than advertised.  But, even if you want to host an immutable program on the blockchain - how do you know it does what it expected to do and only this? For this you need formal validations. Which cannot be done with current Ethereum programming languages or even on current Ethereum VM. They work on these improvements under the umbrella of Casper development - but IMO - this is in the research stage and probably will take years to implement.  The only use of Ethereum for now - as ICO platform. But\\u2026 ICOs are mostly scam and when they will blow up - and most of them will, it will hurt Ethereum. Moreover, Ethereum had network shutdowns during some of the ICOs. The miners used their power to insert their own transactions first into the block in order to buy the coins.  Regarding NEO - I am not familiar with it, but there other coins that allow to write smart contracts in Javascript - like Lisk. This is nothing new. Unless those programming languages allow formal verifications - the platform is broken. I will believe otherwise if someone will refer me to a complex working smart contract that is used by real people to do real stuff every day."}, {"upvote": 9, "content": "You could say it has 1 advantage with more scalability, but at a heavy price, because it chose to be permissioned and non-trustless instead of permissionless and trustless.

It all comes down to being permissioned and non-trustless. That leads to the following, insurmountable problems.  1. 1 person is in charge and can change the constitution at will. This wouldn't be so bad in a trustless and permissionless platform, but wreaks havoc in a non trustless and permissioned platform.

A design that doesn't prevent cartel formation. Cartels always happen if it is possible. 3. If the security of a network relies on 1 person, it can't get mass adoption, because that person has to be perfect. Unfortunately, he isn't perfect, because he has made a very bad constitution.

Will try to give a generalised answer.  General Acceptance: Ethereum better known for its market capitalisation. Means they have more money in circulation. The only coin that beats Ethereum is Bitcoin in this regard. ETH also more well known than EOS. i.e., more places you can trade especially decentralized exchanges. Ethereum also has better wallet support.  Developer Support: Ethereum's developer community is larger than EOS's. There's a vast array of developers available if one wants to develop a dApp. However, the EOS block producers and block producer candidates are (indirectly) incentivized to help the dev community by providing support, tools and sometimes funding. The amount of support for EOS currently is phenomenal.  Smart Contracts: Solidity, the smart contract language for Ethereum is very close to Javscript and is purpose built for smartcontracts. With the Python version [ https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/v0.1.0-beta.10/ ] is out, it will be easier to code. EOS supports Webassembly smartcontracts usually written on C++. Technically you can write the code in any language which can compile into WASM though. There are IDEs [ https://www.eosstudio.io/ ] to help. If you are just starting to code contracts, you would be better off with EOS in my opinion.  Scalability: ETH's blocks are produced in ~15 seconds. EOS block time is ~500milli seconds. If you are developing an app for a consumer, you may find EOS closer fit for real-world scenarios. For a better comparison, EOS supports around 1000 TPS (transactions per second) while ETH is at 15TPS. Currently EOS accounts for 68% [ https://www.blocktivity.info/ ] of the blockchain transactions while ETH has 3%. Please note that this is just a comparison. Why EOS has such a massive share has probably much to do with how transactions are designed in EOS.  Cost: dApps built on ethereum need to spend ETH as Ethereum is proof of work currently. The price volatality of ETH stops one from spending it. The cost of transaction in EOS is adjusted by their inflation model. EOS do not charge a transaction fee. It's closer to how our current internet works. So users will be more inclined to use an EOS dApp in the long run as it is cheaper or free. We are currently starting to see this is the case.  Price stability: EOS/USD price is comparatively stable compared to BTC/USD or ETH/USD. Currently BTC is bullish and many alt coins followed suit while EOS is still $5-$8 rages.  EOS's design is more to do with holding it in your own wallet and using it than trading it on exchanges. With the new REX [ https://eosauthority.com/rex_history/ ] in action you can get \\u2018interest' by holding EOS. It's a reasonable passive income opportunity.  Security & Decentralization: Both, ETH's & EOS' security is provided by the network. ETH is protected by a global set of miners. But a miner with more resources can attach more hashpower and weaken the decentralization aspect of Ethereum. The network or an ETH holder cannot stop this from happening. It's the case with Bitcoin as 60% of the hashpower is controlled by just 5 people. EOS is a democratic system. The chain is protected by 21 voted block producers based on Delegated Proof of Stake [ https://twitter.com/mixdev/status/1143769516461023232 ]. Anyone holding EOS in their wallets can vote. A rogue block producer can be voted out simply by EOS account holders not voting them essentially kicking them out from the network. This will reinstate security of the blockchain. EOS has a potential problem of vote buying and other collusion channels. But the point is, the system has means to prevent or be offensive to those who act against the network; a feature Ethereum does not have.  Sustainability & Energy Efficiency: In a way, EOS is more sustainable than ETH. EOS is 17,236 times [ https://eosauthority.com/green/ ] more energy efficient than Ethereum.  EOS block producers run highly efficient server CPUs compared to high power GPUs or ASICs of ETH mining. This cuts down emissions as well as cost by a large margin.

Canon is using an outdated sensor, and you will get better quality with the Nikon, as well as it will perform better in low light.  With that said, a lot depends on what you are trying to do.  If you will be primarily shooting photos, then I would stick with Nikon.  If you will be primarily shooting video, then Canon is the way to go.  I am thinking of the future here, and since the lenses are what you will keep, and what you spend the most money on....this is a decision that is best made early in the game.

Since you said you are a beginner, get this point straight right at this point because I made this mistake and ended up spending a lot of money and I don't want to see another brother, (or a sister) suffer.  Cameras do only 30% of the work when it comes to taking pictures. The bigger half of the work is done by lenses you use.  For example, I took this picture with the 18-55mm kit lens that I got with my nikon d3300.  Not so great, right? Ok, now I swap my 18-55mm to a 50mm prime.  See the difference? The camera used for both pictures is same but the output has a huge difference just because I swapped the lens.  Nikon, canon, sony are all good. The reason why they are the top brands is because while one company launches a new product, the other is already on it's way doing R&D to make something even better.

You can choose one camera over the other based on resolution, number of focus points, etc, etc, but remember that it is you who will make the camera take the pictures.  Keep shooting, go for the manual mode as early as possible. You will not get good shots to being with, but that should never stop you from taking pictures.

But even so, I don't consider myself to be a professional.  To me, the word professional is very ambiguous. The real meaning of the word \\\"professional\\\" is that you are making a living out of your photography, so in this case the camera must be able to produce photos with image quality that surpass the minimum photo-publishing requirements. In this case, a 700D with its 18MP Canon sensor that's also being used in the 7D meets the requirement, as the image quality produced by the 700D will satisfy at the very least the minimum standard requirement of many photographers; so it's safe to say it's good enough to be considered a \\\"professional camera\\\". A lot of low-budget studios where I live, which I consider to be professional photography studio, even still use the good-old 500D for passport headshots and similar stuffs, and they make money from it; that makes the 500D a \\\"professional camera\\\". I'm pretty sure that the photos from the 700D are also good enough to even get pass the very strict requirement of a lot of professional stock photography agencies. So there's that one kind of professional.    On the other hand, the assumed meaning of the word \\\"professional camera\\\" that the camera manufacturers and marketing departments tried to emphasize to us is the camera with the most feature packed with a very high price-level. Well, in this case, the 700D is not a professional camera, and the manufacturer will push you towards a 7D, 5D or 1D, in hope that you'll buy those products with a much higher margin to both cover the operational cost of the manufacturer and make more profit for the company. They don't care if you make a living out of your camera or not, but the 7D, 6D, 5D, and 1D are professional cameras. That's another kind of professional.  Now let's discuss the 700D specifically. I don't personally own the 700D but I used to own a 650D for one year, and it's spec'ed very similar to the 700D. The 650D/700D can shoot 18MP RAW or JPEG with a CMOS sensor that's very similar to the sensor on the high-end Canon 7D. It does shoot at 4 or 5fps burst image, it shoot 30fps video at 1080p, it has a decent viewfinder, and a good all-around control as well as menu.   Upgrading from a 650D/700D to a 7D, a \\\"professional\\\" camera, will give you faster burst image at 8fps, weather-sealing, better view-finder, more extensive manual control, and a heavier body. But it will not give you a better image quality.   Upgrading to a 5D Mark III will give you a somewhat cleaner image quality at high ISO, better control, better viewfinder, weather-sealing, better video output, but you're back with 5fps burst speed, and you'll have to invest to full-frame lenses.   Upgrading to 1D, you'll get 7D fast-performance with an almost-5D-like image quality, but it'll cost you as much as a used decent car.  Now the important question that you'll have to ask for yourself is: will you make more money if you have a 7D, 6D, 5D, or a 1D? Maybe yes, maybe no. But one thing for sure, you'll have to spend more money to buy those cameras than if you buy the 700D. Can you justify that? Do you really need to have those features on those so-called professional cameras, or can you live with just the features on the 700D?  I personally don't give too much thought about using the so-called professional cameras. As long as I can deliver the results needed by the clients or by yourself, I think I'm happy. My 650D could deliver the result that I require back then, and to my book, it's good enough. I don't know about you, nor do I know about your photography requirement, so I can't speak for you.  To conclude, I quoted a small part of David Thorpe's blog post with the title \\\"Is This Camera Professional\\\". David Thorpe is an ex-photojournalist from UK, a true professional photographer in my opinion. Here's that quote:   %3E When John Downing took the classic picture of a stunned Margaret Thatcher leaving the Imperial hotel in Brighton, England, after the IRA had bombed it, he had been having a drink in the bar.

That's a matter of opinion\\u2014but that doesn't mean the individual camera brands don't have characteristics that may make them more suited to one type of photography or one type of photographer over the other.  When comparing Canon vs. Nikon side-by-side, there are a lot of similarities, like solid image quality and a wide range of accessories, but there's a lot of differences too\\u2014some subtle, others, not so much.  Canon Vs. Nikon: Sensors  Both Canon and Nikon offer cameras powered by similarly sized sensors, but there's a lot more that goes into image quality than just the size of the sensor. Just when one manufacturer seems to leap forward in sensor technology, the other catches up.  Most of Nikon's latest DSLRs use a new sensor design that allows them to eliminate the optical low pass filter without an abundance of moir\\u00e9, or distortion in fine lines and patterns. The filter is one more thing for the light to pass through before hitting the sensor, so eliminating it allows the camera to pick up more details and perform a bit better in low light. All of Nikon's 2015 APS-C sensor cameras don't use an optical low pass filter and a handful of their full frame professional models have eliminated it as well.  Canon's latest DSLRs, on the other hand, seem more focused on the megapixels. Most of Canon's DSLRs still use an optical low pass filter, though there are options like the Canon EOS 5DS R that do without. Their latest big announcements come in the form of full frame DSLRs with a whopping 50 megapixels. While judging a camera on megapixels alone is like judging a book by its cover, the EOS 5DS does capture a 8688 x 5792 resolution, where the Nikon D810 with 36 megapixels captures at most 7360 x 4912. The higher resolution allows for larger prints and more cropping without affecting the image quality.  While the two are focusing on different areas of sensor technology, Canon and Nikon DSLRs both have excellent image quality. That doesn't mean you'll get the exact same image when shot with two different cameras, though. Colors between the two options can be noticeably different, for example. Which one produces better color is a matter of personal preference\\u2014they are simply different, there's no right or wrong answer.  Canon Vs. Nikon: Speed  Canon and Nikon come in pretty even as far as the speed of their autofocus, but there's a subtle difference in their burst speed rates. Speed is hard to come by in DSLRs\\u2014where it's not uncommon to find a mirror-less camera with a 10 fps burst mode, DSLRs have more gear to move to take a picture and it's tougher to reach those high speeds.  Canon tends to have faster high-end DSLRs. The Canon EOS 7D Mark II ($1,799) hits an excellent 10 fps burst rate, making it one of the top DSLRs for sports shooters. Nikon's fastest APS-C camera, on the other hand, is capable of 6 fps, the D7200 ($1,199). Getting even further into the advanced options, Canon's full frame 1D X hits 14 fps, where the similar Nikon D4S gets 11 fps.  When it comes to the entry-level, more budget friendly models, however, Nikon offers more speed. It's usually just by a frame or two though, as when comparing the Nikon D7200's 6-7 fps to the Canon T6S's 5 fps.  Canon Vs. Nikon: Operation  Performance between the two brands is pretty similar, but there are some noticeable differences when it comes to operating each camera. The terminology on a Canon is different from that on a Nikon, for starters. The S on the Nikon's mode dial and the Tv on the Canon both indicate shutter priority mode, for example. Nikon also uses simpler terminology for autofocus modes\\u2014it's a bit simpler to remember what Continuous Autofocus is versus Al Servo Autofocus (they're both the same thing).  There's also often a significant difference in battery life, with Nikons generally able to take more shots on a single charge. For example, the Nikon D7200 has double the battery life of the similarly priced Canon T6S. That's not the case with every model, but, more often than not, Nikons have a better battery rating.  Canon Vs. Nikon: Video Quality  Canon, traditionally, has offered better video quality sooner. They were the first to develop a hybrid autofocus system allowing the camera to refocus while recording. Canon is known for their better autofocus tracking while recording, and they also have a selection of lenses designed specifically for video.  Answering which brand has the better video quality two years ago would have been much simpler. Where a few models ago Nikon didn't offer autofocus while recording video, their latest DSLRs offer continuous autofocus. Comparing models individually across the brands, Nikon even has some cameras with a 60 fps frame rate for smoother motion where the equivalent Canon has 30 fps. Canon traditionally offers the better video, but Nikon's latest developments put them much closer.  Canon Vs. Nikon: Options  When it comes to the more advanced DSLRs, there's pretty much a Canon to match every Nikon. That's not always the case though. Nikon hasn't yet come up with an answer to Canon's speedy 10 fps EOS 7D Mark II, and Nikon has a camera designed specifically for astrophotography, the D810A, where Canon's similar option has a smaller APS-C sensor.  When it comes to entry-level options, however, Canon's selection doesn't quite match up with Nikon's models. There are older Canon DSLRs available for around $500, but the current models (as listed on Canon's website) start at $899 for the body only for the EOS 60D. Nikon's D3300 offers full DSLR capability to beginners for a $650 list price\\u2014and that includes a kit lens. Canon offers a model priced fairly evenly with the enthusiast Nikon D7200, the T6S, but there are some pretty significant differences. The D7200 has no optical low pass filter, 51 autofocus points, 60 fps HD video, 6-7 fps burst shooting and an 1,100 shot battery life. The T6S, by comparison, has an optical low pass filter, 19 focus points, 30 fps HD video, 5 fps burst shots and half the battery life. Where the specs are close in the high-end models, Nikon often offers more in their entry and enthusiast options (though again, that's not always the case).  Canon Vs. Nikon: So which one is best?  Buying a DSLR is a bit different than buying a compact camera, because once you start accumulating lenses, it becomes much more expensive to change brands. Since the two brands operate a little differently (and with different terminology), switching would also mean relearning a few minor things.  So, then, which manufacturer is best? Which camera brand should you choose?  The answer? There isn't a winner\\u2014both Canon and Nikon offer excellent cameras with solid image quality. If one brand offered a better camera every time, the other would've gone out of business a long time ago.  But, that's not to say one brand isn't more suited to one person or the other. Beginners would likely be happy with a DSLR from either system\\u2014but Nikon offers a more affordable option that's still full of features and Nikon's terminology is a bit easier to understand when starting from scratch. Sports photographers can capture the action with a DSLR from either manufacturer\\u2014but Canon tends to offer more speed in their high end models. Quality videos can be shot on both\\u2014but Canon typically has a smoother autofocus and offers lenses specifically for cinema.  When choosing between camera brands, it's best to compare each camera individually\\u2014where Nikon may have a better entry-level DSLR, Canon may have a better DSLR for sports.  When making the choice between Canon vs. Nikon, here are a few things to consider:   * What is the most important thing in a camera to you? Speed? Resolution? Video quality?  * What does the manufacturer offer at your current experience level and for your current budget?  * What does the manufacturer offer that you might be looking to upgrade to in the future? While you probably won't be looking at the same options in five years, if they offer something in that range currently, they're likely to continue to making updates to that line.  * What lenses would you ideally like to add to your kit? Does that manufacturer offer those lenses? Canon or Nikon? Neither one is a bad choice, which means it's not an easy choice."}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/Any-word-of-a-firmware-upgrade-for-the-Canon-EOS-70D", "question": "Any word of a firmware upgrade for the Canon EOS 70D", "answers": [{"upvote": 3, "content": "I am not a Canon guy byt anyways, have you ever heard of magic lantern?

No good photographer worth his salt is going to go cheap on lenses. My advice has always been - spend less on bodies and more on lenses, buy as good lens as possible by making compromise on the body. This is because the difference between an entry-level camera body and the mid-range one are some features which a hobbyist does not really need. For example, there is the all weather sealing feature in mid range DSLRs. This is required by the user who shoots all round the year in places with inclemental weather. This feature jacks up the price of the body by a good $200 or so. The hobbyist does not need it and the money saved should/could be spent on lenses. The photo is 80% the photographer's art and skill and 20% camera work. Out of the 20% camera work, 70\\u201380% is the lens and rest is the body. The lens is the eye of the camera, the camera will capture what the lens transmits - simple rule of garbage in, garbage out.  You have also mentioned almost everything that you would like to shoot, i.e., you want to shoot portraits, landscapes, time lapse, etc. It is not easy to find a good lens that satisfies all situations. There are some all purpose zooms but they are a compromise on quality and very heavy. Buying and pairing them with the likes of Canon 7DM-II or Nikon D610 makes a mockery of the camera.  I would suggest that you look for Canon 700D or Nikon D5500 and start with the kit lens. Kit lens is good for the beginner because it fits most situations.

The answers will come to you automatically."}, {"upvote": 24, "content": "No, not all."}, {"upvote": 16, "content": "It's a decent start, but it also tells you a few things about Canon's thinking right now. And I think they made some good decisions, and a few bad ones that may have not been choices as much as technical limitations.  Neither Canon nor Nikon were actually new to mirrorless with last August's introductions. But the R and the Z are professional formats, even if the first models are not a match for the top-of-the-line DSLRs yet. Both Canon and Nikon took on the idea that mirrorless was something less than DSLR, a step between DSLR and compact digital cameras (aka point and shoot). Nikon's 1 system used the same 1\\u2033 sensor size found in high-end P&S cameras like the Sony RX10 and RX100. But Canon put out a very compact APS-C system with their EOS M. And a funny thing happened: while Nikon's 1 system is now defunct, the EOS M is very popular, albeit not necessarily in the USA. Canon's been the #2 mirrorless brand in Japan in 2016 and 2017 (BCN rankings, second to Olympus) and looks to be taking the #1 spot for the 2018 year\\u2026 without even counting the EOS R. Canon seems to have nailed the consumer mirrorless ILC with the EOS M.  So it should be no surprise that Canon got into mirrorless on a higher level with the EOS R, but then again, it should be. Canon is slower to react to competition than just about anyone. Why this, why now? Canon feels the competition.  For most of history since maybe the 1940s or 1950s, Canon and Nikon had much of the professional market for cameras. In the 1960s, led by Nikon, they won an 80% share, and it's been pretty much 80\\u201390% ever since. Canon managed to flip the market share on Nikon by being the first to court consumers, and then by delivering the fastest speeds for pro sports shooters. But for a long time, the only 35mm, then full-frame choice for most pros was Nikon or Canon.  This last year, the whole industry sold only 11.6 million ILCs, less than half of those sold in 2013. And 2017 was actually an 8% increase from 2016. But more the point, DSLRs sold only accounted for 65% of the ILC market\\u2026 clearly, Nikon and Canon were no longer winning an 80\\u201390% share. And while Canon's mirrorless sales were up 70% in 2017, Nikon wasn't even part of that. And of course, neither was competitive with Sony, Olympus, Panasonic, or Fujifilm in higher-end mirrorless. No one knows just where the DSLR vs. mirrorless ratio settles out in the long term, but it's not going to be terribly favorable to any company only making DSLRs.  What's It For?  If you look carefully at the EOS R, like the Nikon Z's, you'll know just what it's for: the EOS R is a mirrorless body for Canon users to buy, so that they don't buy Sonys. This is the big factor. Canon users have been trying Sony A7s with adapters, and liking them. Some keep it as an accessory, but some sell their Canon gear and move to Sony. Canon needs that to stop, and their first reaction to this situation is the EOS R.  Canon's introducing one body and four lenses, two of them quite expensive, but still, that's not a full system for nearly anyone who needs a system camera. It's a start. But if you're already a Canon shooter, the R is with an adapter is going to let you try out mirrorless with all of your glass \\u2014 even EF-S lenses, but EF-M lenses are impossible \\u2014 your existing batteries and flash units, etc. It's a much simpler way to experiment with mirrorless for today's Canon shooter. If you're new to ILCs and want full-frame mirrorless, EOS R won't be a great option for at least 3\\u20135 years, depending on how quickly Canon rolls out new glass.  So you're supposed to compare the EOS R to a Sony A7 Mark III, but the closest match is actually the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV. So you're getting more or less a mirrorless 5D Mark IV with some improvements/extra features for $900 less. That's a pretty fine deal, speaking from the Canon universe. It's a bit more expensive than the A7 Mark III, but no one's more aggressive on body pricing than Sony.  I think it succeeds in its mission. If I still had my Canon system and was ready for full frame mirrorless, the EOS R is a no-brainer versus the Sony. It's not even the cost of the bodies or the minute details of the features, but the fact it's already part of my system. The cheap lens adapter is only $100, and it works perfectly. For a bit more, I could get the adapter with filter holder, simply brilliant for video work.  Video Issues  Alas, on that latter one, Canon's still being Canon, and not in a good way. They're still crippling 4K video on the EOS R, delivering the same 1.7x crop you have on the EOS 5D mark IV. If you're buying a full-frame DSLR for video, the point is to have full frame video. With that crop, you're better off going to a Panasonic GH5 or a Blackmagic Design Pocket Cinema Camera 4K, depending on your needs.  I expect for most stills work, you have a 5D Mark IV as far as the quality goes. You won't quite match Sony in very low light, but you'll have a bit more resolution in bright light, so it's probably not a big deal for most photographers. You'll have the Canon color, which Sony has yet to match, and the Canon menus you're used to\\u2026 well, maybe. They have a few new controls on the camera, which changes around the way its used. There's a programmable ring control on lenses, but you won't run into that with adapted EF lenses unless you get the third adapter, the one with the ring control. There's also a touch strip on the back, which most reviewers aren't yet crazy about.  Neither Sony nor Canon has 10-bit in-camera video, which is what you need for serious Log shooting. But the EOS R does have that as an external option, at least. I'd bet on Sony's A7S Mark III offering 10-bit in some fashion, but like Canon, Sony's got their own cinema camera business they feel compelled to protect by crippling the mirrorless models. Oddly, though, Nikon opted for the same thing, in-camera 8-bit, external 10-bit, even without a video market to protect. I guess that leaves them both with a feature to add to a higher end model, next year. Or save money and buy the GH5 right now.  Conclusions  So basically, I think the EOS R is attractive to anyone with a full Canon system thinking about mirrorless. If Canon's annoying behaviors haven't driven you away yet, this may well be your mirrorless. I don't really find any huge problems with it. Knowing that Sony was the initial target, nothing about the EOS R or the Nikon Zs were particularly unexpected. Both aim for the Sony's, Nikon at both the A7III and the A7RIII, Canon's basically doing the A7III competitor now. I would hope they're holding off an A7RIII competitor until they have some improved sensor tech, probably also going into the EOS 5DS Mark II."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "Not many if you are an enthusiast Canon shooter.

Let me share a secret with you: odds are an 80D will do nothing to help your photography, other than giving you the pleasure of using a slightly newer, slightly nicer toy.

I have worked with people shooting video around the world on 70D cameras and pockets, and even have a pocket in service now. Used ours earlier today with DSLR cameras too. I can at least give you an idea what it would be like if you had both so you know the feel.  The 70D is actually a great camera, especially as a still photo camera. If it has magic lantern, you can focus and expose video well using only the on camera display, and the picture is okay too. Also when lanterned, the white balance adjustment is fast and impossible to beat. Without lantern, it would be almost impossible to work quickly in video.   The recording codec leaves a lot to be desired, and even the flattest profile crushes the blacks to uselessness, often leaving you with unrecoverable black shapes for shoes and dark pants. It can be hard to get results. You can save the day with a custom profile like Cinestyle but it only goes so far.   Cinestyle Profile Page [ http://www.technicolor.com/en/solutions-services/cinestyle ]  For some reason, it can be impossible to get many Canon DSLR cameras to cooperate with the external viewfinder you happen to have at any moment. The camera wasn't designed for this, but it can be really angering.   It is also hard to externally power a Canon camera. You need the power source to be a very specific voltage, and can only add external power with a special battery adapter, which can be expensive. Or you could get a handful of batteries and do that depressing dance.     Then there is that pocket thing.  The pocket only lasts a few minutes on a battery, and I literally mean a few minutes. Have the camera on while wrangling actors for ten or fifteen minutes and the battery will go from full to half. ... But there is a convenient power inlet.   You just plug in an external battery and get back to work. You have to get such a battery and cabling though, and you have to figure that into the cost.  A regular broadcast battery like these works great. The left are ubiquitous Anton Bauer and on the right, a nice Switronics. Both in Bauer's Gold mount. You could also use a Sony U-60 type battery and adapter which could be more inexpensive. Either way, it's a lot easier to plumb in with the pocket.  You mention RAW, but there are several intermediate codecs that make way smaller files and image quality that completely blows away the h.264 method used with the 70D. Even the \\\"lite\\\" codec looks miles better. All of these qualify as intermediate codecs, so scrubbing backwards while editing won't light up your computer. Editing is a breeze, and the storage disks hardly have to work.  There are focus peaking and zebras in camera. The menu system is fast and clear to understand and only has a few pages, though you have to get used to using the arrows for selecting and then arrows again for adjusting.   It uses micro 4/3rds lenses, so you can adapt to about anything. People use all manner of lenses on them. Pentax, Olympus, Nikon, Panasonic...  The pocket is also milled out of a piece of aluminum, and has 1/4\\\" 20TPI tripod threads on top and bottom, which is pretty cool.    The pocket has a few disadvantages.   White balance is numerically selected in a menu. This is probably because the intermediate codecs have room for color adjustments, but if you go from a tungsten room to a parking lot, you have to scramble through the menus and dial the new temperature in off the top of your head. You can't see any histogram or scope while doing this either, you are in a menu, so you end up guessing things like 3200 for the room and 5600 for the parking lot.  It doesn't seem to hold up to harsh environments, especially jungle and desert heat. We have seen a few overheat and act up, which you rarely see happening with Canons. Haven't heard of one actually breaking permanently though.   The pocket is small, giving you the completely erroneous idea that it would be good handheld. The camera is so small, it would be pretty miraculous for you to get a good shot with it in your hands. Not that it would be much easier with the 70D, but you have to treat the pocket like any other movie camera to get the same results. Perhaps even more so because it is trying to trick you.  Stop motion would be a problem, because the camera doesn't do still pictures at all as far as I know. Also, the sensor is pretty small, so a 50mm lens is a tight portrait lens, and a 28mm is not a wide lens at all. A \\\"normal\\\" lens is about 17mm. You REALLY need to go short to get wideangle. With the 70D, at least you have big enough a sensor to get wide looking shots with a 15mm lens or something. There are jokes that the pocket is solely responsible for the booming prices of wide C mount lenses. Not sure if this is a joke or actually true.  The flat profile is shown in the display, which might take you by surprise. You'll have to make sure you are used to looking at this kind of output so it can get you where you are going.   With a fast codec, you are going to run into the storage dilemma fast. A 32GB card is never enough for anything, and you have to use UHS speed class 3 (U3) cards, as all your old class 10 cards are not fast enough. When you see that red exclamation point instead of the record symbol, you'll know you screwed up. On a 32G card, you can fit about six minutes of raw video. ProRes HQ makes that 20 minutes. At ProRes 422, about 30 minutes and this is still extremely good quality. Set to LT, 44 minutes. For online applications, there is a \\\"Proxy\\\" quality setting that makes 32GB worth about one and a half hours. You get the idea.  Hope this gives you some idea.

There are over 3,000 DApps deployed on Ethereum as of June 2021."}, {"upvote": 3, "content": "It's kind of difficult to answer without actually getting into what you want really. Will try to give a generalised answer.  General Acceptance: Ethereum better known for its market capitalisation. Means they have more money in circulation. The only coin that beats Ethereum is Bitcoin in this regard. ETH also more well known than EOS. i.e., more places you can trade especially decentralized exchanges. Ethereum also has better wallet support.  Developer Support: Ethereum's developer community is larger than EOS's. There's a vast array of developers available if one wants to develop a dApp. However, the EOS block producers and block producer candidates are (indirectly) incentivized to help the dev community by providing support, tools and sometimes funding. The amount of support for EOS currently is phenomenal.  Smart Contracts: Solidity, the smart contract language for Ethereum is very close to Javscript and is purpose built for smartcontracts. With the Python version [ https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/v0.1.0-beta.10/ ] is out, it will be easier to code. EOS supports Webassembly smartcontracts usually written on C++. Technically you can write the code in any language which can compile into WASM though. There are IDEs [ https://www.eosstudio.io/ ] to help. If you are just starting to code contracts, you would be better off with EOS in my opinion.  Scalability: ETH's blocks are produced in ~15 seconds. EOS block time is ~500milli seconds. If you are developing an app for a consumer, you may find EOS closer fit for real-world scenarios. For a better comparison, EOS supports around 1000 TPS (transactions per second) while ETH is at 15TPS. Currently EOS accounts for 68% [ https://www.blocktivity.info/ ] of the blockchain transactions while ETH has 3%. Please note that this is just a comparison. Why EOS has such a massive share has probably much to do with how transactions are designed in EOS.  Cost: dApps built on ethereum need to spend ETH as Ethereum is proof of work currently. The price volatality of ETH stops one from spending it. The cost of transaction in EOS is adjusted by their inflation model. EOS do not charge a transaction fee. It's closer to how our current internet works. So users will be more inclined to use an EOS dApp in the long run as it is cheaper or free. We are currently starting to see this is the case.  Price stability: EOS/USD price is comparatively stable compared to BTC/USD or ETH/USD. Currently BTC is bullish and many alt coins followed suit while EOS is still $5-$8 rages.  EOS's design is more to do with holding it in your own wallet and using it than trading it on exchanges. With the new REX [ https://eosauthority.com/rex_history/ ] in action you can get \\u2018interest' by holding EOS. It's a reasonable passive income opportunity.  Security & Decentralization: Both, ETH's & EOS' security is provided by the network. ETH is protected by a global set of miners. But a miner with more resources can attach more hashpower and weaken the decentralization aspect of Ethereum. The network or an ETH holder cannot stop this from happening. It's the case with Bitcoin as 60% of the hashpower is controlled by just 5 people. EOS is a democratic system. The chain is protected by 21 voted block producers based on Delegated Proof of Stake [ https://twitter.com/mixdev/status/1143769516461023232 ]. Anyone holding EOS in their wallets can vote. A rogue block producer can be voted out simply by EOS account holders not voting them essentially kicking them out from the network. This will reinstate security of the blockchain. EOS has a potential problem of vote buying and other collusion channels. But the point is, the system has means to prevent or be offensive to those who act against the network; a feature Ethereum does not have.  Sustainability & Energy Efficiency: In a way, EOS is more sustainable than ETH. EOS is 17,236 times [ https://eosauthority.com/green/ ] more energy efficient than Ethereum.  EOS block producers run highly efficient server CPUs compared to high power GPUs or ASICs of ETH mining. This cuts down emissions as well as cost by a large margin.

He claims that ordinary people are more concerned with performance than with decentralization. Larimer's goal with EOS is to develop a platform for decentralized apps that works the way users want them to.  This results in Ethereum being their main competitor! Compared to Ethereum, EOS is attempting to make it easier to develop dApps. EOS is said to require less code than Ethereum because it has more basic capabilities and is easier to learn how to use and navigate. This is critical because the majority of people lack the technical skills required to utilize Ethereum.  HOWEVER - The case to be made about Ethereum is that it is led by a VERY strong development team which is headed by our lord and saviour - Vitalik. The man is a legend and has delivered on just about every promise they made. Ethereum is slowly moving to PoS (proof of stake), which is an amazing move, and there are other good things coming to Ethereum as well.

I started with the Canon EOS series 20 plus years ago, and have owned several over the years, just not the mirrorless.  That said, I would not recommend buying the EOS R for wildlife, however if you already have it then by all means use it. From what I have read and seen online picture quality is sufficient especially if you are good at stalking the animals and getting in a good spot for the photo. So, you can certainly get good quality images using this camera.  The biggest reason I wouldn't recommend it has to do with performance. The frames per second is only around 5fps, not a lot when you have an animal or a bird that you want to capture a lot of images while it is in motion. It is also a full frame camera. In wildlife the full frame results in smaller images of the animals with the same lens used on a cropped frame sensor. The cropped frame cameras give you a little more magnification from your telephoto lenses. And, in wildlife photography getting close is what it is all about. Honestly, like hunting, wildlife photography has less to do with the equipment and more to do with the skills of the person using the equipment. I can take a great picture of a deer with a disposable camera because I personally can get within 5 yards of the deer. That said with a disposable camera I'm only going to get one shot once I get there. With a good camera I can get within 15\\u201320 yards and get multiple shots. With a great camera I can get within 40\\u201350 yards of a deer, and get as many shots as I want.  One area the full frame will help with is using available light. If you find a lot of your shots are close up in low light conditions then maybe this would be a good camera for you.  Again, I'm not saying don't use it if you already have it. I prefer to use what I have rather than spend money. However, if you don't have it I wouldn't buy it for wildlife photography."}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "As I am only an Amateur Photographer or a Hobbyist whatever then I only speak as I see things from my point of view therefore my Opinion is only that.

To answer your question and so I must say that as I have never used the Canon R series Camera therefore I cannot recommend the camera from personal experience but I am sure that it will be up to the task with the right lens for the job.  The term Wildlife Photography sure does cover a lot of different scenario's and may well span several continents and can be as diverse as Elephants and Lizards. I do like the challenge of photographing Birds which becomes as much about understanding the habits of the creatures themselves and can involve much waiting and watching as what it does any actual photographing.

You will mostly find Canon users all around and that is for a reason. When DSLRs came into vogue, Canon was pioneer in the field and Canon brought in full-frame DSLRs much before Nikon. Full-frame is considered a deity in the photography would while crop-sensor was usually scorned at. Canon also brought the speciality wildlife lenses, and was earlier to introduce Optical Image Stabilization in lenses. Consequently, a lot of photographers went to Canon in the digital age. Once you are in a family, it is a messy divorce - one is so much invested. Nikon was still not into the digital game for some 18 months or so and that cost them quite a lot.  Today, however, there is no difference. You can choose either. There are equivalent bodies and lenses. In some cases, Nikon is ahead while Canon is ahead in other aspects. I challenge anyone who says one is better than other - people who say that are those carry along some brand loyalty and a small prejudice.  When it comes to wildlife, I will suggest a camera body with the following features:   * Crop sensor is better because it gives a natural crop zoom advantage (1.5x in case of Nikon, 1.6x in case of Canon). Doesn't mean that full-sensor is no-no.  * Absolutely essential that your camera and lens is weather sealed, environmentally protected against rain, water splash, humidity, dust, etc. (Repeat again, that body and lens, both need to be weather sealed).  * Need fast continuous frame rate. At the very least 5 fps. This is because you would mostly shoot in this mode to freeze action.  * Should have fast and accurate autofocus system with more number of AF points.  * Buttons are quicker than LCD based menu system (whether touchscreen or not). The more buttons you have, the more quick controls you get. So a body with more specialised buttons is the way to go.  * You also need good lenses with long reach. They also need to be fast because you generally observe wild life action during dusk and later evening times. Slow lenses don't work well and AF is painfully slow or even lost. You also cannot get too close. Consider lenses with a reach of at least 400 mm but 500 mm is the recommended length. A 500 mm, f/4 is the lens you would want.  * I would recommend either Canon EOS 7D Mark II or Nikon D500 as the first choice. If you wish to go little cheaper than go for Canon EOS 80D or Nikon D7500.

Let me give you this piece of advice: your camera is the least important thing in your camera bag. Lenses and lighting are far more important, and by far the most important piece of gear is the one between your ears. Invest your money accordingly.  A 5DS r is going for $3,700 new. An EOS R is going for $2000 for just the body. So I'm going to say your total budget is around $4500. A good rule of thumb is to spend 30% of your budget on the body and 70% on lenses. That gives you a budget of around $1350 for a camera body.  As a novice, you just don't need the capabilities of a state of the art camera. I have a 5D mark IV, and honestly 95% of the time any one of my older cameras (5D mark II, 7D, 50D) is going to do the job well enough.  Bottom line is that any pro-grade DSLR made in the last 10 years is going to serve your needs perfectly well. Save your money and buy a used 5D mark III ($900-$1200) or even a 5D mark II ($500\\u2013$800). Some reputable dealers for used equipment are B&H, Adorama, Abe's of Maine, KEH, and 42nd Street Photo.  Pair that body with a good general-purpose zoom lens like the EF 24\\u201370 f/4L IS ($900) to start with. The only other must-have accessories you need with that are a circular polarizing filter (around $100) and good tripod. That is a great kit to get you started learning photography.  Save the rest of your money for now until you reach the creative limits of your initial kit\\u2026 You shouldn't buy anything you don't have a specific need for.

My second lens was the EF 100 f/2.8L macro because I was limited in my ability to do flower pictures by not having a macro lens. My next several purchases were lighting gear. I've bought other pieces of equipment over the years to add new capabilities to allow me to do things I couldn't do with the equipment I had at the time.

I had used Cannon in the past and with some disappointment I became a Sony user. Now, if at all I go out of Sony circle, I may land in Nikon group.   Regarding how to select a camera, I follow a three point formula: (1) choose the features (2) get satisfied with the quality of pictures (3) get the best price   For choosing the model based on the features each camera is offering I go to some of the camera comparison websites which give side by side comparison e.g., Side-by-side camera comparison [ http://www.dpreview.com/products/compare/cameras ], Compare the latest cameras and get personalized recommendations [ http://snapsort.com ]. These sites also give some reviews for each model.   Once I short list few cameras based on the features I need, I go to websites like flickr and select pictures by my camera model. Here I get to see thousands of (both good and bad) pictures taken with that particular camera model. This gives an idea of how well we can use that camera or how bad our picture can be based on camera capability and of course our own skill level. Hopefully this gives you an opportunity to trim down your camera list.   Now go to some reputed online shopping portals and scout around for good price. Why only reputed sites - because you may need support after sales also. Some sites, even though they offer products at a cheaper price, they may not give proper bill for the product; may give trouble in case you need to return the product in case of any issue with the product etc.       Hope this helps you and anyone who is planning to buy a new camera."}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "Go for Nikon or Sony for a better Image Quality.

Not a problem if you are concentrating upon portraits, but a bit on the long end. An 85mm is an ideal portrait lens on a full-frame camera, nice perspective and short enough to let you work close to your subject for a powerful relationship with your subject. However, on an APS camera the crop forces you back into a much more formal relationship. This results in a colder and less intimate portrait.  If you were an experienced photographer, you would not be asking the question. Give serious consideration to the most wide ranging kit zoom as you can afford your first lens. It will give you the chance to explore not only distance at the various focal lengths, but also the subjective emotional impact of various focal lengths.

There are various types of portraits and they require different focal lengths. Environmental portraits may require a focal length of 24mm so that the environment surrounding the subject can also be captured. For head and shoulder portraits, longer focal lengths like 85mm or even 135mm work well. So, it is a matter of what kind of portraits you want to shoot. Also, you must understand that a longer focal length will allow you to get more shallow depth of field for same  aperture i.e. dof of 135mm f/1.8 will be far shallower than dof of 50mm f/1.8. So, first decide which focal length you are comfortable with and then get a prime lens for that focal length with widest aperture.  Personally, I believe a 50mm f/1.8 prime is a good overall portrait lens on a crop sensor. If you can afford, go for a 50mm f/1.2.   If you are looking for more shallow dof and don't care much about capturing surrounding environment or background, go for 85mm or 135mm prime lenses.  If you can sacrifice some shallow dof for better coverage go for a 24mm or 35mm lens.   In the above mentioned option, I would pick a 50mm f/1.8 over a 40mm f/2.8."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "What kind of user are you ?   I recently got my 600d combo with the 18-55mm and 55-250mm lens kit.   I pondered over the same question for long.People usually prefer 40mm for the build quality and whatnot.   I for not dont give a damn about having a plastic feeling on my palms as I focus. Secondly I dont care whether the lens is sleek or not. Thirdly I am careful enough with my lens not to break them. I investing in polymer pouches for all 3 of my lenses and also got a decent size backpack for my accessories and lenses. Plus if I get a added aperture of 1..8, I cant ask for more.  For portraits to get a good enough focus, you need 2.8. But on my crop sensor, the 50mm will go upto 80mm which is not my style of portraiture. The 40m would go upto 64mm roughly. Still not good enough. So usually i take my stock lens and turn it upto to 35mm to get a realistic 50mm look.     So for taking shots of tiny objects from upclose, my 50mm 1.8 II lens helps me. Plus macro comes best in 50mm 1.8 if you spend 200-300 bucks on a macro reversal ring.   If you go for the 50mm 1.8, there is canon ofcourse but yongnou a competitive brand for speedlights and flash accessories has also taken out a new 50mm 1.8 which is similar to canon in all respects and also is just for 80$ whereas canon 50mm 1.8 II is 125$-100$.

A 50mm lens is of course a normal lens on a full frame camera, a reasonable portrait lens on an APS-C camera. The fast, wise aperture makes this lens good for low light. The difference between f/1.8 and f/1.4 is only 2/3 of a f-stop... useful but not profound. You get a bit shallower depth of field, a bit faster shutter speed or lower ISO, but nothing game-changing.  There is a tradition among film camera companies to offer the nifty-fifty, a really cheap 50mm f/1.8 lens. But here's the thing: these are cheap only in construction. The image quality is usually top-notch. I used to own the 50mm f/1.4 for my Canon full frame 6D, which was about 3.5x more expensive. For that, you got a better mechanical build, quieter focusing motor, and yeah, an extra 2/3 stop. By by the time you're stopped down at f/2.0 or so on either lens, there was no significant difference.  Today, my main system is Micro Four Thirds. The first thing I did in that system was buy prime lenses: 20mm f/1.7, 25mm f/1.8, 45mm f/1.8, 17mm f/1.8, and 75mm f/1.8 \\u2026 over the course of several years. The faster lenses basically put my m43 system where my full frame was with the 24\\u2013105mm f4.0L zoom, far as light goes. Probably a bit sharper, too. Today I have a few fast zooms, and a manual 25mm f/0.95 for those really low light situations.  Shooting with primes vs. zooms is a personal choice. It's not for everyone and not for every situation. If just starting out, I'd get the 50mm f/1.8, just because these are sold at can't-say-no prices. I own an Olympus 30mm f/3.5 macro lens for much the same reason: at $99, I could literally not say no. Go from there. Learn that lens, see how it affects your photography. Moving from a zoom to a prime can be good for you, creatively. You have to think through a shot a bit more, maybe move your feet a bit to a different location, etc. You get to play with depth of field in ways not available with the usual f/3.5-f/5.6 kit lens. You will be using a lens that's sharper than your sensor, so you'll be using your camera to its fullest extent."}, {"upvote": 16, "content": "As per reviews it is a crap lens.

So sure, it's possible to use a 50mm lens as a landscape lens. But that's not the whole story. I shot about 30 photos to create this image. It's about 100 megapixels total, composed of individual overlapping 16 megapixel images.  I actually do find this one of my favorite ways to shoot landscape photos. That's because, of course, landscapes often do benefit from large aspect ratios. On a different trip to Arizona, I brought only a camera with a 50mm lens equivalent on full frame camera, and that really didn't get in the way of a couple mountain hikes and lots of landscape shots.  But even in shooting composites, you sometimes really need a wider lens to capture what you want with a landscape. This is another 30-something shot composite, but with a 24mm-equivalent lens.  And of course, while the wide aspect ratio is often what you want, it isn't always. Sometimes a 3:2 or 4:3 image is just want you do want, particularly if a big sky is part of what you want to capture. Though actually in this case, travelling downhill, I used the full-frame equivalent of a 60mm lens, just one shot.  It's a very useful exercise to go out with just one lens and try to do things that you don't think will work with that lens. Of course, if you're shopping for a lens, I'm not sure a 50mm would be my first choice for landscapes. But the normal focal length, 50mm on a full-frame, 30mm on an APS-C, 25mm on a Micro Four Thirds camera, that's a must-have, IMHO, if you're shooting with prime lenses at all. Which you should.  You can cover more area \\u2014 the point of a wide angle lens \\u2014 with multiple shots intended for a composite. That's useless for action, but for the typical landscape, not a problem. You wind up with a higher resolution image than your camera's sensor, of course. You can always downscale if you don't want to keep the full thing. Going the other way, you can't use a wide-angle lens to sub for a normal or tele, the only option is cropping, and that lowers the resolution very quickly. So if I had just one to pick for any activity, I'd go with the normal over a wide angle.  I didn't always understand this. In fact, when I was sixteen, I saved up my window-washing money and bought a 17mm f/3.5 Soligor lens for my Olympus OM-1, prior to a 5-week family trip to the West.

I've done all of these. I can think of many more applications for such a lens. Some would be useful with a very sharp 24mm f/1.4 lens, others would be good with such a lens if it had weird bokeh, a lot of chromatic aberration, or other defects that can be put to creative use.

The 40 STM is of course slower by a couple of stops, so if you are after shallower DOF or shooting in darker environments, the 50s will have higher potential to do it. Doesn't mean its a given.  Care needs to be taken as the DOF at f/1.x apertures is so thin, that it becomes tricky: Users often blame the lens or AF system, but take it for granted that close to the MFD (minimum focus distance), a high percentage of shots will be missfocused when shooting hand held.   So in a nutshell, don't get a 50 for sharper images. They are not bad by any measure,  just  won't deliver better vs a EF 40 STM."}, {"upvote": 23, "content": "After 60 years of photography I can say that the f/2.8 lens is usually the better value. The extra two stops you gain are at the expense of several things. One is money, you are charged a premium for a fast lens.  Secondly f/1.4 lenses are rarely sharp wide open and you have to stop down to f/2.8 anyway to get any kind of optimal sharpness.  Thirdly there is such a slight depth of field with ultra fast lenses like that, that the resulting image is composed of mostly out of focus areas.  It is like a toy that is over used.  Ultra fast lenses were prized in the film days because of low ISO film, with digital it is a non problem.  Fourthly, portraiture is often presented to us as a choice of using some kind of shallow depth of field, and in the 19th century, although the lenses were slow by our standards today, they were long enough with enough aperture to create a shallow depth of field. Besides they were ground to be soft (Petzval lenses)with a beautiful bokeh. But you can achieve a beautiful bokeh with many lenses and you certainly do not need nor is it even desirable to work at f/1.4 or anywhere that shallow a depth of field.  In fact portraiture is often shot at f/8 and is a much better portrait. But even if you like the tip of the nose out of focus, you can shoot at f/4 and get the same effect as long as the lens is reasonably long.  Which is my objection to using a 50 mm lens on an APS sensor, it is too short so as to compensate for the increased depth of field, people shoot at f/1.4.  My suggestion is get a longer lens. Get an 85mm for an APS sensor and shoot at a sensible f/stop. I personally use a 135mm lens which is as long as is practical for portraiture.  The last objection I have to ultra fast lenses, is that there is by necessity a lot of glass hanging off the end of your camera. It is heavier and worse, a lot of glass means a lot of opportunities for lens flare.  I have two ultra fast lenses out of about 20 lenses. A 50mm f/1.4 that came with my Nikon F in 1968. It was my only lens and I used it to shoot somewhere in excess of 100,000 images. I would do it differently today, but I was young and that was what I had. I also have a 20mm f/1.8 lens. That is what they make, the 20 mm is brilliantly sharp and since that is how it was made I live with the ultra fast nature and just do not use it at f/1.8, even though it is sharp at f/1.8, and being such a short lens it has a lot of depth of field.  There are few \\u2018better' answers out there in photography, the reason they make the equipment is because people will use the gear as it is useful for something.  In order to market gear there are several selling or marketing , not scams, but ways to differentiate in a meaningless way one product from another.  In photography this is what is a marketing characteristic meant to up-sell you the consumer.  Ultra fast lenses, faster than f/2.8 are generally just to gain extra dough from you.  More mega pixels than you can possible use. After 16 megapixels it is a niche part of the market that can use more mega pixels. After 24 mega pixels it is a very small niche. It does have a bearing on very large prints but you are not making very large prints in all probability. The pixels simply get lost if you are not printing at the largest size. But it is a marketing thing to sell people on the idea of a \\u2018better' camera.  The features that do have value are:  Weather sealing, is a big deal if you go out in inclement weather or high humidity. Not everyone does, but if you do that is a big deal.  Dynamic range is a medium deal, but the greater the dynamic range the easier it is to make a perfect exposure and not lose any detail.  The best feature that I can think of in a digital camera is relatively clean high ISO's. If you can make a native sized print at ISO 6400, after noise reduction it still has detail, then you have got something worth spending extra for.  But that is it, all digital cameras reproduce color equally as well. There is no \\u2018better' brand one from the other.  Some systems are better suited for specific purposes that are niche oriented. But for the vast majority of photographers and photography all cameras are equal. Some are just more equal than others."}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Canon-EOS-700D-cheaper-than-600D", "question": "Why is Canon EOS 700D cheaper than 600D", "answers": [{"upvote": 4, "content": "600D is a discontinued model.

But even so, I don't consider myself to be a professional.  To me, the word professional is very ambiguous. The real meaning of the word \\\"professional\\\" is that you are making a living out of your photography, so in this case the camera must be able to produce photos with image quality that surpass the minimum photo-publishing requirements. In this case, a 700D with its 18MP Canon sensor that's also being used in the 7D meets the requirement, as the image quality produced by the 700D will satisfy at the very least the minimum standard requirement of many photographers; so it's safe to say it's good enough to be considered a \\\"professional camera\\\". A lot of low-budget studios where I live, which I consider to be professional photography studio, even still use the good-old 500D for passport headshots and similar stuffs, and they make money from it; that makes the 500D a \\\"professional camera\\\". I'm pretty sure that the photos from the 700D are also good enough to even get pass the very strict requirement of a lot of professional stock photography agencies. So there's that one kind of professional.    On the other hand, the assumed meaning of the word \\\"professional camera\\\" that the camera manufacturers and marketing departments tried to emphasize to us is the camera with the most feature packed with a very high price-level. Well, in this case, the 700D is not a professional camera, and the manufacturer will push you towards a 7D, 5D or 1D, in hope that you'll buy those products with a much higher margin to both cover the operational cost of the manufacturer and make more profit for the company. They don't care if you make a living out of your camera or not, but the 7D, 6D, 5D, and 1D are professional cameras. That's another kind of professional.  Now let's discuss the 700D specifically. I don't personally own the 700D but I used to own a 650D for one year, and it's spec'ed very similar to the 700D. The 650D/700D can shoot 18MP RAW or JPEG with a CMOS sensor that's very similar to the sensor on the high-end Canon 7D. It does shoot at 4 or 5fps burst image, it shoot 30fps video at 1080p, it has a decent viewfinder, and a good all-around control as well as menu.   Upgrading from a 650D/700D to a 7D, a \\\"professional\\\" camera, will give you faster burst image at 8fps, weather-sealing, better view-finder, more extensive manual control, and a heavier body. But it will not give you a better image quality.   Upgrading to a 5D Mark III will give you a somewhat cleaner image quality at high ISO, better control, better viewfinder, weather-sealing, better video output, but you're back with 5fps burst speed, and you'll have to invest to full-frame lenses.   Upgrading to 1D, you'll get 7D fast-performance with an almost-5D-like image quality, but it'll cost you as much as a used decent car.  Now the important question that you'll have to ask for yourself is: will you make more money if you have a 7D, 6D, 5D, or a 1D? Maybe yes, maybe no. But one thing for sure, you'll have to spend more money to buy those cameras than if you buy the 700D. Can you justify that? Do you really need to have those features on those so-called professional cameras, or can you live with just the features on the 700D?  I personally don't give too much thought about using the so-called professional cameras. As long as I can deliver the results needed by the clients or by yourself, I think I'm happy. My 650D could deliver the result that I require back then, and to my book, it's good enough. I don't know about you, nor do I know about your photography requirement, so I can't speak for you.  To conclude, I quoted a small part of David Thorpe's blog post with the title \\\"Is This Camera Professional\\\". David Thorpe is an ex-photojournalist from UK, a true professional photographer in my opinion. Here's that quote:   %3E When John Downing took the classic picture of a stunned Margaret Thatcher leaving the Imperial hotel in Brighton, England, after the IRA had bombed it, he had been having a drink in the bar. The bomb went off and John couldn't get to his room to get his \\u2018proper' cameras. But he he had a Canon Sureshot, the same as my mum used on holiday, in his pocket.  And it was on the Sureshot that the pic was made.  That makes it a professional camera in my book. Cameras are not professional, people are. An Olympus Pen in Sebastaio Delgado's hands is a professional camera. A Nikon D4 in my sister's is not.

Ichigo is leagues if not light years ahead of Naruto if you take into account normal linear power scaling.  Linear power scaling simply means that if a character is involved in defeating a character, he is immediately scaled above said character. This is obviously wrong for a multitude of reasons because this only works in-verse and not for cross verse scaling.  What a lot of people do is scale EoS Ichigo to Soul King Yawach who is confirmed Multiversal+  and scale EoS Naruto to Kaguya and Momoshiki who are confirmed Star if not Galaxy level  Based on this scaling Ichigo blitzes Naruto into oblivion and then proceeds to stomp Goku who is only universal.  Now you see the giant flaw in this logic?  While both of them might be strong in their respective verses while calculating cross-verse the only thing you can use to compare two characters with are pure feats. You can only linearly power scale if the two characters you are comparing are relative, which in this case are Kaguya and Yawach, who unfortunately are not.  No matter how much you complain Yawach is simply far too Hax to be anywhere near Kaguya or Momoshiki's level despite how powerful each of them are physically. The All-Mighty is reality-warping with omnipotence/omniscience added in the mix. Even if he can't kill the two, he's not getting killed any time either.  Putting that into perspective, purely feat wise EoS Naruto and Ichigo are actually quite comparable.  Since we don't know how powerful Ichigo's true Bankai actually is, we can only scale him until the point where he uses the Horn of Salvation, in which his strongest attack is his Gran-Ray Getsuga Tenshou.  Without that vital piece of data, saying Ichigo scales above Naruto is honestly a far-fetched guess at best. That's why so many scales safely put Dangai Ichigo/FGT Ichigo above True Bankai since quite clearly the FGT gave better results than the Gran Rey Getsuga.  This will obviously change when the 2022 Bleach Project releases. When originally writing TYBW Kubo only had 3 chapters to end the entire series, so instead of wasting time with Ichigo's Bankai he instantly skipped to the end of the war. With his involvement in the upcoming arc, there is a chance that we will its true abilities.  Until then here are the feats people generally use to scale Ichigo and Naruto and why this puts them as equals and not superiors.  ICHIGO IS FASTER THAN NARUTO AND HAS BETTER REACTION SPEEDS  This is correct in many cases. Even before TYBW Ichigo was dodging light-based attacks with relative ease, going as far back as the Soul Society Arc. We can safely scale him above most Second Seats and Captains from the Gotei 13 and all of them easily dodged the Negaccion at point-blank range, which means Ichigo could as well:  Otherwise, still, we see Ichigo dodge a Lanza at point-blank range from Ulquiorra while he was wearing a broken hollow mask. This is more than enough conclusive evidence to prove that Ichigo's reaction speed is much faster than light speed.  And it is confirmed that all of the Espada's attacks (Cero's especially) are light-based. So there is no point in debating that.  Coming to Naruto we can also safely put him at the same reaction speed seeing his fights against Ay and Juudara.  Although this feat is under scrutiny since later he couldn't even dodge Sasuke's Amenotejikara later in their fight at the Valley of the End, which is definitely slower than the speed of light.  Speed-wise Naruto is slower. Based on his fight against Ay he practically can be put near the return speed of lightning which is 2 x10^8 m/s whereas Ichigo was able to go from the Soul King's Palace all the way to Soul Society in a matter of 9 hours, a journey that would take one week for a Zero Squad Member at Full Speed.  This puts his speed at 2 x the speed of light, which is approximately 6 x 10^8 m/s.   %3E You can check out the calculations I used to get to this conclusion here, just skip to the bottom half: https://www.quora.com/If-Ichigo-Kurosaki-from-Bleach-and-Sung-Jin-Woo-from-Solo-Leveling-got-into-a-fight-who-would-win/answer/Nikhil-Guru-4  %3E There will be a section marked Ichigo is confirmed FTL+, read and you should get a good picture. So Ichigo takes this one by a breeze.  ICHIGO IS UNIVERSAL BECAUSE HE BROKE THROUGH A BLACK HOLE AND A POCKET DIMENSION  This is the most popular way of scaling Ichigo all the way to a universal level, and sorry to say without his True Bankai scaling, all of this is just smoking hot baloney.  For one people need to understand that power scaling in Bleach occurs purely on the basis of the amount of Reiatsu that a character has.  This is established as early on as the Soul Society arc, back when Kenpachi first mopped the floor with him.  The only reason why Ichigo was able to break out of Aizen's Kurohitsugi is because in Dangai, Ichigo was in a completely different dimension when it came to spiritual pressure.  Aizen explains it as Exactly how a 2-dimensional object could never perceive a 3-dimensional object.  Simply put Aizen's attack was not able to cross the gap in Reiatsu between him and Ichigo. That's immediately fixed in his Butterfly form when he is able to damage Ichigo using a fragor.  Basically what's happening here is the Fragor was able to cover the gap in between their Reiatsu and damage Ichigo. However this doesn't mean that Aizen had greater AP than Ichigo, it just means he was able to breach his defenses. Ichigo still had much greater AP than Aizen which is further demonstrated when he goes FGT.  The same theory is applied to his Dimensional Feat, however, it is much more usable since the gap between the users Reiatsu wasn't as vast as when using FGT.  But this doesn't mean Ichigo has no AP. As a matter of fact, this means the opposite.  What this means basically is that Ichigo is so broken, that if the opponent isn't even in the same Reiatsu range he can literally brush off their attacks like nothing ever happened. In other words, if Naruto cannot prove that he has more Reiatsu than him; Ichigo would bounce off any and all attacks as if they were glorified bouncy balls.  However, given the circumstances, we can say that Ichigo is not Universal nor Multiversal, and we have already established that while Yawach is multiversal we will not be scaling Ichigo to him because we don't know the power of his True Bankai.  Instead, I would put Ichigo at Planetary level at best, given his feats against the other Quincy, Segunda Etapa Ulquiorra, Hogyoku Butterfly Aizen, and Yawach vs Horn of Salvation (where Yawach actually tried dodging the Gran Ray Getsuga).  This does not mean Naruto is stronger than Ichigo. While he has a more diverse arsenal, he does not have the same AP that Ichigo brags. Naruto's best feat is destroying the Chibaku Tensei asteroids Juudara summoned  Which are way smaller than the single Asteroid that Zaraki Kenpachi obliterated with his Shikai.  As explained by Askkin, this entire meteor was able to destroy the entirety of Soul Society which consists of both Rokongai and the 13 Court Guards, which has been confirmed by other answers on Quora as the size of a tiny planet.  TYBW Horn of Salvation Ichigo is scaled much higher than this, and on countless multipliers as well. Putting all of this together its pretty easy to say that both Ichigo and Naruto have very similar if not identical AP's when not factoring in Ichigo's true Bankai.  ICHIGO TANKED A NUKE AND IS THEREFORE MORE DURABLE THAN NARUTO  Again now, Ichigo tanked a Lanza which is a continent wiping attack whereas Naruto tanked Toneris Flame Wheel which is confirmed Planetary  The difference is astronomical. But there is a silver lining. Naruto did Tank the attack but it did undo his KCM cloak. Ichigo on the other hand stopped the Lanza with his bare hands. While Naruto's feat is better Ichigo's feat is more consistent.  NARUTO WIPES THE FLOOR WITH ICHIGO, BECASUE HE DEFEATED KAGUYA WHO IS STAR LEVEL  This is baloney.  If you said this about DMS Kakashi then I would accept it. But putting together two manga statements and an obscure line from the novels does not put Naruto above Kaguya.  Now I'm not denying that Kaguya is Star level. There is too much evidence stating that she has the power to destroy galaxies. While there is a disparity when it comes to Momoshiki, Kaguya is almost confirmed Galaxy+ level.  Now people take this one statement wildly out of context, seeing how vague it is. In one line you have Black Zetsu saying that Kaguya absorbed all the Chakra from her dimension and then in the next we have him saying she's creating a new time space. Again at the very least this is evidence that she's at least galaxy level.  But this does NOT put Naruto above Kaguya, since he wasn't the one to defeat her. While he was able to tag her actively, he wasn't the one to seal her. That credit goes entirely to Hagoromo  None of Naruto's attacks seem to be able to objectively harm Kaguya. While he was dishing in the hurt, she was able to recoil relatively easily and bounce back with more AP than Naruto.  I will give him credit for actually slicing off her arm, but apart from that he really didn't do anything.  To iterate one last time: Taggining someone does not make you equal to them. The entire fight was just Naruto and Sasuke playing a game of tag.  .  .  .  So these are my reasons for why people think Naruto stomps Ichigo and why that isn't true. While Ihcigo has more scalable feats that put him above Naruto, in no way or form is the gap between them astronomical. I'd say in EoS form both of them would come out as equals, that is until we find out about Ichigo's True Bankai.  Hope this helps!!!  NGV"}, {"upvote": 95, "content": "Yes he is. People like Quora User like to downplay Bleach for some reason. Everyone who has sufficient intelligence knows Ichigo destroys Naruto. There is no contest between these two. People can wank Naruto as high as they want, there are still metas that will make Ichigo stronger still.  We know the Human Realm is much larger than just planet.  Rukia calls it a universe.  There are references to galaxies mentioned by Ichigo.  Planets like Mars exist.  So no. It's not just planet sized.   The Soul Society also has to be universal as well since the Soul Society and the Human Realm are replicas of one another.  There is a place within the Soul Society that is a prison and infinite in size. It's called Muken.  Kaname and his friend were literally looking at thousands of stars in the sky in this one panel.

There is no need to go look for scans of those since it really doesn't matter. This is enough proof already.   Than this chad Yahwach was like.  You know what? I don't like this. I'm going to destroy all of this and recreate it.  You want to know how Ichigo responded?  And before some Naruto fanboys start typing some BS about how Yahwach still being stronger I'm going to put an end to that here.  In Bleach you have to be relative to the person you are fighting in order to harm them or use any hax against them. This isn't Naruto where someone weaker can harm someone stronger. That doesn't work in Bleach.  So if Yahwach has the power to casually destroy these realms, and Ichigo (who needs to be relative in order to harm him) causes physical damage to Yahwach, what does that say about Ichigo?  Ichigo destroys Naruto with no difficulty."}, {"upvote": 8, "content": "Is he tho? While I agree Ichigo's stronger than Naruto, He is not leagues above Naruto  So idk where does Ichigo scale but what I do know is where he does not scale   * Universal(even scaling Ichigo to 5D has more to back it up than universal) I'll do you a favour, I'm going to ignore how SS and HM were called worlds repeatedly and that Yhwach's plan was certainly limited only to the planets that are actual important in the story with Yhwach destroying anything more than that being completely unnecessary wank  So what is it that Yhwach is going to do? He is going to mix these 3 (SS, HM,LW) together  But is he going to physically destroy or recreate anything in these 3? The answer is no, becouse we do know for a fact that no one was going to be physically harmed or injured with Urahara and Askin even expecting to see and live in that world if Yhwach won  Next sorce of uni wank  Debunk:  Next sorce of wank  Near infinite? Come on it's clear that it is not infact infinite(because of the word near in there)and that this is just an expression for enough  Also shit like people such as Yamamoto destroying the soul society can be used to show the soul society isn't a planet anyway. I mean 15,000,000 degrees Kelvin? ah nice a simple nuke goes up to 100,000,000 degrees  Even if we say Yamamoto was directly channelling plasma from the suns core that's only caculated at small country level  Hell max wank for Yamamoto is sun level which cannot in anyway destroy anything above the planet so stop it with this scan  Those stars that these people have no access to and isn't actually a part of the word building are not seen as a part of the soul SOCIETY (check the definition of the word society if you can't tell why outer space isn't seen as a part of it)  So how stronge is Ichigo?

Now regarding speed: I literally have over 15 ways to prove Ichigo ain't lightspeed at the moment but I'll just give 5 here to keep this short  1. The most obvious one is this Gin even stated that he was lying, having EXAGRATED the speed so it would sound like a bankai to fake what his bankai's ability truly was meaning the 500\\u00d7 sound us after a 5\\u00d7 or 10\\u00d7 bluff (bankai gives a 5\\u00d7 to 10\\u00d7 boost remember)   * 2- the linear scaling Ichigo's progression is fairly slow and consistent (until the TYBWA)  Let me explain  At the beginning of the series where Ichigo has just gotten his powers even normal humans like this guy were keeping up with him  He than faces Renji and even tho his out matched his still relitive to Renji enough to barely react  He than gets a power up where even tho Renji is still relitive to enough to barely react to Ichigo  This progression is true and simple to keep track of upto Mugetsu and Ichigo wouldn't get anywhere near lightspeed   * 3-this is kind of a big lowbal but it's solid so This fight is stated to have taken 11 seconds and using this Ichigo's combat speed can't even be scaled to sound   * 4- here are people faster than Soifon being honered with the title LIGHTNING SPEED  * 5- let's see what else? Here's the fandom page So when you see light in the SS arc being dodged and that light is tangible, being able to pick people up IT IS NOT LIGHT  Anyway you might argue that Ichigo alot stronger than this scaling Mugetsu to true Shikai (which at first I thought was being said as a joke tbh)  Note how he failed to finish/blitze the fight in 1/48th of a second (which can even be used for putting him at even below hyper sonic)  Even captain level opponents can use their hax on him\\ud83d\\ude24 he was stronger but still relitive to Renji/captain level opponents (Renji has only gotten like a 4\\u00d7 power up 2\\u00d7 from the bath water and 2\\u00d7 from learning the full name)  This statement is all there is to suggest otherwise  But it ignores that there's nothing implying that Ichigo is using all the powers that his regained here, infact we know that he isn't becouse Mugetsu had things like Bankai (10\\u00d7) and his hollow(at least a 100\\u00d7 boost) missing so while the power Ichigo has access to here can be compared to Mugetsu using this statement, this statement cannot be used to scale Shikai specifically  Also for those who say Yhwach was holding him back I ask how much? Did he hold him back 10%? Maybe 90%? Maybe 99%? Either way the boosts Ichigo had but was not using should have been more than enough to make up for the Yhwach nerf(if you can't tell I'm still doing you a favour by ignoring how Yhwach said that he occasionally gave his own powers to make up for the nerf he gave Ichigo)  Maybe it's best to explain it like this: if Yhwach had said Ichigo that his as strong as ever while he was in human form, could we use that to say human Ichigo is above Mugetsu? No! We could only say that the overall raw power Ichigo has access to  Becouse while we separate things like fullbring shikai Ichigo from fullbring bankai in bleach Ichigo is seen as just the current Ichigo or Ichigo from that time he fought Ginjo or things like that  Better example:  1. A general sees soldier A on the street 2. General says soldier A is his strongest soldier 3. This is happening while soldier B who is the second strongest soldier is fully armed back in a military base Can we use this to say that soldier A even while empty handed is stronger than soldier B even while his fully armed? Nop, it only means that soldier A while fully armed is stronger than soldier B while fully armed  Now I'm not going to go over where does Naruto scale here because I think I've proven my point about Ichigo's power levels being overrated (tho at least lightspeed Naruto kind of has some bullshit narrative backing it up)but long story short similar to Ichigo's 11second fight we have the same method for scaling Naruto  https://www.quora.com/Six-paths-Naruto-or-Baryon-Mode-Naruto-vs-Sukuna-who-wins/answer/L-Lawliet-621 So why does Ichigo win and what advantage does he have over Naruto?  1. He probably scales 2 blitze tiers above Naruto and while I'd argue Naruto can handle 1 because of shadow clones slowing down the opponent 2 is probably too much for him 2. Naruto(and his entire verse)is really weak to sharp objects as I explained in the answer (it's kind of important if his going to go against the guy who's verse is built on swords) 3. Ichigo has infinite stamina 4. Ichigo's power is more concentrated What do I mean it's more concentrated? Have you watched ant man? He gets small and so even tho his power is the same it's far more effective against his opponents  So  A small person with the power level X %3E%3E a larger person with the exact same power level  Naruto is as strong as Ichigo but only when he does this  The problem is that similar to what Isshiki did this would allow Ichigo to dance circles around Naruto and tare Naruto's avatar to pieces so Naruto can't being his full power to the table like Ichigo can  Good day\\ud83d\\udc4b  Part 2 done"}, {"upvote": 15, "content": "I've done an answer on Naruto vs Ichigo check it out here!  https://www.quora.com/Can-Ichigo-solo-the-Naruto-verse/answer/Illumi-20?ch=99&amp;oid=303382727&amp;share=fdcd9559&amp;srid=uaZk8u&amp;target_type=answer "}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "scaling turns into a point of contention so I will shorten it.  ichigo beats naruto via speed blitz due to the extreme differences in speed metas for both series.  if it's by power, I would say it doesn't matter as much long as ichigo is somewhat relevant (which he is) to narutos greatest durability feat. which was tanking a moon cutting slash. vs ichigo who outscales yamamoto's zanka no tachi which has statements suggesting that going all out would destroy the soul society.  and ywach having shown that his raw reiatsu can destroy multiple worlds, even with the lowball it would still put ichigo at multi planetary.  what I disagree however which everyone downplays in bleach for some reason is speed. death battle does this fallacy where they only use his only recorded speed and assume he hasn't gotten faster at all, for example they use the lightning speed scan from soul society arc ichigo (practically baby ichigo) to argue (and while he still outspeeds naruto, it is much lower than the actual speed) and assumes they never get faster while ignoring speed scalings from other characters like liutenants dodging negacion while off guard (which soul society Ichigo scales to by speed blitzing 3 Liutenants, one of which was able to damage yamamoto genryusai making him relative to yamamoto, and the other being in a squad whose greatest trait is their speed), and aaroniero running away from light. while naruto has irrefutable light speed to ftl feats via light speed fang's databook at the end of the series. ichigo is one which requires calc stacking to get right which people never do."}, {"upvote": 6, "content": "Most people say it because it is true.

He's shown thinking ahead like preventing Naruto from using Shadow Clones and forcing him on the defensive.

They always think they like this which is how they always seem to always have a way to oneup each other.  Sasuke was absolutely destroying Naruto in there first fight at the valley but once Naruto used kurama he got his ass kicked.

For the sake of comparison, I will be using KCM2 (Kurama Chakra Mode V2) Naruto with Sage Mode stacked on top. Let's just look at some Naruto Feats.  Speed  KCM1 Naruto dodged the Raikage. First, we need to Sasuke's Kirin. Kirin was stated to be able to move at 1/5 of Lightspeed or 223538876.46146503 mph. Itachi who was partially blind and injured was able to slightly react to this move. Sasuke who was uninjured and had healthy Mangekyou was being blitzed by the raikage. And we know for a fact that all Sharingan have evolved reaction time and since Itachi partially blind was able to react to lightning move there is no reason to believe that Sasuke CAN'T react to it since he has a healthy Mangekyo Sharingan compared to Itachi. This means we can reasonably clock the Raikage at around 1/5 of Lightspeed.  KCM1 Naruto was weaker than KCM2. We can assume KCM2 Naruto is around 5 times stronger than KCM1. So it's plausible to say KCM2 Naruto is around 1/4 of Lightspeed.  Attack Potency  KCM2 Naruto had access to the Bijuu-Dama. The Tailed Beast Bomb. A tailed beast bomb has around city-level AP. Naruto is able to make shadow clones and spam Tailed beast bombs. He can likely fire off around 100, before running out of chakra.  Naruto was able to make 7 Tailed beast bombs amplified by Wind Release with relative ease. So he could likely make around 100 before running out of chakra. All in All, I will say Naruto has around Mid-Country Level AP.  Let's move on to Ichigo.  Speed  Flashstep was faster than the human eye can register, as Orihime and Uryu both stated that they could not keep up with how fast Ichigo was. The human eye can register up to 38,000mph.  Flashstep was comparable to the speed of lightning. Lightning BOLTS travel at around 1,000,000mph. Bankai times the user's power by 10. 1,000,000 x 10 = 10,000,000. So we can also assume Vasto Lorde Ichigo is around 10 times stronger than his Bankai, likely more. Bankai Ichigo was getting slaughtered with no difficulty by Ulquiorra. Yet Vasto Lorde comes out and fondles him. So it is reasonable to say Ichigo is around 100,000,000mph. Which rounds up to about 1/4 of light speed.  Attack Potency  Vasto Lorde Ichigo had the power to destroy a hole in Hell itself.  Hell is an infinite ever-growing plane. The place houses all of the world's greatest Sinners. There have been a total of 100 billion humans to ever walk the world. A percentage of them are sinners. Anyone who has ever taken a life to of revenge and hate or desire goes to hell. Ichigo blasted a hole through reality itself. This is a UNI+ feat.  Conclusion  Vasto Lorde Ichigo and KCM2 Naruto are equal in speed.  Vasto Lorde Ichigo is a largely greater Ap than KCM2 Naruto.

DACA stands for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. I stress deferred in this.  The way DACA works is based on a concept called prosecutorial discretion. There's a finite amount of resources for prosecutors. You have to prioritize which cases to bother going after.  There was an old retired reserve judge that I was observing once who was judging in the prosecution of a guy for felony possession. Dude had .75 grams of marijuana - basically a few flakes and not enough to roll a joint. He was bumped to a felony because he'd had a prior more than 25 years ago. The reserve judge went off the record for a moment and said, I was out on the lake last night, and I caught a walleye that was exactly 14 inches. [The legal limit for walleye is 14 inches.] I coulda kept it, but it was a little small for me. You know what I mean, counsel? He then went back on the record and said, While we were off the record, the prosecutor agreed that he might be able to come to a better resolution of the case with the defendant and they're going to step out in the hall for a few minutes to discuss that, isn't that right, counsel? with a raised eyebrow.  The whole point of DACA is to stop clogging the system with little fish and go after the big ones first. So, to ensure that they were letting little fish go, the little fish (Dreamers) would register themselves in a database, check in, stay law abiding, be employed, that kind of stuff, to prove that they were staying little fish.  That frees up the government to make sure that they were prosecuting and deporting big fish: MS13 gang members, drug cartel leaders, those sorts.  And it worked. Deportations under Obama skyrocketed and by the time he left office, net migration across the border (people entering vs. people leaving) was at zero percent.  So, it kind of created a tiny administrative agency. Ish.  That's\\u2026 well, a problem.  See, Congress is mostly the one who authorizes things like new agencies. (Side note, this is why the Orange Menace's Space Force is a problem.)  The way that agencies work is that Congress authorizes the Executive Branch to do stuff, and the executive branch then carries that out. Agencies are limited in their actions to what they are authorized to do under the laws passed enabling them.  The mandate for the Department of Justice is really broad. Like enforce the laws of the United States and do whatever you need to in order to do it broad.  And so that's basically the argument that the Obama administration made in creating DACA in the first place, is that this was not really the creation of a whole new agency that totes needs Congressional approval, just a piece of the Department of Justice that was already mandated by Congress and this was a purely executive way of carrying that mandate and existing laws out.  To do this, the Department of Justice made some pretty detailed findings about how this deferred prosecution (not amnesty!) would free up prosecutorial resources to go after the big fish and it would be good for the economy and lots of other stuff required by an administrative agency before starting up a new set of regulations or programs.  The reason they had to do that was because of this thing called the Administrative Procedures Act.   The APA sets out the procedures that an agency has to follow to take certain actions. It provides for a lot of things, including judicial review. The Supreme Court set out a pretty deferential standard for review of agency actions that basically boils down to arbitrary and capricious. That means, that anything short of the agency just going well, we just want to do this thing with absolutely zero forethought, findings, and so forth is considered fine.  Same thing if they want to reverse course on previous stuff from an old administration that the new folks don't like.  On top of that, there's all sorts of budgetary reviews, paperwork reviews\\u2026 there's a list of like 38 hurdles to clear.  (I'm literally hearing the eye rolls from admin law practitioners right now at how much I'm simplifying this.)   So, that brings us to the Orange Menace. Trump neither understands any of of this nor cares. He's used to being a little dictator. He says it, and then a bunch of bootlicking servants go make it happen. Often with questionable legality.  Suddenly, he's in a position where there's all this pesky checks and balances stuff.  So, he thought, and no doubt human colostomy bag Steven Miller told him, that he could just wave his hands and write a little thingy and sign it like a good boy and that would be that.  Except now you have a bunch of people who are affected by this, and who stand to be really harmed by it.  And so, that gives them something called standing to go to a federal court and say, hey, we're going to be really harmed by this unless you put the whole thing on hold. This is called an injunction.  That injunction is stopping the Trump administration from ending the program the way that they were trying to, which was a screeching halt and ICE raids on whomever they had addresses for.  That's because Trump's administration didn't go through the whole process required by the APA. They just tried to flip a switch because they don't like those people.  That's pretty much the definition of arbitrary and capricious.  When asked to defend it in court, the government lawyers that Trump's DoJ sent were basically like, Uh, ahdunno, something something gazpacho DACA shouldn't've been started up\\u2026 squirrel!   In effect, Trump could wind down DACA by following the appropriate regulatory channels. He won't, because it's a great way to fire up the base and throw lots of smoke around and at the end of the day, screwing over the Dreamers is still for the moment a political third rail. And he won't because neither he nor any of his staff around him seem to actually understand how."}, {"upvote": 222, "content": "Hot off the presses. President Trump, on the wall, in his own words.

Tolkien implies that in general, putting on the Ring risks alerting Sauron in some way (unless maybe you were underground or in a Tower, as Sam was)\\u2026 perhaps Sauron becomes generally aware. But if you put the Ring on in the open \\u2014 IN MORDOR ITSELF \\u2014 then Sauron sees exactly where you are and what you're doing. And if you put the Ring on while standing in Mt Doom, where the Ring is at its very greatest power, then Sauron sees everything. Again, the text implies this clearly.  The beautiful passage in the Return of the King states marvelously what happens next. (I'm paraphrasing for now, but I'll go look it up.) From all his plots, from all his designs of war and battle, Sauron forgot about them completely, and instantly directed all of his attention to the little Hobbit standing at the Crack of Doom. Now, for the first time, did Sauron see the true danger he faced. For up until that moment, it never dawned on Sauron in his wildest dreams, that anyone would seek to destroy the Ring.  Now, we also know from Tolkien that Frodo didn't find it very easy to throw the Ring in the fire. But up until that moment, Sauron could never have conceived that anyone would ever go to Mordor with a mission to destroy the Ring. But in that moment in which he perceived Frodo, he suddenly became fully aware of what Gandalf's plans had been all along.  And even though Frodo was going to have a hard time throwing the Ring in, think about this: what if Frodo tripped? What if Gollum snuck up on him, grabbed the Ring, and HE tripped? (Which actually did happen.)  The point is this: with Frodo standing that close to the fires of the volcano, something might have gone wrong before the Nazgul could arrive \\u2014 and as we know, something did go wrong!  Tolkien put it this way:   %3E And far away, as Frodo put on the Ring and claimed it for his own, even in Sammath Naur the very heart of his realm, the Power in Barad-d\\u00fbr was shaken, and the Tower trembled from its foundations to its proud and bitter crown. The Dark Lord was suddenly aware of him, and his Eye piercing all shadows looked across the plain to the door that he had made; and the magnitude of his own folly was revealed to him in a blinding flash, and all the devices of his enemies were at last laid bare. Then his wrath blazed in consuming flame, but his fear rose like a vast black smoke to choke him. For he knew his deadly peril and the thread upon which his doom now hung.  From all his policies and webs of fear and treachery, from all his stratagems and wars his mind shook free; and throughout his realm a tremor ran, his slaves quailed, and his armies halted, and his captains suddenly steerless, bereft of will, wavered and despaired. For they were forgotten. The whole mind and purpose of the Power that wielded them was now bent with overwhelming force upon the Mountain. At his summons, wheeling with a rending cry, in a last desperate race there flew, faster than the winds, the Nazg\\u00fbl, the Ring-wraiths, and with a storm of wings they hurtled southwards to Mount Doom. So, my answer to you is this: Primarily in that one moment, Sauron had extremely strong regrets that he had ever forged the One Ring. As Tolkien tells us repeatedly, it greatly surprised Sauron that the Ring would ever be thrown in the fire.  The other time I think he had a moment of regret is when the Ring was cut from his finger at the end of the Second Age, because that created some difficulties for him.  But even that, as bad as it was, was a temporary defeat. I think that all through the Third Age, Sauron plotted his come-back. He had faith that the Ring would eventually be found and then make its way back to him\\u2026 at which point he could no longer be defeated.  So it was really only at the climax of LOTR that he deeply regretted having made the Ring."}, {"upvote": 371, "content": "Sauron doesn't really have a concept of evil (like most evil people).

If you have have a lot of money, of course, go ahead and buy the best equipment. But even with an unlimited money supply (which you don't have, as you pointed out), I wouldn't do that, because your skill needs to on par with your equipment to get the best out of it. Ok, you can learn from your good new equipment, but if the step is big, the learning curve will be steep too.  Let me illustrate this point with the classical guitars I got. When I started learning playing the guitar, I got an old \\u20ac 50 guitar. I learned how to play songs, but it wouldn't have mattered if I had a very expensive or this cheap one: it was hard pressing the strings anyway. After quite a few years I bought a new classical guitar for around \\u20ac 300. I could feel and hear the difference: it was a perfect upgrade. And a couple of years ago I did another upgrade, with a \\u20ac 700 guitar. I was now skilled enough to not only feel the difference between the cheaper and more expensive guitars, but also to get better songs out of a better instrument.  It's the same with camera's. You can get an expensive camera, but are you already skilled enough to get the most out of it? I'm still shooting with my Canon EOS 100D after a couple of years, for that still is a good enough camera for me. In the meantime I did buy several lenses, got different ND filters, a good tripod, etc, and with those things I get definately better photo's. But I think it will take me a couple of more years before I'm skilled enough for a full frame camera.  I think the best test you can do, is to go to a camera shop, pick up the 5D MIII and see if it feels familiar already, if you understand what the majority of the options will give you, and take a few photo's with your current lens. Take also some photo's with your current camera of the same object (or person), and compare if it is indeed a lot better with the 5D MIII. If you can hardly see the difference, why would you then spend a lot of money? If you can see that you really benefit from this upgrade, then go for it.  The other people already gave the really good advice to invest in some better lenses. You already say that you want to upgrade your lens the coming months: do that first. Learn to shoot with that. And then you can think about a new body (or other lenses: it can be addictive).  Once you are ready for a FF (maybe you could benefit from an entry level first: take baby steps, don't jump into the deep at once), you can also look at the second-hand market. Maybe first get a cheaper second-hand one, so you can learn to use it for a much cheaper price. But if you want a new one, and do have the money for it, consider this: Canon is about to release the 5D mark IV, for about twice the price of a mark III. Maybe you can skip the mark III and go right for the new and good stuff.  So, my advice is: - Check if you are skilled enough to really benefit from such an expensive upgrade. - Buy the new lens you want to buy first and see how much it improves already. Maybe you won't need to spend a lot of money right now. - Maybe go for an entry level FF first, instead of going for the 5D immediately. - If you want a 5D anyway, maybe go for a second-hand: that saves a lot of money, and allows you to practice. - Consider this: the mark IV is about to be released, surpassing the mark III"}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "You should only upgrade when you feel confident you can answer this question yourself.

It's an easy trap to fall into, wanting the new shiny, so be honest with yourself. I personally am tempted to buy a Fuji X-T2, when honestly for the type of photography I do it wouldn't really be that much better than my X-E1. I want it, but I don't really need it."}, {"upvote": 6, "content": "I went from a Canon 7D to a Canon 5Dmk3. For me going to full frame was a massive upgrade, even though the 7D is an excellent camera. I had the 7D for around two years, and learned absolutely everything I could about lenses and my technique. At that point I was then shooting professionally, and starting to hit the limits of the camera. I found that in low light, particularly for video I was getting a lot of noise. For that reason I decided to upgrade.  I disagree a bit with people who say don't worry about your tools, concentrate on your technique and ability. This is true, however the tool you use will at some point impact what you are trying to do. This is especially the case if you are charging money for your work. I have watched another photographer spend hours upon hours in Lightroom and Photoshop editing wedding photos taken using a kit lens and a crop camera. I can shoot on my full frame camera with a good L lens and barely have to do any correction at all. The difference is obvious, and it is real.  I suppose my point is, yes, do upgrade, but do it at the right time. Do it when you know you have hit the limit of your gear and you need something better. I recently saw a post on reddit where a photographer was wanting advice on upgrading from a 5Dmk3 to either a 1Dxmk2 or a 5Dsr. Apart from the fact that those are two very different cameras, there was no real justification for it, other than wanting to spend money because there is something out there that is \\u2018better'.  I think initially it's easy to fall into gear acquisition syndrome, buying lenses and cameras because of reviews online where someone has shot 100 photos against a brick wall. At some point you will know your own gear, know what you like, and know what works for you. This will only come by practice and spending time out shooting photos. I use a Canon 24\\u2013105 f4 IS L for instance. If you look online you will find that lots of people say it's not a great lens. In my case, I actually sold the objectively better 24\\u201370 2.8 to get it. The reality of carrying around a massive heavy lens for my every day shooting just didn't work. The 24\\u2013105 was much lighter, had IS for video, and if I needed to shoot in low light, I just put on one of my lightweight primes. Now if I was shooting weddings all day that might be a different matter, but I'm not.

You can do star photography with the 18\\u201355mm kit lens and Canon EOS 1200D.  Let us take the following things into consideration.  1] Exposure  For star photography, there will be certain limitations on the values of ISO - to avoid noise, and the exposure time - to avoid star trails.  Assuming that you shoot at 18mm to maximize\\u200b the area in the frame, you'll be able to set your aperture at most f3.5 on a 18\\u201355mm kit lens.  If star trails is something you want to avoid then you need to set your exposure time within a certain range. There's a popular rule known as the 500 rule, which states that the longest exposure (in seconds) that you can set before stars start to trail is equal to 500/focal length of your lens. An 18mm focal length on Canon EOS 1200D would be equivalent to 28.8mm on a full sensor camera. So, the longest exposure that you can set without getting star trails is 500/28.8, which is approximately 17 seconds.  Under usual conditions - a dark sky lit with stars, with the settings f3.5 aperture and 17 seconds exposure time, you can achieve the correct exposure at ISO 1600.  This can be your starting point - f3.5, 17 sec, ISO 1600. Make minor adjustments according to the actual conditions.  2] Noise and clarity  Canon EOS 1200D in RAW format and at ISO 1600 and above does produce some amount of noise. However, it can be easily reduced during the post processing and it will not drastically affect the quality of your image.  The 1200D with 18\\u201355mm kit lens does not produce clearest of the images (relative to higher end cameras and lenses), although it works decently and it's good enough.  So considering these things, Canon EOS 1200D with the 18\\u201355mm kit lens can get the job done and shoot decent photographs of stars and the milky way.  Additional things to consider:  Stability is essential to get clear and sharp photographs. You don't want a camera shake, it will totally ruin the image. You will likely need  1. A sturdy tripod - to keep the camera still. 2. A remote trigger - to avoid any direct manual interaction which can possibly move the camera. (Instead, you can use the self-timer hack, however, it works only when the shutter speed is not set to bulb mode) The 1200D alone is no good for star photography. These two things are essential, at least the tripod if not the remote trigger. It would be incredibly difficult or almost impossible to get good photographs without a tripod.

You will need a tripod: If you don't have one rent, buy, borrow, steal\\u2026 Whatever you have to do, do it. Having a tripod is absolutely necessary for Night Photography. If someone says otherwise, good for him/her but you get a tripod. See, I always carry one in my pack!  2. Long Exposure will do the trick: This one is my favorite tip and i almost swear by it. The long exposure technique will give you an immense range. Landscapes, cityscapes, waterscapes you name it and you get it. A remote shutter will help your cause if you don't have it use the self-timer built in your camera. You can thank me later!  3. Look for reflections / glow-signs / advertising / bokeh: When you are shooting at night, especially in a city, you can try to showcase the nightlife. Try and find some random puddle and frame a regular picture with some reflections or slow down the shutter speed. You are bound to get some ohhs & aahhhs!  4. Don't underestimate the power of ISO in your camera: Crank up the ISO, try your hand at street photography in busy areas / market places / shopping malls etc. You will get some noise in the photos but you can use that to your advantage and be creative.  5. Explore advanced photography techniques: The opportunities are endless here, for instance - astrophotography. Shooting the crazy Milky Way or star trails or the big daddy of all - the Aurora Borealis (not sharing any image as I haven't shot anything worth sharing yet. It's kinda bucket list item).  Until then keep shooting. Don't trespass. Carry a head torch. Mosquito repellant, maybe a pepper spray and stay away from the mad dogs and you should be fine. Have fun!

If you're planning on shooting people in low-light situations, but don't want blurring from normal movement, you'll need a camera that's capable of very high iso settings (i.e., a very sensitive sensor). If you want to do still landscapes by moon- or starlight, or city scenes with streaked car lights (or even stars), you'll also need a good solid tripod and a camera that will allow very long exposures (up to several minutes). To avoid blurring these shots when you release the shutter, a cable release or electronic remote shutter release is a good investment. As an alternative, you can also use the camera's self-timer, but that allows very little spontaneity.  You'll also need a good medium focal length lens with a large maximum aperture\\\\f-stop. I suggest at least a 50mm lens capable of an f1.4 aperture (the smaller the f-number, the more light it can let in at its widest setting, but the shallower the focus. Conversely, high f-numbers like 16 or 22 give very deep focus but require much, much slower shutter speeds to allow adequate exposure). My 50mm f1.4 is a very wide lens and produces beautiful bokeh. (For those not familiar with this term, bokeh [boh-KAY] refers to quality of the out-of-focus area\\u2014normally the background\\u2014in a photo where the subject\\u2014normally in the foreground\\u2014is clear).  Bokeh depends on the engineering of the lens (not only the widest aperture, but also the focal length and the number and design of the lens elements), so check out review sites to learn which lenses will give you the effects you want. Be prepared to pay quite a bit for them, even if you buy them used (although used lenses are often fantastic value). And yes, you can still get good bokeh in very low light. Also, the wider your lens angle, the less bokeh you'll get, as wide angle lenses are usually designed to maximize depth of field.  Most importantly, remember that people were shooting great photos more than a century ago, with no guarantee that they'd even recorded images until their film or plates were developed. So shoot as much as you can. If you're using a digital system, examine each shot carefully as soon as you can, and reflect on what works and what doesn't.

There's no built-in Wifi capability, something the 70D added; you have to use an Eyefi card or something similar for wireless access, since Canon hasn't made an adapter for that model. (You're not missing anything. The Wifi adapters Canon does make for their high end cameras that lack it are outrageously expensive.) It lacks the dual-pixel autofocus mechanism that Canon introduced with the 70D. The screen is an old design and doesn't have the 80D's razor-sharp resolution.

Bottom line is that any pro-grade DSLR made in the last 10 years is going to serve your needs perfectly well. Save your money and buy a used 5D mark III ($900-$1200) or even a 5D mark II ($500\\u2013$800). Some reputable dealers for used equipment are B&H, Adorama, Abe's of Maine, KEH, and 42nd Street Photo.  Pair that body with a good general-purpose zoom lens like the EF 24\\u201370 f/4L IS ($900) to start with. The only other must-have accessories you need with that are a circular polarizing filter (around $100) and good tripod. That is a great kit to get you started learning photography.  Save the rest of your money for now until you reach the creative limits of your initial kit\\u2026 You shouldn't buy anything you don't have a specific need for. You might also seriously consider taking some of the money you save and spending it on some photography classes at your local community college.  What your second lens is going to be depends on the direction you go with your photography. My second lens was the EF 100 f/2.8L macro because I was limited in my ability to do flower pictures by not having a macro lens. My next several purchases were lighting gear. I've bought other pieces of equipment over the years to add new capabilities to allow me to do things I couldn't do with the equipment I had at the time. Avoid the temptation to buy things just because they're new and shiny. Every single piece of gear in your collection should fill a specific need (not a want)."}, {"upvote": 5, "content": "Absolutely, 100% yes.  The 5Ds is, in part, designed to be an affordable alternative to medium format cameras and backs, so anyplace you would use a medium format camera you would want at least that resolution.   In a more general sense, the greater the resolution the more options you have for editing an image and making it look really great.  I always want a bigger image, even if I know that 99% of the time I am not going to be selling prints larger than 10x13.  Doing retouching for individual portraits, weddings, seniors, etc., looks more natural if you can edit a large image and then resize it for output, even if the output is 8x10 or 5x7.  If I am doing masks with any level of intricacy my job is made exponentially easier if I have a large image to work with.   Honestly, as a professional, I cannot imagine not wanting that resolution.  The only thing it hurts is my wallet buying more external hard drives and computer upgrades, and the number of options that are opened up for creating high quality (ie. Better than my competition) images is fantastic.   Lastly, the word \\\"necessary\\\" is often very subjective.  Some of my favorite fine art photographers composite low resolution images for fantastic effect, and would not even \\\"need\\\" the resolution of a Canon 10D or a 5 year old Rebel.  Higher resolution does not, of course, always = a great final product, but for many of us it gives us a better starting point, everything else being equal."}, {"upvote": 25, "content": "Yes. The primary difference between it and newer cameras is the image processor and features. The image processors are a minor upgrade (arguable), and newer features are mostly just marketing or efficiency of automation. The features of cameras newer than the 60D tend to be relatively insignificant \\u2013 the 60D functions well enough for anyone with sufficient photographic skills, and any drawbacks can [mostly] be compensated for by hacking it with Magic Lantern or by using alternative techniques and tools. For examples, if a newer camera does auto-HDR, the 60D can be hacked or you can do manual HDR; or if a newer camera has a timer, you can use a $12 intervalometer.  Granted, number of autofocus points, sensor size, and similar features could provide significant advantage. Apples to apples, those are not quite in the same realm of comparison.  The 60D remains a good camera, and will continue to be good for several years.

Natsu frown but he accepted Narutos's desicion, so they give Luffy a net and Luffy set out to Jungle to hunt the Beast.  Next thing is other Ingredients, So Asta was sent to jungle for collecting other ingredients.  Naruto ask Goku to arrange a Big bowl for the Picnic as Goku and Luffy can eat much more, he wanted to have a big pot for cooking. So Goku fly out and came back to earth. He found the biggest pot and fly out for the Picnic spot.  They all are back, Luffy with a big Mammoth. Asta with all kinds of fruits, vegetables, masala etc. As Luffy was poor with Knives, asta helped to skin that big beast. Now Goku set the Pot with some rock below it. Natsu take place below the pot, Naruto used his Rasencook Jutsu to mix that huge chunk of fleshes with all other ingredients. He uses Sage jutsu to arrange water.  Now after the cooking Natsu was all out of fire. Still he wanted to start a cooking competition. So they sat on their places. There are five piles of food.  Natsu managed to eat 12-15 plates of Food.  Naruto eats a lot more 20-30 plates and loses his appetite.  Asta Eats a lot of Food, 1/4th of his pile.  Goku almost had his pile finished.

Aizen's power with the 4 Arts (Kido, Hakuda, Hoho and Zanjutsu) was compared to Aura Michibane from CFYOW Novel. This comparison was made by Kisuke Urahara, who is well known for his intellect and his \\u2018in-person' battle with Aizen. He is a reliable source then, in fact a primary one.  With her Fullbring power, she could block Kisuke's Hado #91, which rivalled or surpassed CFYOW-Grimmjow's Resurreccion Gran Rey Cero.  Grimmjow's base Gran Rey Cero was stronger than Ginjo's Shikai-Getsuga Tensho, according to Giriko's observation.  And this level of power outstrips Barragan by far. So Aura Michibane, who rivals Aizen's Kido, is far beyond Barragan in Power. This means that base Aizen's ability with the 4 Arts is FAR beyond released form Barragan.   We also know that Aizen himself was stated to be FAR above all the Espadas.  Notice the context here: without Kyoka Suigetsu he's still FAR above them. This directly pertains to the answer. From many angles, Aizen out-scales Barragan by miles.   And adding his Intellect and versatility with countless magical spells only makes this even more one sided.

Just to give Yhwach a better fighting chance, I'll even grant him access to the Almighty for the sake of this hypothetical, but it really doesn't affect the outcome. EoS Aizen is a beast.   The main reason this is such a one-sided affair is that Aizen (with most of his seals on) had displayed relativity to later, much stronger variant of Yhwach. Aizen was able to intercept, knock away, and dispel Yhwach's attack aimed at Renji, meaning Aizen's spiritual energy in his attack exceeded that of Yhwach's. He was also able to place Yhwach under Kyoka Suigetsu's hypnosis, while Yhwach was fully on-guard against this ability and in fact activated the Almighty partially as a precaution against it. This is significant because techniques would simply be suppressed by the person they're used on if they were lower in spiritual energy, meaning that Aizen's spiritual energy would scale to this version of Yhwach.  Yhwach at this point had absorbed the Soul King, Mimihagi, and used the Auswhalen to recall all of the Sternritter's power.  He was, in his own words, overflowing with power. Power that he didn't have in his base form. This Yhwach is massively superior to his base self, without a doubt.  Hence, our scaling is -  [code]Aizen ~ SK Yhwach %3E Base Yhwach [/code] B-b-but the Almighty!!!!!! Isn't Yhwach impossible to permanently kill because he can just fart himself back to life? Doesn't he automatically win because he can just write himself a future where Aizen is dead?  Shut up. Also, yes, Yhwach can rewrite himself back to life with the Almighty. But he can't kill Aizen, because Aizen is immortal, and killing an immortal is something of a logical incoherency, since immortals by definition can't die.  Plus, that's not really how the Almighty works. Yhwach can't just alter the future so that Aizen dies through sheer force of will. Rather, Yhwach can perceive all possible futures, and can physically interact with these futures, creating a new causal chain that leads to some desired result.  If Base Yhwach doesn't have the AP to harm Aizen, then it doesn't matter how much he tries in the future, he simply won't be able to kill him. He can't create the cause of Aizen's death, and thus he can't generate that effect.  As for Yhwach farting himself back to life, Aizen would probably just slam him repeatedly until he gives up. In fact, it's possible that Aizen crushes him with his superior spiritual energy, which may completely suppress the Almighty's effects and leave Yhwach dead for good.   EoS Aizen is absurdly powerful. Undoubtedly top 3 in the verse. Base Yhwach doesn't stand much of a chance here. The best he can plausibly do is drag the battle out with the Almighty, so that the fight ends up lasting forever, but in all honesty that doesn't sound like much of a stalemate if all that happens is that Aizen kills Yhwach over and over.

This is hard for a lot of people to grasp, somehow, but the President is not the nation. The President (and the rest of the executive branch) have immense power to make rules, enter agreements, or establish policies on behalf of the nation. But once that rule or agreement or policy happens, it has a life of its own, beyond the President who created it.  DACA, for instance, created an agreement - not an agreement Obama was personally part of - between the United States and the Dreamers. The Dreamer provides the United States certain personal information and proof of good conduct, and the United States provides the Dreamer authorization to work even though they are not a legal citizen.  If you try to terminate that obligation, what do you do with the residual obligations it creates? The Dreamers have taken a risk in giving the United States (and ICE) their personal information, and have relied on an assurance from the United States in building their lives. Is the correct answer to that to say, Well, tough break, and now you're all being deported, because we know right where to find you.  Trump would certainly say yes - he has never met an agreement he wouldn't break for the sheer pleasure of ripping people off. His followers would say yes insofar as they tend to imagine that such arbitrary application of power will only happen to someone else. They're happy when he's hurting the people he's supposed to be hurting.  People who would like our nation as a whole to act more like a responsible adult than like an angry toddler would say no - once the nation has entered an agreement or decided on a policy, the nation ought to only change its stance in a considered way, and with full understanding of, and mitigation of, the consequences.

However others might see this question and actually be interested in an answer, so here you go.  I'm sure there are very few people who are saying that Trump doesn't have the right to cancel a previous executive order by issuing one of his own. However, there are plenty of people who are questioning why he would do so.  Is he doing it simply to play to his fan base?  Is he doing it just to try to roll back yet something else of Obama's?  Is it just another of Trump's petty power plays?  Could it be all of the above?  Obama used Executive Orders to get some things done he thought were necessary, quite simply because he was stymied at every turn by a Republican-held Congress during his presidency and there were no other ways to get some things through.  Trump uses Executive Orders because he thinks he should be the only one allowed to make the laws - even though he too has a Republican Congress. He knows that the law-making process would take too long and wouldn't make the same headlines as an Executive Order does. In just over three years Trump has issued 151 Executive Orders. Obama issued on average 34.5 such Orders a year.  I'm pretty sure however that the premise for your question is faulty - Trump certainly has the right to issue Executive Orders, whether or not it is the right thing to do however, is another thing.

The Obama administration created DACA regulations with the justification that they determined it was good policy.  If the Trump administration made regulations rescinding DACA with the justification that his administration determined it was good policy to end it, they would absolutely have the right to do that. BUT, that's not what they did. The Trump administration tried to make regulations rescinding DACA with the sole reason being that they claimed DACA was illegal, and did not state a policy reason. Because of that, and because questions of legality is for courts to decide, the courts have standing to review whether this justification is correct or not.  Why did the Trump administration not simply use the easy justification that it was because they thought it was good policy, which would not have been subject to legal challenge and have put an end to DACA quickly? Some people believe that the Trump administration did it the way they did on purpose \\u2014 intentionally provoking a legal challenge so that the courts will have to decide whether DACA was legal. Their thinking would be that if they just ended DACA for a policy reason, a future president can re-establish DACA for a policy reason again; but if they got a court to rule DACA illegal, a future president could not re-establish it. So now we end up with the weird situation where they want to end DACA and could end it quickly and easily, but don't, and the whole thing is tied up in an unnecessary legal challenge because immigration hardliners want to try for a bigger win."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "Yes, any Executive Order that did not exist until a president put it into effect should be cancelable by any of his successors, since it isn't a Constitutional Amendment.

In the rest of the world (Asia, Europe, Africa) this camera is marketed as Canon EOS 700D. I live in Bangladesh and I simply call it as 700D. One of my friends went USA last year and bought this camera and he was telling me over phone that he bought a Canon T5i. Hearing this at first I thought What the heck is that? and I asked one of my other friends about it. He replied, Haven't you seen my 700D? That one is the same camera. Then he explained me the matter. Coincidentally he had the same camera and we called it 700D.  So, you see, there's no actual difference between a Canon EOS and Rebel. It's just the nomenclature strategy of Canon.  But keep in mind that only entry level Canon DSLRs are called as Rebel in USA.

I'll only promote the Bleach scans server that we're working on.  https://discord.gg/TUMMcvpHbR And the KSI server too  https://discord.gg/8vAFUtSFQK So onto the answer LMAO.   Before I make this answer, I want to address something.  Ichigo did indeed get his powers back or at the very least his Quincy powers.  Not only that but Ichigo in TYBW got his Zanpakuto basically restored by Tsukushima.  Now, if you pay attention to the first scan for a bit.  He basically made a completely different and alternate past where Ichigo's Zangetsu was never destroyed, think about it like this.  Let's say there's a past, a past that can't change, or anything like that because it already happened, and in front of the past is an infinite amount of possibilities, and as Yhwach states, the future to him appears like sand.  As he states, he can just pluck one grain of sand and change that, so because of that, ALL of those future timelines have been affected by Yhwach, and in basically every since one of them, he's destroy Zangetsu.  So what Tsukushima does, is create an alternate past, where Zangetsu was never destroyed, basically making new infinite timelines that Yhwach has never affected yet.  Basically all of this allows Orihime to revert the sword back to it's original form.   Now to ACTUALLY get onto the answer.  Due to all of this, we can say that EOS Ichigo most likely wins.  He was low end relative to a Yhwach as he was able to harm EOS Ichigo in the fight  Not only that but in the fight, he was able to severely harm Yhwach too  Not only that but Yhwach himself compliments Ichigo  And in fact, he even broke Ichigo's Zangetsu because it might have been overpowered.  Kenpachi is strong in his own right, he's stated to basically be the strongest Soul Reaper  (Won't beat Ichigo but).  Still though, Kenpachi has some good feats, but EOS Ichigo was able to fight Yhwach and be lower end relative to him.  I don't see any way for Kenpachi to win.   So imo, EOS Ichigo wins.

Here are the problems that EOS had only over the last week, because it's permissioned and non trustless.  1. ECAF ordered to freeze the hacked accounts, blockchain isn't immutable. many both inside and outside the EOS community aren't clear what ECAF, the main body tasked with resolving disputes between token holders on the network, is and what control it has over transactions. 2. Dan threw out the constitution because it was socially unscalable 3. RAM over-speculation, it currently costs $14 and growing to create an account. Whales cornered the RAM market. 4. Centralized - just 21 BP's that can vote each other in, plutocracy It takes just 17/21 BP to achieve consensus Block.one, who claimed to have no involvement in the launch of the EOS mainnet are now going to use the 10% of the token supply they own to influence the list of block producers.

An EOS BP is just a corporate-owned server. It can be shut down with a subpoena or by governments However, the biggest problem is simply that EOS is extremely centralized with only 21 consensus nodes and handpicked nodes, while other platforms like Cardano and Elastos are near infinitely decentralized through side-chains/off-chain/horizontal scaling or IOTA and Nano through simply a smart architecture.  It all comes down to being permissioned and non-trustless. That leads to the following, insurmountable problems.  1. 1 person is in charge and can change the constitution at will. This wouldn't be so bad in a trustless and permissionless platform, but wreaks havoc in a non trustless and permissioned platform. Also if it were several people in charge that have to write a constitution, it's even worse, because writing a constitution with many people is always victim of special interests, lobbying and the like. 2. A design that doesn't prevent cartel formation. Cartels always happen if it is possible. 3. If the security of a network relies on 1 person, it can't get mass adoption, because that person has to be perfect. Unfortunately, he isn't perfect, because he has made a very bad constitution. Thus, he isn't really good at that.

Larimer's goal with EOS is to develop a platform for decentralized apps that works the way users want them to.  This results in Ethereum being their main competitor! Compared to Ethereum, EOS is attempting to make it easier to develop dApps. EOS is said to require less code than Ethereum because it has more basic capabilities and is easier to learn how to use and navigate. This is critical because the majority of people lack the technical skills required to utilize Ethereum.

A Canon 80D is currently selling for $999 new for body only.  I'm not a fan of the xxD line after the 60D. My first DSLR was a 40D, and I have a 50D which is still in service as a backup to my 5D mk IV; they are amazing workhorses that produce great imagery. The problem is that starting with the 60D, Canon nerfed/consumerified the xxD line. The real successor to the 50D is the 7D. The 50D and 7D are professional cameras, the 60/70/80D are consumer cameras.  Looking at the latest rumors, the 90D (Preordering now for $1200, available september 12th) is going to be the successor to both the 80D and the 7D mark II. Mechanically the 90d looks more like the 80d than the 7d mark II so it looks like Canon is giving up on having an APS-C professional level DSLR body in favor of a mirrorless system. That's bad news for sports and wildlife photographers with a heavy investment in EF lenses.  Generally I advise people to get used pro grade gear versus new consumer gear. In pro grade gear the emphasis is on quality not useless bells and whistles. So for less than the cost as a new 80D you can get a used 7D mk II, or for a little more get a used 5D mk III. Either of these is going to be a much better long-term investment than an 80D. If you're on a limited budget, you might consider getting a used 7D (mark 1) for around $350 and use the money you save on a top quality lens. Personally, I would go full frame now versus later if you possibly can.  When buying used gear, stick with the top-tier vendors: B&H, Adorama, KEH, and 42nd street photo.

While it doesn't apply at all in the USA, most camera manufacturers (other than Panasonic, far as I know) impose this limit even on North American and Japanese models.  The Nikon D5300 isn't a bad choice for video. It's a few models old, it came out in 2003, the current model is the D5600, so it's may be available for a value price. But this line is a consumer line, APS-C sensor, and not terribly expensive. It can shoot video at 1080p up to 60fps\\u2026 not something you'd need for vlogging, but you want 60p for sports or other action video. Another advantage for vlogging, the D5300 has built-in WiFi, so it can be controlled wirelessly via an app. Most Canon and Nikon can be tethered via USB for remote control, and some have add-on controls, but it's handy to have it built-in.  I have the EOS 6D, and it produces amazing video, particularly in low light, where it blows away my far more expensive dedicated camcorders. The 6D right now is a good bargain, but mostly because everyone expects Canon to announce the 6D mark II Real Soon Now. The 6D also has built-in WiFi.  The EOS 5D mark III is the upgrade of Canon's breakthrough EOS 5D mark II. It's a great camera, one of the go-to standards for video-on-stills camera shooting. But while it's a solid choice if you can afford it, it's not the best choice. For one, it's been superceeded by the EOS 5D mark IV, if you're looking for a higher end model that shoots great video.  Of those on your list, the Canon EOS 80D would be my choice for anyone wanting a strong video option. Like the Nikon, it can shoot a variety of modes up to 1080p60. But the real advantage is in the sensor. This is Canon's second-generation mid-range DSLR with what they call a Dual Pixel sensor. This sensor splits each pixel into two separate photodiodes. Based on the way they're masked, each sensor pair works like a phase-detect autofocus sensor. So unlike every other DSLR on your list, the 80D can give you full performance autofocus in video, and things you usually just find on camcorders and mirrorless cameras, like follow-focus in video, etc. Dual Pixel is also used on Canon's 5D mark IV and all the new Cinema EOS video cameras. And the 80D also has built-in WiFi.  Far as the larger idea of a full camera system goes, you can't really go wrong with either Canon or Nikon. They have the two most complete lines of cameras and two most complete collection of lenses. However, neither offers a mirrorless option. So that means you're only shooting video from the back screen, not the viewfinder. And that only the 80D on your list has fully function video autofocus\\u2026 the others will AF in video, but it's on demand, not continuous, and it's often not very good. The phase detect sensors that DSLRs use are not available with the mirror up, which is what you have in video mode.  For one-person vlogging, keep in mind you are going to want to see yourself, which means either an add-on monitor while shooting or an articulated screen. The 80D and the D5300 both have fully articulated screens which let you see what you're recording from the front of the camera. The others do not, and will absolutely require an external monitor for vlogging."}, {"upvote": 3, "content": "You have to answer yourself one question: Do you want to become a good photographer and learn how to deal with all the photographic options and parameters or do you mainly need a device which delivers you images in a high quality?  The 90D is Canon's top of the line DSLR for advanced amateurs. Canon has far cheaper DSLR cameras which have more or less the same technical capabilities. However, one of the main differences between the 90D and a cheaper 250D is the user interface. Cameras like the 250D are designed to give you good image results in full automatic mode. You CAN control everything manually, but it is harder to do so (because the engineers did not think that typical 250D users will do that very often). Just one example: The 90D has one dial next to the shutter release button which is operated with your index finger - the 250D has the same dial. So when selecting an aperture in aperture priority mode, you do it with this dial. But the 90D has another dial on the back of the camera, which you can operate with your thumb. If you want to over- or underexpose your picture, you can do that with this dial. If you want to shoot in full manual mode, you can set shutter speed with the front dial and the aperture with the back dial. This is intuitive and self explaining. Cheaper EOS cameras (like the 250D) do not have this second dial. If you are in need of an exposure correction, you have to push a button and then set it with the front dial. The 90D has a button for almost every basic camera function, the 250D requires you to dig into a menu to access this function. The 90D has a comprehensive status display on the top of the camera, the 250D requires you to switch on the display for that. And so on.  And now there is the interesting part of the story: This professional user interface is part of any semiprofessional Canon DSLR since at least 2005. So, if you should buy an old EOS 20D from 2005, you get a meager 8 MP sensor and a rather slow autofocus. But you will get a very solid body with the very good, comprehensive user interface - for maybe 70 USD. So, If you want to learn the secrets of photography, I would recommend you one of the semiprofessional two digit EOS models. It does not have to be a 90D for 1,000 USD. You could also start with a very decent 60D, they sell for 250 USD - and it will take you some time to explore the limits of such a camera."}, {"upvote": 3, "content": "No. It's a myth that you will improve your images by trading up to a slightly larger sensor.

So work on seeing the light."}, {"upvote": 6, "content": "If you know what you're doing, use manual. It could give your photo that extra finesse.  In most cases, I prefer to use Av mode, (aperture priority) and adjust it to my shooting conditions. I definitely suggest setting your ISO too, if needed. This will usually give you the feel you're looking for, especially for portrait conditions with ample light. But there are more factors you might need to worry about.  Other times, it's better to use Tv (shutter priority) mode. Other times, it's better to use manual mode.  If the photo looks good, it doesn't matter what mode you use. But getting it to look good may require shooting in a certain mode, or at least make it that much easier."}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-differences-between-Canon-EOS-200D-vs-Canon-EOS-M50", "question": "What are the differences between Canon EOS 200D vs Canon EOS M50", "answers": [{"upvote": 3, "content": "Both of these models are replaced by their successor ,which are the mark 2s .In terms of differences they are same, just that one is mirrorless (the M50),Other is a traditional dslr while the 200d has an ef mounts which has tons of lenses ,the m50 has even more as you can use native m-lenses and also the ef with an adapter ,you can go for the 200d,that will save you some money but I recommend the M50 as soon dslr will be dated.

Do not get this line of thinking stuck in your head because it's not entirely true. In fact, to be honest, this statement is used many times by people who simply can't afford good gear and are jealous at those who can. If you can't afford good gear right now, that's fine; work with what you can afford and save up money to grow into better gear over time. The best camera is always the one you have with you and by this I mean, if you own a $6,500 Canon 1DX and it's sitting at home, your best camera may be the free one that came built into the phone in your pocket!  While it is true, skill is the most important aspect of almost anything, including photography, your gear and even more specifically, your lenses, are just as important. A good lens on an inexpensive camera is always better than a cheap lens on an expensive camera. If you're just starting out and looking for a camera for a beginner, try to think about what sort of photography you'll be doing. General photography such as family photos, photos of your friends, pets, etc.; landscape photography; wildlife photography; street photography, etc. If you don't know yet, that's okay but if you have a goal of developing skills specific to one of these styles, it will help with camera selection.  When getting started, I'd get something inexpensive but not so cheap that your photo quality ends up discouraging you altogether (again, this is where the \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" nonsense kicks in.) I'll cover a couple types and why they're good starter cameras. And with any camera you choose, always try to keep the camera out of \\\"automatic mode\\\" if possible so you begin to master the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  Point-and-Shoot or Camera Phone  These cameras are very inexpensive and with the newer smartphones, the camera is built right in and often takes better photos than the DSLR's from just a few years ago! This is the most inexpensive route to take (and may not cost a penny if you use the camera on your phone) and it helps you learn about composition, lighting, etc. If you're already past this point and want a camera you can grow into, the following are good options:  Traditional SLR's  I know, this is probably not what most people think of when deciding on a beginner's camera but I want to mention it because if you have one of these lying around in your house (parent's or grandparent's old camera, etc.), they're great for learning the basics of a camera with all of the digital stuff removed. SLR (single lens reflex) cameras aren't used much anymore because of the cost of operation, decreased photo quality, and lack of film processing labs, however, I think any aspiring photographer should own or at least use one because they are the \\\"original camera\\\", they are inexpensive, and they help give you a greater appreciation for the luxury of digital photography (not limited to 24-36 photos per roll, immediate results where you can see your photo seconds after taking it, easy and fast multiple frame shooting, and no cost by ruining a roll of film or wasting it on bad photos.) If you buy a traditional SLR 35mm camera, I'd go for something like the Nikon 35mm F2AS with a 50mm \\\"prime lens\\\", or similar. Here's a photo of one of mine:  Digital SLR's  Digital SLR's, or DSLR's, have been the most popular choice for many years now, they're easy to find used, and they're a good starting point in learning photography. These cameras are basically digital versions of the original SLR camera but offer much more flexibility and many more options. Whagt we're seeing right now, however, is a switch from DSLR's to \\\"mirrorless cameras\\\", including the very popular \\\"Micro Four Thirds\\\" cameras which use a smaller sensor, yet often outperform the DSLR's. I'll touch on those, below. Anyway, an inexpensive or used DSLR is a good choice for starting out and I'd recommend an entry level Canon DSLR such as one of the \\\"Rebel\\\" series cameras. I currently use a Canon 1DX which is NOT a beginner's camera, and my old Canon 5D Mark II (this is a great beginner's camera, easy to find, and inexpensive.) Here's a photo of the Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm prime lens attached:  Mirrorless Cameras  These cameras really are \\\"the future of photography\\\" although many professional photographers would scoff at you for even suggesting such a thing because just as it was when SLR's were phasing out, DSLR using pro's often get stuck in their ways and refuse to move with the times. Even today there are professional photographers who refuse to switch from SLR to DSLR! Mirrorless cameras are superior to DSLR's in almost every way: They have higher resolution (megapixels) for a fraction of the cost of DSLR's; there's no mirror flapping around making noise and causing camera vibration; they're smaller and easier to carry, many can shoot 4K and even Cinema 4K video (while Canon and Nikon refuse to adapt and offer this feature for a reasonable price in their DSLR's); and overall, they're less expensive. If you can afford one (they're often cheaper than many new DSLR's), go for it! I currently shoot with a Panasonic Lumix GH4 because I shoot photography AND I need to shoot 4K video and this camera does both. An even less expensive alternative is the Lumix GH3 which sells for around $500, a quarter of the price of the GH4. Here's a photo of the Lumix GH4, a \\\"mirrorless camera\\\":  Regardless of what you choose, unless it's a cheap $30 point-and-shoot or your phone's camera, try to make a decision on which camera format you want to grow into, otherwise you'll be wasting money on a camera and the expensive lenses that you'll end up not using when you switch to a different format.  Taking an introductory photography class or workshop is also a good idea when getting started as you'll more quickly learn the basics including aperture, exposure, shutter speed, composition, and editing. Good luck with your search and your journey into photography!"}, {"upvote": 16, "content": "It's a decent start, but it also tells you a few things about Canon's thinking right now. And I think they made some good decisions, and a few bad ones that may have not been choices as much as technical limitations.  Neither Canon nor Nikon were actually new to mirrorless with last August's introductions. But the R and the Z are professional formats, even if the first models are not a match for the top-of-the-line DSLRs yet. Both Canon and Nikon took on the idea that mirrorless was something less than DSLR, a step between DSLR and compact digital cameras (aka point and shoot). Nikon's 1 system used the same 1\\u2033 sensor size found in high-end P&S cameras like the Sony RX10 and RX100. But Canon put out a very compact APS-C system with their EOS M. And a funny thing happened: while Nikon's 1 system is now defunct, the EOS M is very popular, albeit not necessarily in the USA. Canon's been the #2 mirrorless brand in Japan in 2016 and 2017 (BCN rankings, second to Olympus) and looks to be taking the #1 spot for the 2018 year\\u2026 without even counting the EOS R. Canon seems to have nailed the consumer mirrorless ILC with the EOS M.  So it should be no surprise that Canon got into mirrorless on a higher level with the EOS R, but then again, it should be. Canon is slower to react to competition than just about anyone. Why this, why now? Canon feels the competition.  For most of history since maybe the 1940s or 1950s, Canon and Nikon had much of the professional market for cameras. In the 1960s, led by Nikon, they won an 80% share, and it's been pretty much 80\\u201390% ever since. Canon managed to flip the market share on Nikon by being the first to court consumers, and then by delivering the fastest speeds for pro sports shooters. But for a long time, the only 35mm, then full-frame choice for most pros was Nikon or Canon.  This last year, the whole industry sold only 11.6 million ILCs, less than half of those sold in 2013. And 2017 was actually an 8% increase from 2016. But more the point, DSLRs sold only accounted for 65% of the ILC market\\u2026 clearly, Nikon and Canon were no longer winning an 80\\u201390% share. And while Canon's mirrorless sales were up 70% in 2017, Nikon wasn't even part of that. And of course, neither was competitive with Sony, Olympus, Panasonic, or Fujifilm in higher-end mirrorless. No one knows just where the DSLR vs. mirrorless ratio settles out in the long term, but it's not going to be terribly favorable to any company only making DSLRs.  What's It For?  If you look carefully at the EOS R, like the Nikon Z's, you'll know just what it's for: the EOS R is a mirrorless body for Canon users to buy, so that they don't buy Sonys. This is the big factor. Canon users have been trying Sony A7s with adapters, and liking them. Some keep it as an accessory, but some sell their Canon gear and move to Sony. Canon needs that to stop, and their first reaction to this situation is the EOS R.  Canon's introducing one body and four lenses, two of them quite expensive, but still, that's not a full system for nearly anyone who needs a system camera. It's a start. But if you're already a Canon shooter, the R is with an adapter is going to let you try out mirrorless with all of your glass \\u2014 even EF-S lenses, but EF-M lenses are impossible \\u2014 your existing batteries and flash units, etc. It's a much simpler way to experiment with mirrorless for today's Canon shooter. If you're new to ILCs and want full-frame mirrorless, EOS R won't be a great option for at least 3\\u20135 years, depending on how quickly Canon rolls out new glass.  So you're supposed to compare the EOS R to a Sony A7 Mark III, but the closest match is actually the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV. So you're getting more or less a mirrorless 5D Mark IV with some improvements/extra features for $900 less. That's a pretty fine deal, speaking from the Canon universe. It's a bit more expensive than the A7 Mark III, but no one's more aggressive on body pricing than Sony.  I think it succeeds in its mission. If I still had my Canon system and was ready for full frame mirrorless, the EOS R is a no-brainer versus the Sony. It's not even the cost of the bodies or the minute details of the features, but the fact it's already part of my system. The cheap lens adapter is only $100, and it works perfectly. For a bit more, I could get the adapter with filter holder, simply brilliant for video work.  Video Issues  Alas, on that latter one, Canon's still being Canon, and not in a good way. They're still crippling 4K video on the EOS R, delivering the same 1.7x crop you have on the EOS 5D mark IV. If you're buying a full-frame DSLR for video, the point is to have full frame video. With that crop, you're better off going to a Panasonic GH5 or a Blackmagic Design Pocket Cinema Camera 4K, depending on your needs.  I expect for most stills work, you have a 5D Mark IV as far as the quality goes. You won't quite match Sony in very low light, but you'll have a bit more resolution in bright light, so it's probably not a big deal for most photographers. You'll have the Canon color, which Sony has yet to match, and the Canon menus you're used to\\u2026 well, maybe. They have a few new controls on the camera, which changes around the way its used. There's a programmable ring control on lenses, but you won't run into that with adapted EF lenses unless you get the third adapter, the one with the ring control. There's also a touch strip on the back, which most reviewers aren't yet crazy about.  Neither Sony nor Canon has 10-bit in-camera video, which is what you need for serious Log shooting. But the EOS R does have that as an external option, at least. I'd bet on Sony's A7S Mark III offering 10-bit in some fashion, but like Canon, Sony's got their own cinema camera business they feel compelled to protect by crippling the mirrorless models. Oddly, though, Nikon opted for the same thing, in-camera 8-bit, external 10-bit, even without a video market to protect. I guess that leaves them both with a feature to add to a higher end model, next year. Or save money and buy the GH5 right now.  Conclusions  So basically, I think the EOS R is attractive to anyone with a full Canon system thinking about mirrorless. If Canon's annoying behaviors haven't driven you away yet, this may well be your mirrorless. I don't really find any huge problems with it. Knowing that Sony was the initial target, nothing about the EOS R or the Nikon Zs were particularly unexpected. Both aim for the Sony's, Nikon at both the A7III and the A7RIII, Canon's basically doing the A7III competitor now. I would hope they're holding off an A7RIII competitor until they have some improved sensor tech, probably also going into the EOS 5DS Mark II."}, {"upvote": 3, "content": "That's a very subjective fact.

A lousy photographer will take lousy pictures with great equipment. You have to know how to use the equipment to get the best results.

While an amateur will probably get better pictures with better gear, they won't know how to really make the most of the camera's capabilities. It is probably overkill to just leave a high end camera in full auto mode. Many lower end cameras can get you similar results in full auto. The biggest difference will probably be with the quality of the lenses. You cannot duplicate the images from high end lenses with cheap lenses. This is especially true for controlling depth of field and getting nice soft focus (bokeh).  If you are in the market for a camera, I'd start by establishing a firm budget and talking to some sales people about the best camera you can buy for the type of photography you plan to do. B&H Photo  https://www.bhphotovideo.com/  has some incredibly knowledgeable staff and they carry an incredible range of products. They are very reputable and I have bought a lot of gear from them. You can also try walking into local camera stores, but they can run the gamut from really knowledgeable to just pushy sales people. Places like Best Buy have a fairly limited selection and most of the sales people I've spoken with are not very knowledgeable in terms of camera equipment.  Depending on how serious you are about getting into photography, I'd buy a decent camera body and the best lens I can afford. You probably don't need a super high megapixel camera or one capable of super high shutter speeds and ISO for general photography.

My personal opinion is to ignore the Rebel (old school thinking) and I'm not too impressed by the feel of the M50.

However, it then doubled in less than 24 hours, with EOS hitting $5.40.  This hike did not last, however, and the coin soon started falling, breaking one support level after another. EOS found its bottom at $0.59, which is where it remained until late October 2017. Once the crypto bull run that marked the year reached its peak, EOS joined the rally, and it skyrocketed to $16.39 on January 13, 2018.  However, while most coins peaked around this date or earlier, EOS' all-time high came later, in April 2018. In mid-April, the crypto market \\u2013 which had been crashing since January \\u2013 started seeing a new bullish wave. Prices started going up, and many assumed that the so-called 'crypto winter' was over.  These days, we know that the surge in April was only the eye of the storm, as the crash continued as May 2018 arrived. But, for those few weeks, the EOS price jumped once more, breaking its former record, and going up to $22.89. This was the coin's highest price, and it has never reached these highs again, at least so far.  Following this second surge, EOS kept dropping, briefly stopped by support here and there, but eventually, it dropped to its new bottom at $1.86 around December 7, 2018. In 2019, the coin saw gradual growth, although it progressed slowly, and everything it had achieved by mid-2019 was undone in the second half of the year, as it slowly returned to the level where it sat ever since \\u2013 between $2 and $2.8.  The EOS price has fluctuated in this range, except for on three occasions in 2020. The first one was between mid-January and mid-February, when it joined another bull run that took it to $5.35. The second was in August 2020, when it hit $3.7, and the last one is right now, led by Bitcoin (BTC), which is once again approaching its all-time highs at $20,000.  EOS, on the other hand, is as far away from its own record as it can be, hovering around $3.26.  What is happening to EOS these days?  Unfortunately, EOS has not been making headlines in 2020, as the crypto industry is mostly focused on the decentralised finance (DeFi) sector. When DeFi started slowing down, bull runs took over, and most of the attention went to Bitcoin.  However, that does not mean that EOS has been doing nothing. Its developers at Block.one recently announced the EOS Resource Model proposal, and the soon-to-arrive review of various talented organisations that responded to the company's invitation to evaluate their code.  Block.one also recently expressed its pleasure with how Spielworks built a rewards and loyalty platform for gamers using EOSIO.  The company also worked on adding new features to its Training and Certification segment of the blockchain.  And, of course, as a development platform, EOS has also been making moves to attract people to develop new DeFi projects on its network.

According to TradingBeasts, the EOS price in December 2020 will reach a maximum of $3.4, after which the forecasting service expects it to drop back down to $2.7, on average.  In January 2021, its EOS crypto price prediction shows the coin remaining near this level, at around $2.7, later expecting it to experience a slow but steady rise throughout the year, with the coin having the potential to hit a high of $3.9 next December. The average price of EOS is predicted to reach $4.07 in December 2022, and then $5.03 in December 2023.  Wallet Investor also expects the currency's price to rise in early 2021, although their EOS coin forecast says that the asset will see a price crash in the second half of the year. The event will potentially lead EOS down to $1.2 one year from now.  As for CryptoGround, they have a very bullish EOS prediction. In fact, their EOS forecast claims that the coin will simply keep climbing, with its value reaching $4.17 in six months, $4.7 in one year, and $21.4 by December 2025."}, {"upvote": 17, "content": "EOS has the following unique benefits.  \\u25cf High transaction throughput: EOS enables the execution of millions of transactions per second, which means that it has high transaction throughput.  \\u25cf Free transactions for end-users: EOS provides the users to mine and execute a large number of transactions without any additional fees.  \\u25cf Governance based on user votes: Each transaction executed in EOS is bound to follow the rules laid down in the constitution.

According to the Technical EOS White Paper: The technology behind EOS is a blockchain architecture that scales to millions of transactions per second, eliminates user fees, and allows for quick and easy deployment of decentralized applications. (Source: EOSIO/Documentation [ https://github.com/EOSIO/Documentation/blob/master/TechnicalWhitePaper.md ]).  The CEO of Block.One (Lead developers of EOS), Brendan Blumer, claims that current existing platforms, do not allow the EOS blockchain to achieve massive scale adoption. However, the potential for EOS is huge.  EOS will allow millions of transactions per second. With fees closing in on the zero mark. Parallel processing will greatly increase transaction speeds and therefore help scalability. Think about this: millions of transactions per second.  Ethereum on the other hand, as 5th February 2018, ETH can handle ~9 transactions per second- (800,000 (ETH daily transactions) / 86400 (number of seconds in one day) = 9.26 tps.

It radically alters how we build applications online and makes it possible to applications previously not possible.  Ethereum, one of the most talked about blockchain platforms, is competing to become the next generation foundation for building applications. However, it is now under threat from what has been described as the Ethereum killer.  EOS, is the latest blockchain platform out of the blocks. It is causing a stir amongst blockchain experts, who are super excited by its potential. Analysts say it is will make other blockchain platforms obsolete.  Here are 5 reason why EOS might make Ethereum obsolete  EOS has superior technology compared to Ethereum  EOS was developed after the proliferation of multiple blockchain experiments like Ethereum. All of them attempt to lure in developers, enterprises and users to their platform. Unfortunately, the limits of their technology are a drag on what is possible.  Ethereum, suffers a limitation of transactional throughput. Because of a process known as serialization, transactions on it are limited to being processed sequentially. Therefore, all processes that go through its blockchain, cannot be processed simultaneously. Instead, they have to be processed in the order they are received relative to other transactions.  The EOS platform, recognized this limitation, and solved it by implementing asynchronous communication and parallel processing of transactions. This means multiple transactions running on EOS do not have to queue and wait their turn. Rather, they all get processed together, simultaneously on a distributed network. This is a remarkable feat in transactional capacity.  With this capability, EOS can handle more transactions, scale faster and to a wider audience than what is possible with Ethereum.  EOS can process more transactions per second than Ethereum  For blockchain platforms to become successful, they need to accommodate a ton of traffic on their network. The number of transactions a network can handle per second is a metric for comparing blockchain performance.  At its peak on June 11th, 2017, Ethereum experienced one of its highest traffic on the network. Unfortunately, even at its peak, it could only handle a throughput of 5.2 transactions per second. In the cryptocurrency world, this may seem impressive. However, for commercial grade applications, it is merely a drop in the bucket. With hundreds of banks, governments and major companies looking to build blockchain applications, much more is required.  EOS identified the folly of the current blockchain transaction capacity models. So they have implemented asynchronous communication and parallelization. With parallelization, multiple transactions are processed simultaneously, enabling horizontal scalability of the network. In addition, EOS has adopted Graphene technology, which has been proved to achieve 10,000 - 100,000 transactions per second.  Combining both technologies, EOS can achieve a modest 300,000 transactions per second. But, this is only the beginning. The road map is to scale to process 1 million transactions per second. EOS will support the bandwidth requirements of commercial and enterprise grade applications. For context, facebook and google handle about 52,000 and 40,000 transactions per second respectively.  Mass adoption of blockchains boils down to the scaling ability of platforms. EOS has scalability at the core of its design.  EOS has zero transactions fees while Ethereum's fees are going higher  Blockchain networks typically consume resources for security and processing. The de facto approach has been to pay the owners of resources. Miners collect fees from users to keep the network running. This design however, is detrimental to lowering the barrier of adoption.  The Ethereum blockchain enables developers to build decentralized applications at no cost. The downside is users pay the price for consuming the network's resources. Users of Ethereum applications have to pay fees for every transaction processed by miners. Every storage operation, bandwidth use and calculation has to pay gas fees which is expressed in Ether. The amount of fees is calculated based on the complexity of the transaction.  If users do not pay enough fees, their transactions are excluded. It is worse because fees can change at any time and there is no way to predict in advance.  EOS was built from the ground up to do away with this insane model. To onboard users en mass, it needs to be cheap to use applications on platforms. For this reasons, transactions on EOS incur zero fees. This model eliminates the hassle of purchasing cryptocurrency to pay network fees. Additionally, developers also do not incur any cost to run applications on EOS. All they need, is to hold a certain number of EOS tokens that assures them a preset allocation of bandwidth.  EOS's zero fee approach to onboarding users and developers on its platform is by far superior to Ethereum's pay to use fee model.  EOS's Daniel Larimer has more experience building blockchain versus Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin  Blockchain's are a relatively new technology, that combine decades worth of prior art. It takes years of experience programming in different fields and a big picture view of the future to build one.  Vitalik Buterin, was barely out of high school when he set out to build the Ethereum blockchain. He started out as a cryptocurrency writer for Bitcoin magazine and opted not to go to college. 14 months later, he joined teams working on digital assets protocols - Mastercoin and Coloured coins.  While on these projects, he witnessed first hand the limitation of protocols built on Bitcoin. So he conceived the idea of Ethereum, an independent blockchain in 2014, but lacked the developer skills to build it from scratch. He had to find other developers to help him make Ethereum a reality.  Dan Larimer on the other hand, graduated from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in 2003 with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science. He worked on various projects such as a virtual reality simulator and unmanned vehicle control systems.  In the early days, Dan worked closely with Satoshi Nakamoto refining bitcoin. He realized its shortcomings and moved on to build a high performance decentralized exchange known as BitShares. 2 years later, he built Steemit, a social media site powered by blockchain. Steemit is hailed as the most user friendly blockchain to date.  Dan's ground breaking technology Graphene was used for both Bitshares and Steemit. Both combined have more blockchain transaction activity per day than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitshares processes between 600,000 - 700,000 transactions per day, while Steemit handles 120,000 transactions per day.  As the CTO of EOS, Dan has brought his experience, lessons and technology from previous projects. EOS combines all the great qualities of Bitshares and Steemit to come up with a superior blockchain platform.  Final Thought  People don't realize that there are other ways to earn great profits on cryptocurrency rather than just buying them. For example, investing with trusted Non-Ponzi cryptocurrency investment companies for profits, companies like Cryptobond (www.cryptobond.tech) pay double your cryptocurrencies (Ethereum, EOS and others) in 7 days of investment, isn't that great?  Developers, entrepreneurs, Banks, fortune 500 companies and governments have expressed interest in building blockchain applications. Current blockchain platforms such as Ethereum are limited in scalability, fees and throughput. They were not designed from the ground up with commercial applications in mind. Attempting to do the major changes necessary now is like trying to disassemble an engine while it is running  EOS is building a blockchain platform for scale, ease of use and millions of transactions per second. It is incorporating the lessons and failure of existing blockchain models. With an eye on the future of commercial adoption, EOS has a leg up on Ethereum, by building to remedy the failures."}, {"upvote": 3, "content": "Ethereum, being a blockchain, has been enduring a problem common to all blockchains \\u2014 the size of the database underlying the blockchain grows without bounds, and in direct proportion to the number of people using the blockchain. What this translates to is major overhead and challenges that are getting worse over time for the underlying infrastructure needed to run Ethereum. For example, the Ethereum database has grown over the last few years from being under a gigabyte to tens of gigabytes today and it appears to be growing on an exponential trajectory. This is clearly not sustainable.  The key technology we believes is the solution is sharding, a term borrowed from database technology,where the data is sharded and the network is partitioned. Briefly, sharding consists of three steps:  1. Break up the data into small chunks (also called shards) 2. Partition the network into subnetworks (Bluzelle calls each a swarm. we calls each a universe) 3. Distribute the shards into the swarms if properly executed, it will enable Ethereum to scale well past the size limits it is facing now. The execution specifics of how the subnetworks will intercommunicate remains a subject that undoubtably we are actively working on.  The Bluzelle database was architected from the get-go to employ three key technologies, one of which is database sharding. Bluzelle accomplishes massive scalability by sharding all database data and then ensuring shards get properly stored into Bluzelle's own flavour of network partitions \\u2014 swarms. A Bluzelle swarm is a collection of nodes that all replicate the same shards of data. All these nodes are part of a unique network that Bluzelle defines as a swarm.  Bluzelle's swarm is analagous to our universe. Bluzelle database shards are analagous to the small chunks of the Ethereum network that get assigned to an Ethereum universe.  The Bluzelle architectural design, while being a database, is conceptually exactly the same as what Ethereum aims to be in the distant future. Today's announcement is a strong validation statement about Bluzelle's own design and direction. It exemplifies how one of the largest and fastest growing blockchains intends to use the same principles as Bluzelle, to achieve mass scalability.  Interestingly, there is industry belief that SHARD means System for Highly Available Replicated Data, an acronym that very accurately depicts Bluzelle  "}, {"upvote": 9, "content": "You could say it has 1 advantage with more scalability, but at a heavy price, because it chose to be permissioned and non-trustless instead of permissionless and trustless.

It all comes down to being permissioned and non-trustless. That leads to the following, insurmountable problems.  1. 1 person is in charge and can change the constitution at will. This wouldn't be so bad in a trustless and permissionless platform, but wreaks havoc in a non trustless and permissioned platform. Also if it were several people in charge that have to write a constitution, it's even worse, because writing a constitution with many people is always victim of special interests, lobbying and the like. 2. A design that doesn't prevent cartel formation. Cartels always happen if it is possible. 3. If the security of a network relies on 1 person, it can't get mass adoption, because that person has to be perfect. Unfortunately, he isn't perfect, because he has made a very bad constitution. Thus, he isn't really good at that.

Are you sure you didn't confuse the blockchain size with the storage needed by an archive node?  An archive node stores snapshots of the account states at every block height. So, for example if there was a transaction that increments somebody's token count by some amount, an archive node instead of just changing the number in the state storage, it will make a copy, so that you can later run queries like what was the balance of address X at block height Y. Basically, you can rewind to any previous time and see the state as it was back then.  TL;DR: Most of those 7 TB are generated locally by the archive node, they aren't part of the blockchain.  In contrast, normal nodes just execute whatever is in the blocks, updating one copy of the state. If you don't keep multiple copies, you only need around 422 GB (as of now):  https://etherscan.io/chartsync/chaindefault If instead you're happy with just getting a copy of the latest state and some block headers and transaction receipts (called fast sync), this can be further reduced to 130 GB:  https://etherscan.io/chart2/chaindatasizefast And, of course, if you just want a wallet, and aren't interested in running a block explorer, then you can just do a light sync, which is only some MB, it should be done in minutes (it only downloads block headers, no block data, no state - and asks other nodes to send it transactions that match given hashes and stuff, so that it can find its own transactions)."}, {"upvote": 3, "content": "Scalability in blockchain refers to the constraints a blockchain has in comparison to other established solutions or how its adoption is limited.

Outside of that, there is little reason for concern. The rating is not a reflection of a hard limit in the camera, it is simply a rating for how long the shutter is expected to last. Sometimes they fail sooner due to some unforeseen damage. Sometimes they last well beyond that rating. Most people will never have a camera long enough to have to even worry about hitting it. They either replace the camera well in advance, or they just don't use it enough. For scale, I once had an 80D that I sold after two years of really putting it to use for sports and wildlife, as well as events and portrait work. It had 18,000 shots on the shutter when I sold it. At that rate, it would have been 10+ years to hit the 100,000 shutter rating on the camera. That's as a pretty serious user too, a casual user probably doesn't even take 18,000 shots in 10 years.  I would bet YouTube is to blame for why all the sudden everyone has become so conscious of this. Just like with dynamic range and low light performance, I think people hear about these things as some kind of measurable thing, and then they always want to know them so they can compare things to each other without really having practical knowledge of why they matter or how much they matter. Not saying that is what is going on with this question, just saying in general I keep having to answer questions about this thing that not that long ago nobody really seemed to even care about."}, {"upvote": 10, "content": "It's pretty difficult a choice between having dhosa or pizza for lunch.

Not only is the 1D X around $6,000 (body-only), but you're going to need expensive CFast cards for 4K video, and the 4K video on the thing is in gigantic Motion JPEG files, and not all that amazing anyway. If I wanted a 4K camera for video, I'd recommend either get a Panasonic GH4 or perhaps a Sony A7s mark II.  The Nikon D80 (2006) and the D3 (2007) are ancient models and don't shoot video. The D3s does shoot video, but only 720p, not full HD.  The EOS 7D (2009) is also fairly old. It can shoot 720p or 1080p video, but only 12 minutes at a time. The others here can shoot 29\\u203259\\u2033 without stopping \\u2014 that's a limit set to avoid paying a European camcorder tax. While it doesn't apply at all in the USA, most camera manufacturers (other than Panasonic, far as I know) impose this limit even on North American and Japanese models.  The Nikon D5300 isn't a bad choice for video. It's a few models old, it came out in 2003, the current model is the D5600, so it's may be available for a value price. But this line is a consumer line, APS-C sensor, and not terribly expensive. It can shoot video at 1080p up to 60fps\\u2026 not something you'd need for vlogging, but you want 60p for sports or other action video. Another advantage for vlogging, the D5300 has built-in WiFi, so it can be controlled wirelessly via an app. Most Canon and Nikon can be tethered via USB for remote control, and some have add-on controls, but it's handy to have it built-in.  I have the EOS 6D, and it produces amazing video, particularly in low light, where it blows away my far more expensive dedicated camcorders. The 6D right now is a good bargain, but mostly because everyone expects Canon to announce the 6D mark II Real Soon Now. The 6D also has built-in WiFi.  The EOS 5D mark III is the upgrade of Canon's breakthrough EOS 5D mark II. It's a great camera, one of the go-to standards for video-on-stills camera shooting. But while it's a solid choice if you can afford it, it's not the best choice. For one, it's been superceeded by the EOS 5D mark IV, if you're looking for a higher end model that shoots great video.  Of those on your list, the Canon EOS 80D would be my choice for anyone wanting a strong video option. Like the Nikon, it can shoot a variety of modes up to 1080p60. But the real advantage is in the sensor. This is Canon's second-generation mid-range DSLR with what they call a Dual Pixel sensor. This sensor splits each pixel into two separate photodiodes. Based on the way they're masked, each sensor pair works like a phase-detect autofocus sensor. So unlike every other DSLR on your list, the 80D can give you full performance autofocus in video, and things you usually just find on camcorders and mirrorless cameras, like follow-focus in video, etc. Dual Pixel is also used on Canon's 5D mark IV and all the new Cinema EOS video cameras. And the 80D also has built-in WiFi.  Far as the larger idea of a full camera system goes, you can't really go wrong with either Canon or Nikon. They have the two most complete lines of cameras and two most complete collection of lenses. However, neither offers a mirrorless option. So that means you're only shooting video from the back screen, not the viewfinder. And that only the 80D on your list has fully function video autofocus\\u2026 the others will AF in video, but it's on demand, not continuous, and it's often not very good. The phase detect sensors that DSLRs use are not available with the mirror up, which is what you have in video mode.  For one-person vlogging, keep in mind you are going to want to see yourself, which means either an add-on monitor while shooting or an articulated screen. The 80D and the D5300 both have fully articulated screens which let you see what you're recording from the front of the camera. The others do not, and will absolutely require an external monitor for vlogging."}, {"upvote": 12, "content": "New and a DSLR in hand. Nice.

ECAF ordered to freeze the hacked accounts, blockchain isn't immutable. many both inside and outside the EOS community aren't clear what ECAF, the main body tasked with resolving disputes between token holders on the network, is and what control it has over transactions. 2. Dan threw out the constitution because it was socially unscalable 3. RAM over-speculation, it currently costs $14 and growing to create an account. Whales cornered the RAM market. 4. Centralized - just 21 BP's that can vote each other in, plutocracy It takes just 17/21 BP to achieve consensus Block.one, who claimed to have no involvement in the launch of the EOS mainnet are now going to use the 10% of the token supply they own to influence the list of block producers.

How they got in the position they are in is pretty obvious \\u2013 they had a lot of tokens (or access to them) and voted themselves in. It's a whales' election. 5. BPs are already forming cartels.

It all comes down to being permissioned and non-trustless. That leads to the following, insurmountable problems.  1. 1 person is in charge and can change the constitution at will. This wouldn't be so bad in a trustless and permissionless platform, but wreaks havoc in a non trustless and permissioned platform. Also if it were several people in charge that have to write a constitution, it's even worse, because writing a constitution with many people is always victim of special interests, lobbying and the like. 2. A design that doesn't prevent cartel formation. Cartels always happen if it is possible. 3. If the security of a network relies on 1 person, it can't get mass adoption, because that person has to be perfect. Unfortunately, he isn't perfect, because he has made a very bad constitution.

EOS and Ethereum are the world's two largest blockchain projects when it comes to Smart Contracts. Ethereum wants to decentralize world computing and EOS wants to run fast decentralized applications or DApps.  Although these two platforms are similar and try to achieve similar goals, they do so in different ways. The main thing that you need to know is that EOS compromises on decentralization for improvements in scalability as well as lower transaction fees.  Scalability is the problem I think everyone hears about often. Scalability is the ability of a cryptocurrency to cope with the influx of a large number of transactions at a time. Ethereum can make up to fifteen transactions per second, but EOS beats it with a remarkable 10.000 transactions per second. This is a big difference and therefore gives a big advantage to EOS.  Transaction Costs - Ethereum is a platform where every transaction costs gas. The transaction complexity and network volume can affect the price. EOS works efficiently as the transaction costs are non-existent by comparison. Users lease their tokens in order to cover the bandwidth to pay for a transaction and instead of spending ETH, it is possible to recoup the token coverage when the user decides that they do not want to provide the transaction by selling tokens.  These are some essential advantages EOS has. One more thing I would like to mention is that EOS is more flexible due to these advantages and that itself can make EOS indispensable in the Web 3.0 era [ https://dailycoin.com/why-eos-might-actually-survive-web-3-0/ ]. Also, the other things that can complement the chief concerns of Web 3.0 are:   * EOS was designed to make the development of decentralized applications (dApps) easier for developers and dApps are one of the most important themes of Web 3.0.  * EOS makes use of the latest blockchain security protocols that are compliant with regulatory frameworks of Web 3.0. A combination of these factors will help EOS navigate the uncertainties that may happen after Web 3.0 goes public, so that is the advantage EOS will have over Ethereum in the close future."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "nothing right now and no proof, just speculation, it will over-take ethereum.

It radically alters how we build applications online and makes it possible to applications previously not possible.  Ethereum, one of the most talked about blockchain platforms, is competing to become the next generation foundation for building applications. However, it is now under threat from what has been described as the Ethereum killer.  EOS, is the latest blockchain platform out of the blocks. It is causing a stir amongst blockchain experts, who are super excited by its potential. Analysts say it is will make other blockchain platforms obsolete.  Here are 5 reason why EOS might make Ethereum obsolete  EOS has superior technology compared to Ethereum  EOS was developed after the proliferation of multiple blockchain experiments like Ethereum. All of them attempt to lure in developers, enterprises and users to their platform. Unfortunately, the limits of their technology are a drag on what is possible.  Ethereum, suffers a limitation of transactional throughput. Because of a process known as serialization, transactions on it are limited to being processed sequentially. Therefore, all processes that go through its blockchain, cannot be processed simultaneously. Instead, they have to be processed in the order they are received relative to other transactions.  The EOS platform, recognized this limitation, and solved it by implementing asynchronous communication and parallel processing of transactions. This means multiple transactions running on EOS do not have to queue and wait their turn. Rather, they all get processed together, simultaneously on a distributed network. This is a remarkable feat in transactional capacity.  With this capability, EOS can handle more transactions, scale faster and to a wider audience than what is possible with Ethereum.  EOS can process more transactions per second than Ethereum  For blockchain platforms to become successful, they need to accommodate a ton of traffic on their network. The number of transactions a network can handle per second is a metric for comparing blockchain performance.  At its peak on June 11th, 2017, Ethereum experienced one of its highest traffic on the network. Unfortunately, even at its peak, it could only handle a throughput of 5.2 transactions per second. In the cryptocurrency world, this may seem impressive. However, for commercial grade applications, it is merely a drop in the bucket. With hundreds of banks, governments and major companies looking to build blockchain applications, much more is required.  EOS identified the folly of the current blockchain transaction capacity models. So they have implemented asynchronous communication and parallelization. With parallelization, multiple transactions are processed simultaneously, enabling horizontal scalability of the network. In addition, EOS has adopted Graphene technology, which has been proved to achieve 10,000 - 100,000 transactions per second.  Combining both technologies, EOS can achieve a modest 300,000 transactions per second. But, this is only the beginning. The road map is to scale to process 1 million transactions per second. EOS will support the bandwidth requirements of commercial and enterprise grade applications. For context, facebook and google handle about 52,000 and 40,000 transactions per second respectively.  Mass adoption of blockchains boils down to the scaling ability of platforms. EOS has scalability at the core of its design.  EOS has zero transactions fees while Ethereum's fees are going higher  Blockchain networks typically consume resources for security and processing. The de facto approach has been to pay the owners of resources. Miners collect fees from users to keep the network running. This design however, is detrimental to lowering the barrier of adoption.  The Ethereum blockchain enables developers to build decentralized applications at no cost. The downside is users pay the price for consuming the network's resources. Users of Ethereum applications have to pay fees for every transaction processed by miners. Every storage operation, bandwidth use and calculation has to pay gas fees which is expressed in Ether. The amount of fees is calculated based on the complexity of the transaction.  If users do not pay enough fees, their transactions are excluded. It is worse because fees can change at any time and there is no way to predict in advance.  EOS was built from the ground up to do away with this insane model. To onboard users en mass, it needs to be cheap to use applications on platforms. For this reasons, transactions on EOS incur zero fees. This model eliminates the hassle of purchasing cryptocurrency to pay network fees. Additionally, developers also do not incur any cost to run applications on EOS. All they need, is to hold a certain number of EOS tokens that assures them a preset allocation of bandwidth.  EOS's zero fee approach to onboarding users and developers on its platform is by far superior to Ethereum's pay to use fee model.  EOS's Daniel Larimer has more experience building blockchain versus Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin  Blockchain's are a relatively new technology, that combine decades worth of prior art. It takes years of experience programming in different fields and a big picture view of the future to build one.  Vitalik Buterin, was barely out of high school when he set out to build the Ethereum blockchain. He started out as a cryptocurrency writer for Bitcoin magazine and opted not to go to college. 14 months later, he joined teams working on digital assets protocols - Mastercoin and Coloured coins.  While on these projects, he witnessed first hand the limitation of protocols built on Bitcoin. So he conceived the idea of Ethereum, an independent blockchain in 2014, but lacked the developer skills to build it from scratch. He had to find other developers to help him make Ethereum a reality.  Dan Larimer on the other hand, graduated from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in 2003 with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science. He worked on various projects such as a virtual reality simulator and unmanned vehicle control systems.  In the early days, Dan worked closely with Satoshi Nakamoto refining bitcoin. He realized its shortcomings and moved on to build a high performance decentralized exchange known as BitShares. 2 years later, he built Steemit, a social media site powered by blockchain. Steemit is hailed as the most user friendly blockchain to date.  Dan's ground breaking technology Graphene was used for both Bitshares and Steemit. Both combined have more blockchain transaction activity per day than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitshares processes between 600,000 - 700,000 transactions per day, while Steemit handles 120,000 transactions per day.  As the CTO of EOS, Dan has brought his experience, lessons and technology from previous projects. EOS combines all the great qualities of Bitshares and Steemit to come up with a superior blockchain platform.  Final Thought  People don't realize that there are other ways to earn great profits on cryptocurrency rather than just buying them. For example, investing with trusted Non-Ponzi cryptocurrency investment companies for profits, companies like Cryptobond (www.cryptobond.tech) pay double your cryptocurrencies (Ethereum, EOS and others) in 7 days of investment, isn't that great?  Developers, entrepreneurs, Banks, fortune 500 companies and governments have expressed interest in building blockchain applications. Current blockchain platforms such as Ethereum are limited in scalability, fees and throughput. They were not designed from the ground up with commercial applications in mind. Attempting to do the major changes necessary now is like trying to disassemble an engine while it is running  EOS is building a blockchain platform for scale, ease of use and millions of transactions per second. It is incorporating the lessons and failure of existing blockchain models. With an eye on the future of commercial adoption, EOS has a leg up on Ethereum, by building to remedy the failures."}, {"upvote": 291, "content": "In 2009, Bitcoin was introduced and not many people knew about it. Over time, when people learned about the decentralization from fiat money, they learned they can be more free. No more worrying about your money being frozen from big banks and intermediaries like PayPal. You are your bank now. However, Bitcoin got much bigger than most people thought and it did that very fast. With its increase in price so quickly, it has suffered an increase in transaction fees and also a slowdown in its transaction speed. However, it is still useful. When Ethereum came out, it was looked down upon because the market hadn't matured yet. No one understood much about cryptos beyond the peer to peer transfer. When the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum was established, that is when we had a surge of the altcoin rush. This caused prices to skyrocket on all altcoins. It seems as if the roles have been reversed and there is more doubt on Bitcoin than anything else. This is why we recommend you hodl Ethereum over Bitcoin.  Before i continue, let me introduce you to a platform i discovered where you can sell your Bitcoin and other top Cryptocurrencies at the exact rate in dollars any where in the world.

You sell and get your money directly sent to your bank account immediately your deposit is confirmed. You can also sell and request the money is sent to someone else. Thank me later after using this platform.  What is Bitcoin Used for?  With Bitcoins increase in price, it has been dubbed as gold 2.0 because of its store of value like feature. It is the most expensive cryptocurrency and it actually has the highest market cap. Bitcoin has also been the most resilient. It has the ability to drive the market up or down. If people start taking money out of Bitcoin, expect the whole market to come down. The vice versa also happens. With Bitcoins recently mempool always being full along with the transactions being so expensive, people are looking for other routes. There are upgrades that are expected to fix this but it doesn't seem like it will be here anytime soon. This is called Lightning Networking and it will have an effect on many other cryptocurrencies too.  What is Ethereum Used for?  Ethereum was created by Vitalik Buterin and released in 2015. It is an open source public blockchain that lets people build on the blockchain. It can also be used a digital currency which it is at times. For example, if you decide to create an ICO with your own tokens, you will want people to buy your tokens somehow. You are thinking with a credit card but in cryptocurrencies, ICO's are traded and paired with Ether usually. This means 1 eth is equal to a certain amount of your tokens. You must send your eth to a specific ICO address and receive your tokens that way. This is becoming bigger and bigger as more companies are looking to raise capital through the crypto markets rather than venture capital.  Why Ethereum will do better in the long term?  The future of ethereum contains a lot more hopes than Bitcoin does. Creating another Bitcoin is much easier than it is creating an ethereum that is running efficiently. We have many other coins that are working better as a peer to peer transfer of digital currencies like Litecoin and Vertcoin. We have been seeing Bitcoins dominance in market cap dropping down and with Ethereums market cap going up. The new Weiss Ratings increased confidence in Eth also.   * More use cases: Ethereum has many more use cases than Bitcoin does. Not only can you use it as a peer to peer transfer but you can also use it to create your own ICO. It is even used to put data onto the blockchain.  * Platform for ICO's: You cannot just create your own cryptocurrency and expect it to run efficiently. This is especially true if you're looking to do specific with your cryptocurrency than what is already being done. Cryptocurrencies with open source codes can be coped and started by another company but having the ability to have it on a platform that is already one of the best is hard.  * Mining to Staking: Ethereum has said they will be looking to move over from mining to staking as it is much more efficient and secure. Mining is the use of specific hardware that is used to confirm transactions on the blockchain. Staking also confirms transactions however it is done keeping your tokens or coins in your wallet.

So I'm reviewing based on my own potential use, and trying to explain some of the pros and cons maybe beyond that deal breaker mis-feature.

Or argue, politely. Or to correct errors \\u2014 these are all new, and I've only had so much time to digest the specs.  New Buyer  So first off, if you're a new buyer, with no current camera system, you have only one choice in a mirrorless full-frame system: the Sony Alpha. Your choice, really, of the A7III, the A7RIII, or the A7SII. The reason for this is simple: glass. Sony's lenses are bit pricey, but they have an ok selection. Canon is introducing four lenses with the EOS R. Two of them cost more than $2,000 each. Nikon is only introducing three Z lenses. Neither of these systems will be good for new users.  Nikon/Canon User  If you have a large investment in Nikon F glass, one of the Z models is probably your best bet, simply because it'll work best with your existing gear. Same with Canon, if you have a large investment in Canon EF glass, go with the EOS R. In both of these cases, you already have your existing DSLRs, they don't necessarily vanish overnight. So you're adding cameras that already work with your lenses (via adapter), your batteries, you dedicated flash, etc.  This is, of course, the point of these three cameras. Canon and Nikon could kind of ignore the mirrorless world when it was APS-C and m43 only. There were plenty of Canon/Nikon pros who just wouldn't touch any of those cameras \\u2014 a real shame, particularly if you're a still shooter missing out on Fujifilm or Olympus gear. But anyway, once Sony came along, plenty of Canon and Nikon pros were tempted to buy an A7 and a Metabones, just to try mirrorless. Some haven't been seen by Nikon or Canon since. The goal of these cameras is to establish new system camera lines, sure. But also to keep Sony from meeting their pledge to be the top ILC maker by 2021.  Still Shooter: Canon  So looking at it another way, what are you going to do with these? Again, as mostly a still shooter these days, I love my Olympus cameras, particularly the Pen F, and they didn't exist I'd probably have a Fujifilm camera. But those are not on your list.  The Canon EOS R seems good here, but I have issues with it. The 30 megapixel sensor is a bit more sensor for the price than the Nikon Z6 or the Sony A7III, resolution-wise. But Canon's about two generations behind Sony's stacked BSI technology and one generation behind BSI. So they lose a bit on DR compared to Sony and Nikon. The only point in going to full frame for me would be to maximize dynamic range. So I'm not loving the R here.  Worse yet, no IBIS. That's a personal preference, of course, but I love my IBIS. Here's a Pen F shot handheld at about 2.5 seconds. I couldn't get that with my old and sold EOS 6D, I can't get this with an EOS R. So for me, this is a dealbreaker.  It's kind of a mystery why Canon didn't include IBIS. Even Fujifilm has an IBIS system in one of their cameras. Sony and Pentax made it work full-frame. But here's the thing: except maybe for the Nikon Z's, every other IBIS system has been with Sony-made sensors, I think: Olympus, Panasonic, Pentax, Sony of course, and maybe Fujifilm. It's more difficult to cool a sensor chip in an IBIS camera. Is Canon so far behind they can't make an IBIS full-frame camera? At least one Canon rep claimed it was simply that Canon makes the best OIS and they're going with that. But both Olympus and Panasonic (not sure about the others) have shown hybrid OIS/IBIS works even better than IBIS along, particularly for long focal length lenses. So I don't quite buy that.  Other little bits of detail, if you're still not scared away. The EOS R has a feature every mirrorless ought to have: when you remove the lens, the shutter closes to protect the sensor. It's pretty slow at burst shooting for a mirrorless, at 8fps. And that's only if you're focus-locked. Otherwise, it's about 5fps. You get 47 shots in a buffer, not too bad for a non-pro model. There is a weird dual pixel RAW mode that actually stores twice the normal data, for special purpose processing, and it can go forever to memory, but only at around 2\\u20133fps.  Like most mirrorless, it's got an electronic-shutter silent mode, but only single shot, no burst. It's got a bunch of similar weird limitations. Most of these are fixable in firmware. And it's been traditional among mirrorless companies to not only fix bugs but add new features with new firmware updates\\u2026 but Canon to date has only rarely done that.  Canon has long had their dual pixel sensor technology for on-chip PDAF, in Cinema EOS, in various DSLRs for video use, and in the concumer-only EOS M line for mirrorless autofocus. It's excellent, fast, accurate, and in this model, it covers the entire sensor. That said, there are some weird limitations on the use of AF. For example, it has eye-tracking AF, but only in single-shot mode, again. These issues all support Anton Magus' [ https://www.quora.com/profile/Anton-Magus ]s observation that, even as late in the mirrorless game as these were (10th Anniversary), they were in at least some ways rushed to market. The software is always the last part to be finshed, and this sort of project probably uses Agile Development \\u2014 better to leave out features than to release everything, but half of it's too buggy to use.  The single SD card slot might be disqualifying to some pros. Canon will of course say, well, it's not a camera for pros. But spec-wise, it's basically an EOS 5D Mark IV \\u2014 isn't that considered a pro camera by Canon? That one's got two cards, albeit a mix of CF and SD. And as Jared Polin said, In the right hands, any camera is a professional camera.  I know it's a religion, but Canon is on the side of goodness and light in their fully articulated back screen, as opposed to the tilt screens used on Sony and Nikon cameras. Those are truly evil. Canon's got a very high resolution viewfinder and back screen with high referesh rate. Those are not their problem.  Canon put two generic control wheels on the right, a new, odd control bar on the back, and every lens has a generic control ring. That's not a bad set of controls. As an Olympus user used to having everything programmable, it's about time other companies caught on! However, one of the big contraversies on the internet, as foolish as this seems, is the lefthand knob. That's the on-off switch. Apparently, even with the top-panel display, this is wasted space.  As an Olympus Pen F user, I have to disagree. A good on-off switch is a winner! Ok, sure, the EOS R doesn't have enough knobs, levers, and dials, but Canon always does that! At least now they're programmable!  Like the Pen F, the EOS R is not weather sealed, neither, apparently, are the R lenses. My OM-Ds and several of my lenses are, and while that's not an everyday need, it's important when you do need it. Ok, again, sure, right, not a pro model. But for $2300, that's another thing I'd expect.  Still Shooting: Nikon Z6 or Z7  I'm not sure it's quite fair to include the Z7 in this, as it's about $1,000 more than the EOS R and really comparable to the Sony A7R Mark III. So I'm going to concentrate on the Z6, which is priced exactly the same, at almost $2000, as the A7 Mark III that is clearly its target.  The Z6 \\u2026 kind of ugly. That fake prism just looks like it wants to bite me. Not sure I trust this camera's motivations. But at least they did something useful with that left-hand dial.  The sensor is pretty good, at 24.7 megapixels and based on a fairly modern BSI design. They call is a 'Nikon-designed' sensor, possibly from the same TowerJazz relationship that was rumored to have delivered the D850's sensor\\u2026 only that sensor now seems to have actually been made by Sony. But made by Sony isn't the same as designed by Sony. It's quite possible that Nikon is working, maybe with a partner, on the full sensor design and using Sony to fabricate the part, much as Apple's used Samsung to make some of their A-series chips. After Sony's reorganization, Sony Semiconductor Solutions is more likely to do this, out of the eye of Sony's camera division. Anyway, while not a stacked sensor, this is pretty acceptably modern from all indications.  And the camera has IBIS. I have not read about any specific results with Nikon's first IBIS system, but it's a normal 5-axis system, so it could be as good as Sony's, if not necessarily as good as Olympus has. That removes the other deal killer I had with Canon's EOS R, and you have that for a few hundred bucks less.  So when Sony made the A7 series, they took the ~1000whr FW50 battery used in their APS-C compact mirrorless cameras. Nice, right, after all, you already had these batteries. But they were just weak.. my Olympus Pen F and OM-Ds have a larger battery, for an m43 system that's rarely used for video. They're fine in the APS-C models, and kind of fantastic in my Sony RX10 Mark IV, but not really equal to the task of a pro/enthusiast mirrorless. Sony fixed this on the A9 with a larger battery, and to an extent on the A7 Mark III by getting medeval on battery consumption.  Nikon and Canon both adopted their respective pro-DSLR batteries for their mirrorless. Nikon's is the much higher capacity EN-EL15b, about 1900mAh, but they still manage to squeak out only about 310 shots (CIPA). The seem to basically be back the A7 point \\u2014 they have not tweaked their image processors or other components for the rigors of mirrorless life. There may be power savings options on the Nikon. I know my OM-D E-M5 Mark II is rated for 310 shots on a battery, but with the right settings and a little luck, I can get 500\\u2013750. A typical DSLR gets roughly 1000 shots on one battery, and they're pretty consistent if you're shooting stills using the viewfinder.  As with Canon, Nikon put only one card slot in both of the Z's, and it's XQD, not SD. The XQD card is PCI Express based, and will ultimately be replaced by the CFexpress card, but it's compatible with CFexpress, says Nikon. Canon went to that other fast new card, the CFast card based on SATA, on some of their models, but not the EOS R. It remains to be seen if Nikon's using the speed here for anything or not\\u2026 plenty of SD card based cameras only support UHS-I even though UHS-III is the current spec, so I'm not convinced XQD ever gets used. But it's on other Nikons, so no big problems here, other than the single slot.  While both new lens mounts, the Nikon Z6 has a 16mm flange focal distance, the shortest yet, versus Sony's 18mm and Canon's 20mm. That may allow more conpact wide-angle designs, but we have not really seen that in their three lens offerings yet. They also joing Canon in a very wide lens throat, at 55mm, versus 54mm for Canon and 46.5mm for Sony. This will allow Canon and Nikon to offer very fast lenses I can't ever afford, such as Nikon's announced-for-next-year 58mm f/0.95, at around $6500. I'll stick with my 25mm f/0.95 for Olympus from Mitagon (China), which you can get for under $350.  Nikon offers more still image formats than just about anyone, including a zillion variations of raw, JPEG, and even TIFF. Honestly, if I'm bothering to use a full frame, I'm shooting in 14-bit uncompressed raw. But thanks for asking. Hey, it's only 24 megapixels, after all! You mean you don't have a 24TB RAID at home?  For burst shooting, the Z6 does 12fps with focus lock, 9fps with continuous autofocus. That seems more like a 2018 mirrorless camera to me than Canon's. Sure, not everyone does fast shooting, and I thought I didn't need it when I had my Canon 6D and it's tiny buffer. But when I got my Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark II, that changed. That was 2015, and I had 10fps burst shooting without AF, which slowed to about 5fps when the buffer fills if using a UHS-II card, or 5fps with AF, both of which ran unbuffered to SD. That's 5fps continous for 64GB, dude! And they seem to have only about a 20 shot buffer. Maybe counting on XQD speed, I don't know, but on paper, it sounds limited.  As with Canon, Nikon went to town on super hirest viewfinder and back panel. I found 2.5 million dots or so to be the crossover between I love mirrorless and I'm bothered by mirrorless, so maybe the extra million or so dots will convince the remaining holdouts. And like Canon, it's pretty hires on the back of the camera. Though unfortunately, Nikon is under the thrall of evil here, including only a tilt screen, not full articulation. I don't like that, but for me it's not a dealbreaker. I did buy that RX10 after all.  The Z6, Z7, and Z lenses are weatherproof, basically same as the D850. That is a great feature for some, a complete win for other folks. I don't need every camera weatherproof, but I would not buy into a new system that didn't offer at least some weatherproof options. I'm shooting outside all the time, in any weather.  Nikon's got a more standard 273 or so AF points, so it's pretty ordinary on-chip hybrid PDAF/CDAF. I suspect Canon may have the edge here over Nikon or Sony, but I have not heard of any specific problems with Nikon's AF. So it's probably just dandy, but nothing special.  Controls wise, Nikon managed to get a mode dial on the left (rejoice people!) and still a couple of twisty dials on the top right, and a tiny display. I think they stuck to the Nikon gestalt far more than Canon did, so no innovations, but also, no freaked out Nikon users. Do your own math here! Nikon already had a bit of programmablility in their interfaces, if not Olympus-level, and they seem to have stuck with that here, too. Though I do rather like the extra ring on the Canon, it's not like any of us have had a problem doing without.  Still Shooting: Sony A7 Mark III  Well, I wanted to like the Sony A7 Mark III, since I've been enjoying my RX10 Mark II, for those times when the full m43 rig is too much trouble. But I guess I've been a little spoiled \\u2014 as good as it's reputation, the A7 Mark III doesn't seem all that sophisticated compared to the RX10. I guess it got more of its DNA from the A9 than the A7 series, oddly enough.  For one, I expected a stacked sensor. The A7 Mark III had a BSI sensor, but no stacking. What's the difference. Well, technically, it could be a straight up BSI sensor or a 2-layer stacked sensor, there's no effective difference. But the A9 and the RX10M4 have 3-layer stacked sensors. The extra layer is memory. So the RX10M4 is kind of miserable when it needs to write to SD \\u2014 it's only using UHS-I, and it stops shooting to write when the buffer is full. But the buffer is on-chip! So it can shoot in raw at 24fps and buffer 180 shots on-chip. No, I don't need 24fps or 180 shots, but it's faster than my Olympus, and the practical difference between 180 and no limits is pretty small.  So here we have a 9.9fps shooting rate and a 33 shot raw buffer. Not a dealbreaker, but also not what I expected. It's faster than Canon, slower than Nikon. Not a standout.  Sony's got SD, like Canon, but they've got dual slots. The single slot isn't a dealbreaker for me, but it is for many pros. I think the A7III is the first Sony to acutally support UHS-II interface rates, and that's only on Slot 1, but either way, two slots. Olympus did much the same on the OM-D E-M1 Mark II. I do like the idea of matched slots \\u2014 Canon's habit of two different card types on their pro models is pretty annoying. If they kept up, they'd find that the faster SD cards as fast as CF or CFast.  Sony's had sketchy battery life for most of the A7 series, but they seem to have addressed that in the A7III, even without changing out the battery as they did on the A9. That's more likely battery life than either the Canon or the Nikon. So a real win here.  Sony's got a good AF system, and perhaps the best Eye AF on the market. The A7MIII doesn't have the coverage of the EOS R, but it's perfectly adequate. And consider what isn't always talked about: pretty much every PDAF mirrorless has more AF sensor coverage than a DSLR. As well, since the PDAF sensors are integrated into the sensor, there's no possibility of being out of calibration. DSLRs need calibration with the off-sensor PDAF sensors for the best focus. As well, CDAF can be more accurate in many situations, it's just slow. All mirrorless with PDAF sensors use both methods and achive both fast and accurate focus.  And it's true of all still shooting on mirrorless, that Your Mileage May Vary. Bigly. I have the same battery in my RX10, which is rated for 400 shots. I have done over 2500 shots on a battery in some conditions. Still, if you're serious about any mirrorless, you learn all the power saving settings. You buy extra batteries. And maybe a battery grip!  Then there are the menus. Ok, Sony's not as mentally deranged as Olympus on menus (aside from Oly's excellent quick menu), but they have definitely not consulted the saner people in the company on their menu layouts. That's been an issue for some time. Go drinking with some experienced Sony shooters and they'll eventually start showing the scars obtainined trying to grok Sony's thinking here. I'd take Canon or Nikon over this, but it's not a dealbreaker.  Still Shooting: Winner?  I'd be torn between Nikon and Sony based on the specs %3Crim shot%3E. In neither is a pure winner. The Z6 is going to be bad on battery, the Sony is stuck with less potential in lens offerings. I'd honestly have to go out and try each one for a week to decide between them. Only Canon threw me a few dealbreakers. And it depends on why you want mirrorless anyway. Because it's trendy? Wait until you're mature enough to have a better reason.  I started out in mirrorless to just get a better pocket camera. I eventually started building the system to have a smaller camera pack. My 25lbs Canon system shot great photos, but 25lbs? After a day at the Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania, climbing over 1000ft vertically with that bag, I vowed to get a few more Olympus components and try just using that for awhile. Two years, a body, and several lenses later, I hadn't picked up the 6D.  The problem with mirrorless full frame is that, while the body shrinks, it's not necessarily all that much lighter, especially factoring in 3x as many batteries. Then you have the glass. Not necessarily any lighter. In fact, the same telephoto design will deliver a longer, ever-so-slightly heavier lens to your mirrorless full frame.  There certainly are other reasons to like mirrorless. You have all kinds of available information in the viewfinder. You don't just shoot through the lens, you shoot through the film. You have a far, far better time with manual lenses: manual focus is better on a good mirrorless display than a DSLR viewfinder, you have focus peaking, your EVF adjusts to give you full brightness with any lens at any f-stop, etc. You can use your viewfinder for video, and you'll have a video-worth AF system.  So it's worth thinking if full frame is really worth it. Canon and Nikon certainly seem to think so, but they would.  Video Shooting: Canon  I was kind of hoping this would finally be the non-CinemaEOS camera that Canon could finally make without crippling their 4K video. Nope. Despite the EOS R being pointed squarely at Sony, they just couldn't deliver the thing that sells more Sony A7s than anything else: full frame 4K video. Canon is cropping their image by a 1.7x crop factor. Honestly, if I didn't want full frame, I'd get the otherwise-best stills-for-video camera on the market, the Panasonic GH5, and save myself some money on the way. So really, as with stills and also considering that IBIS is even more necessary for video, I could just stop here with Canon.  It's a shame, too, because they actually did fix a few things. They support IPB AVC recording up to 120Mb/s, which ain't bad, and AVC-Intra, not that ridiculous old MJPEG, up to 480Mb/s. And yes, you can write to a UHS-II SD card at 480Mb/s. They go up to about 300MB/s, depending on the flash memory used.  Canon's dual pixel AF was made for video, so I have no worries about excellent autofocus here, when you need it. It's well proven.  The other thing Canon did right here is to offer 10-bit 4:2:2 video, and they do Log recording in and out of camera. But 8-bit Log is often the wrong answer, so in-camera, it's a crapshoot. But only via an external recorder via HDMI for 10-bit, so that's another $800 for an Atomos if you actually want to use it. Why? No idea. Since Sony's not offering 10-bit video at all, you'd think internal 10-bit would be a competitive advantage, particularly given Canon's history in video, high bitrates, etc.  The EOS R is also limited on video resolutions. It does 2160p30 maximum in 4K, and UltraHD only, no DCI 4K. Gotta protect those more expensive cameras, again, I see. And in HD, it's 1080p60 maximum. This is not serious video support for a 2018 camera. And Canon is supposed to be the go-to for this stuff. Or, well, they were ten years ago. Maybe it's not just the DSLR vs. mirrorless thing causing their drop in market share?  Again, I don't see any reason to use an EOS R over a GH5.  Video Shooting: Nikon  Nikon does full frame video in 4K, Hurray! They actually did this on the D5, too, so maybe no shock. But sadly, this is only 8-bit in-camera, and only at 100Mb/s IPB AVC as well, so it's strictly consumer quality. I know, it's not a pro camera. But this is Nikon \\u2014 what are they protecting, Canon, Sony, and Panasonic cinema cameras? They should have gone all medeval on those folks buttocks with super high bitrate options, particularly since they force that stupid XQD card on everyone (Video-Dave likes XQD cards less than Stills-Dave does, not sure why).  Like Canon, Nikon also supports 10-bit 4:2:2 recording, which again, Sony does not. So that's at least an improvement over Sony and Panasonic if full-frame recording is what you're after. Though its even more mysterious that Nikon didn't support any faster recording, given their beefier memory cards. WTF, Nikon? In camera, it's 8-bit with optional Log recording.  And also, why the video resolutions? Nikon supports only up to 1080p120 or 2160p30. And they only support UHD in 4K, not DCI. Again, Nikon, what's the deal here? Even Olympus supports DCI 4K in the OM-D E-M1 mark II, and they're not even known for video.  So yeah, you get full frame 4K UltraHD here, roughly Sony level in-camera and better with an external recorder. I guess it's an option, but not terribly exciting, because there's really nothing new or even exactly current here.  Video Shooting: Sony  Sony's A7 series has become the go-to for full frame video shooting. I suppose that's inevitable, given that mirrorless is just superior to DSLR for video, and Sony was the only game in town.  But the A7 Mark III is strictly consumer grade, other than the full frame sensor. It does 2160p30 maximum, UltraHD not DCI-4K, and 1080p120 maximum. It's got built-in Log, and can record to an external recorder, but no matter what you do, it's 8-bit. The internal recording is 100Mb/s max.  And sure, like Canon and Nikon, Sony's got good mirrorless AF, so it's good in video, too, as unlike with most DLRs, the on-sensor AF is the primary AF system, after all.  Video Shooting: Winner  The winner, in my mind is %3Cdrum roll%3E the Panasonic GH5! Ok, sure, it wasn't even racing today. So it must be good, eh? And the rumor mill has Panasonic releasing a full frame camera next week at Photokina, which right now seems to be a really stupid idea for Panasonic. And yet, given the no one gets serious nature of full frame video, maybe they have a niche. I'd rather seem them release a Micro Four Thirds body with Super 35mm sensor. JVC already does this in their camcorders, thus, it's possible.  I'll drop in one Canon win here. If you're already a Canon video shooter, the EOS R actually doesn't make your crop worse than many of Canon's cameras. And it adds one advantage to EF shooters \\u2014 the filter adapter. The priciest of the three adapters allows you to put a filter between your EF lens and your EOS R. Video folks always want ND filters, and this gives you one filter for every lens. If you're ok with extreme cropping and no IBIS, as existing Canon 4K shooters are, this is a pretty cool advantage.  If I had to pick amongst the crowd present, I'd pick Sony, because they actually have a complete system. If we ignored that, I'd pick Nikon at least until I find a dealbreaker, because of the slightly superior video options, and the promise of the new lens mount.  Overall Winner  In actual practice, I would not personally choose one camera just for video and one just for stills if I were moving to a new system. I have been doing stills mostly, a little video actually on my RX10 Mark IV in 4K, and that's all I need at the moment. I also have Panasonic pro camcorders, the old 3-chip sort, for more demanding video work in better light. If I got serious about video again, I'd get a GH5\\u2026 or maybe a Blackmagic.  But from this comparison, for full frame, I'd have to choose just one. I'm leaning toward the Nikon Z6, and if anyone's handing them out, the Z7 would be an even better option. As would the A7RIII. But it's a small preference, and I'd certainly have to spend some time with each camera.  In all creative activities, it's important to find tools that fit your brain. I used Canon for two decades and found them ok. But the Olympus OM-D and Pen F just fit my brain better\\u2026 that's not something I can fully qualify or quantify. You'll find a different match. But it's worthwhile to try a bunch of different options before you jump into a totally new system.  It's like a marriage. First, you should really date. It's cheap to get into a marriage, particularly when drunk and in Vegas, but that's the wrong way. Reading specs, getting excited, and ordering online without actually living with the camera, same thing. And much like a marriage, while it's cheap to get into, ten years later, with all the kids, the house, the lenses, etc. it's expensive to leave.

MTF numbers have to be consistently high, not on one lens, but every lens. I can't begin to explain why feature sets have to be universal in a lens line. The same goes for non manufacturers products. I remember selling a line of lenses for Leica M series camera bodies. What killed me was the lack of precision between offerings. It turned out that procedures used by two old world lens makers was in conflict. Just enough that serious users saw them.

I have no knowledge whatsoever about any of the Nikon or Sony products and so to repeat any of the opinions of others would not be worthwhile.

I have an Olympus OM-D mirrorless Camera as well as a Canon 6-D and they both serve me well but as far as which one is best then I do not have a clue. I am sure that I will never use more than about 20% of the features and things that the Olympus is capable of although I have noticed that it has a preference for expensive glass if one expects it to perform well as the original lens that was supplied with the camera body was disappointing.  I also have a fondness for the Canon brand and progressed from an early model Rebel to a 70-D because it had more features and yet I never really needed so many them and never used them except to see what they do and then basically forget about them. At the time I thought that being able to dial in the white balance in Degrees Kelvin would be ever so cool. As would being able to take multiple exposures and things like that but they never happened and white balance is set in post anyway.

You can make your research and if you find the platform deem fit then you can go ahead just like i did.  When it was first launched, the price of the EOS cryptocurrency sat at $2.29. However, it then doubled in less than 24 hours, with EOS hitting $5.40.  This hike did not last, however, and the coin soon started falling, breaking one support level after another. EOS found its bottom at $0.59, which is where it remained until late October 2017. Once the crypto bull run that marked the year reached its peak, EOS joined the rally, and it skyrocketed to $16.39 on January 13, 2018.  However, while most coins peaked around this date or earlier, EOS' all-time high came later, in April 2018. In mid-April, the crypto market \\u2013 which had been crashing since January \\u2013 started seeing a new bullish wave. Prices started going up, and many assumed that the so-called 'crypto winter' was over.  These days, we know that the surge in April was only the eye of the storm, as the crash continued as May 2018 arrived. But, for those few weeks, the EOS price jumped once more, breaking its former record, and going up to $22.89. This was the coin's highest price, and it has never reached these highs again, at least so far.  Following this second surge, EOS kept dropping, briefly stopped by support here and there, but eventually, it dropped to its new bottom at $1.86 around December 7, 2018. In 2019, the coin saw gradual growth, although it progressed slowly, and everything it had achieved by mid-2019 was undone in the second half of the year, as it slowly returned to the level where it sat ever since \\u2013 between $2 and $2.8.  The EOS price has fluctuated in this range, except for on three occasions in 2020. The first one was between mid-January and mid-February, when it joined another bull run that took it to $5.35. The second was in August 2020, when it hit $3.7, and the last one is right now, led by Bitcoin (BTC), which is once again approaching its all-time highs at $20,000.  EOS, on the other hand, is as far away from its own record as it can be, hovering around $3.26.  What is happening to EOS these days?  Unfortunately, EOS has not been making headlines in 2020, as the crypto industry is mostly focused on the decentralised finance (DeFi) sector. When DeFi started slowing down, bull runs took over, and most of the attention went to Bitcoin.  However, that does not mean that EOS has been doing nothing. Its developers at Block.one recently announced the EOS Resource Model proposal, and the soon-to-arrive review of various talented organisations that responded to the company's invitation to evaluate their code.  Block.one also recently expressed its pleasure with how Spielworks built a rewards and loyalty platform for gamers using EOSIO.  The company also worked on adding new features to its Training and Certification segment of the blockchain.  And, of course, as a development platform, EOS has also been making moves to attract people to develop new DeFi projects on its network. The network already has quite a few successful projects, although the majority of the developers are still focusing on developing DeFi on Ethereum.  EOS price prediction 2021: what to expect from EOS going forward?  Lastly, we arrive at the most interesting part \\u2014 EOS coin price prediction for 2021 and beyond.  According to TradingBeasts, the EOS price in December 2020 will reach a maximum of $3.4, after which the forecasting service expects it to drop back down to $2.7, on average.  In January 2021, its EOS crypto price prediction shows the coin remaining near this level, at around $2.7, later expecting it to experience a slow but steady rise throughout the year, with the coin having the potential to hit a high of $3.9 next December. The average price of EOS is predicted to reach $4.07 in December 2022, and then $5.03 in December 2023.  Wallet Investor also expects the currency's price to rise in early 2021, although their EOS coin forecast says that the asset will see a price crash in the second half of the year. The event will potentially lead EOS down to $1.2 one year from now.  As for CryptoGround, they have a very bullish EOS prediction. In fact, their EOS forecast claims that the coin will simply keep climbing, with its value reaching $4.17 in six months, $4.7 in one year, and $21.4 by December 2025."}, {"upvote": 17, "content": "EOS has the following unique benefits.  \\u25cf High transaction throughput: EOS enables the execution of millions of transactions per second, which means that it has high transaction throughput.  \\u25cf Free transactions for end-users: EOS provides the users to mine and execute a large number of transactions without any additional fees.  \\u25cf Governance based on user votes: Each transaction executed in EOS is bound to follow the rules laid down in the constitution.

It is a blockchain protocol that allows people from all over the world to send and receive funds without needing a third party.  However, unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum can do so much more than perform financial transactions. It became the first ever blockchain project to host something called smart contract technology. A smart contract is a piece of code that allows people to enter into an agreement without the need for an intermediary.  Once certain conditions happen, the smart contract is able to automatically move funds from one person to another. Just like smart contracts, every single transaction that ever occurs in the Ethereum system is available to view on the public blockchain, making the network transparent.  In terms of performance, Ethereum is able to confirm a movement of funds in about 16 seconds. The blockchain is able to scale a maximum of 15 transactions each second, which is much less than other smart contract protocols, however, I will discuss later what they are planning to do to increase this.  So, now that you know what Ethereum actually is, in the next part of my Ethereum price prediction 2020 guide, I am going to discuss the importance of taking price prediction guides with caution.  Ethereum Price Prediction 2020  The first prediction I wanted to talk to you about was released by an online analyst called Bobby Ullery. The model that Ullery uses is based on the global economy and the assumption that blockchain technology will play a much bigger role in international trade.  According to the analyst, Bitcoin and Ethereum will each hold 25% of the entire cryptocurrency industry, which he predicts will have a total market capitalization of $4.5 trillion in 2020.  Market capitalization is used to calculate the total value of a cryptocurrency, much in the same way as real-world companies are valued. It is achieved by multiplying the current market price of a coin by the total amount of coins in circulation. For example, if the value of the coin was worth $20 and there were 10 million coins in circulation, then the total market capitalization would be $200 million.  Now, in the case of Ethereum, although there is no fixed supply, Ullery uses a total coin circulation of 100 million as this is what Vitalik Buterin has suggested will happen.  So, considering all of the above, this particular Ethereum price prediction 2020 believes that Ethereum will be worth $11,375. This would give Ethereum a total market capitalization of over $1 trillion! So, is this possible?  Many investors do not know there are platforms that can make the investment of ethereum and other cryptocurrency grow.Investing your crypto in a platform like cryptomax(www.cryptomax.tech)where by your invested coin will be doubled after 7 days.Try it.  For Ullery's Ethereum price prediction 2020 to come true, it would need to increase its all-time high of just over $1300, by 775%. This actually isn't an unrealistic prediction when you consider that Ethereum increased its price by 10,000% in 2017! But what do you think?"}, {"upvote": 320, "content": "Very interesting question. There are a few possibilities to your question.  They range from:  1. Next to nothing 2. 100,000 USD or even more. There are also lots of possibilities in between.  Was that the answer you were looking for? Of course not. You want as exact an answer as one could possibly provide, down to the penny.  The thing is that that was the answer you needed.  So many things can happen with Ethereum over the course of 2018. Below, allow me to explain what could potentially make Ethereum crumble and what could make Ethereum skyrocket.  Disaster scenarios:  1. China, South Korea and other Asian countries ban cryptocurrency trading and mining. We've already seen cryptos across the board plummet by -20% within the hour just because of *speculation* that Asian governments might ban trading and mining. Just imagine if they actually see that threat through. 2. Another major exchange gets hacked. Could you imagine if Coinbase got hacked? You'd see the price of all cryptos deflate like a popped balloon within seconds. With the proliferation of cryptos and resulting exchanges, we should expect more exchanges to get hacked in 2018. Depending on the size of the hacked exchanges, you may see prices either barely move or you may see the Earth split in two. 3. Buterin and Ethereum developers get hacked and/or fail to deliver on their lofty promises. If there were to be a successful attack on the very Ethereum core team you could see Ether (and Ether alone) plunge dramatically. Payday scenarios:  1. Buterin & Co. implement Casper/Proof of Stake. This is a first to the finish line race out of the major cryptos and Ethereum is easily leading the way. Whenever (not if ever) Ethereum implements PoS, hold on tight because it's going to be wild. If Bitcoin doesn't switch to PoS at the same time you could easily see Ether overtake Bitcoin on the coin value to USD pair within a short span of time. 2. Corporations and/or major developers start utilizing Ethereum for everyday processes or decentralized apps are released to the public. Both of these would drive demand for Ether up dramatically as more and more potential holders seek to buy and either up their stake in Ether or enter for the first time. 3. Bitcoin continues to not really do anything useful. It's interesting how Bitcoin has primarily become little more than a store of value rather than an actual currency. With the current technical headwinds that Bitcoin is facing, we shouldn't expect this to change any time soon. I mean there are very good reasons why major corporations are flocking to Ethereum and not to Bitcoin. I suspect that we will continue to see that trend continue here in 2018, if not speed up even more. Those are the biggest factors that I can think of. Of course all of this is not to be taken as any kind of investment advice as I am no financial adviser. I am merely someone who is very excited about the potential of cryptocurrency from both a real-world application standpoint and from a personal investment standpoint. We all invest at our own risk and should all be doing thorough market research to determine which opportunities may be right for each person."}, {"upvote": 12, "content": "There is no doubt that for now, Bitcoin remains ahead of Ethereum, but with its recent drop in value, many have started questioning its supremacy. Could this be the time for Ethereum to overtake Bitcoin?  Ethereum has the potential to be bigger than Bitcoin and become the dominant crypto asset, according to a renowned market analyst. While the price of Ethereum's native coin \\u2013 ETH \\u2013 is still some considerable distance off the stern of the flagship BTC, the gap is slowly closing and Ether's hold is overflowing with the kind of stores Bitcoin simply did not have at the same point on the map.  The fortunes of both Bitcoin and Ethereum have often run parallel as they reflect similar patterns of ebb and flow along the horizontal graphs that illuminate the puzzled faces of many traders across the globe\\u2026Traders do not only buy and hold bitcoins and Ethereum for potential gains but also invest on platforms like Coinpaq(www.coinpaq.tech), a service companies , where investors are able to leverage substantial returns on their investments without having to worry about price swings or volatility in the crypto market. If you look at where the market cap of Bitcoin was six years ago it was approximately $5 billion, whereas Ethereum at a similar point in terms of its life cycle (six years since launching) has a market cap of $300billion. With the widespread usage of Ethereum's network following its latest upgrade, the cryptoasset continues to offer a lot of opportunities to developers and investors.  Ethereum could certainly challenge Bitcoin for the number one spot among cryptoassets in terms of market cap, but it will be a few years yet before this could potentially happen. We must remember both tokens were created for different reasons. Bitcoin is a decentralised currency and Ethereum is a platform to build decentralised apps that make use of smart contracts.  Lately, however, ETH has been planting its boots firmly on its own path. Over the last few weeks \\u2013 arguably driven by BTC's price surges \\u2013 Ethereum has been quietly veering off the course of following the leader's footsteps and, instead, building towards considerable growth within its own network.

It all comes down to being permissioned and non-trustless. That leads to the following, insurmountable problems.  1. 1 person is in charge and can change the constitution at will. This wouldn't be so bad in a trustless and permissionless platform, but wreaks havoc in a non trustless and permissioned platform. Also if it were several people in charge that have to write a constitution, it's even worse, because writing a constitution with many people is always victim of special interests, lobbying and the like. 2. A design that doesn't prevent cartel formation. Cartels always happen if it is possible. 3. If the security of a network relies on 1 person, it can't get mass adoption, because that person has to be perfect. Unfortunately, he isn't perfect, because he has made a very bad constitution.

If I'm being honest, this gotta be the shittest claim I've heard tbh. The ATLA verse isn't based on narrative scalings unless they are pure statements of someone being the pinnacle of something, like the avatar being the strongest or Toph being narrative seen to be the strongest earthbender.

So this basically means that this feat that Bumi performed was %3E to Lin, Suyin, Bolin, and other metal benders cutting down a building via earthbending.  And if you're wondering why this is relevant, is due to Suyin being able to stalemate Kuvira for a while (this was prime Kuvira, she didn't get stronger at all after this matchup, and remained the same in the final fight against Korra. Korra never used AS in the final fight, as it would have been an astronomical stomp.)   %3E Conclusion So by feats & what we've seen and what's been stated throughout the series, Bumi should take the W and narrative arguments can't be used in Kuvira's scaling as she isn't an Avatar/spirit or has been stated to be capable of doing something incapable of any previous bender (besides using a mecha).

First of all he has Sage mode which means he can react to any attack she throws  The same Sage mode which helped Madara dodge Sasuke like childs play who should be way way faster than Sakura.  Also the same Sage mode that dodged Flying Raijin which beats speed.  So none of Sakura's attacks will touch him which is just punches.  Then comes Hashirama wood style which is Sakura's Kryptonite.  Something brimming with lifeforce makes his wood style stronger.  Byakugou is medical ninjutsu which is concerned with life force since regeneration is part of it  So the more she tries resisting, the more stronger it will make Hashirama's wood.  Then he has Gate of the Great God which was able to stop the ten tails.  If people think Sakura has more chakra than the ten tails and is stronger so I don't know what to think.  So Sakura can't do shit against it.  I won't even take the name of wood golem and 1000 hands. The difference between a Human(Hashirama) and an Ant(Sakura) is what it is.

You will end up with buying alot gear than just limit it to 35k. I bought my nikon d3200 for 24k after alot of saving. It's basically an electronic potato. Not a lot of features. But you don't need them tbh. If you want to shoot landscapes, portraits, food, products. You'll need to rely on lenses rather than camera features. Don't believe me? Have a look.. These landscapes were shot on a kit lens and d3200 by me.  My advice is don't get too lost in the features. They are all marketing baits. For example a Nikon d3200 or nikon 5300 or any camera in that range has 24 mp sensor. While a Canon 5d mark iii has a 20.2 mp sensor. In no way is are those two nikon close to canons 5d mark iii not even In price range and performance. All the mp facts, wifi features will barely help. The person behind the camera matters. I didn't geo those shots ^ on day one. I shot for a long time studied the theory of mastering all aspects of the camera. I still ain't perfect. But I have come a long way from barely being able to set the exposure right. Learn how to manage different settings of the camera. The most basic dslr will do. Lenses do matter all. Buy a 50mm it is a must whether it's nikon or canon . Once you use it you fall in love with it. But if you have an initial budget go for something like a Canon 600d or a 700d or a Nikon d5300 or nikon d3300. Because I know the pain of using a low end dslr. It's bad for low light and other stuff due to low iso capabilities. But if you have the determination to learn then the most basic dslr are well capable. Here are some samples images from my camera. If you would like to view more check out @the_nikonian on instagram that's my profile.  You are the biggest feature you have, a feature that no company no brand can give. A feature that can improve forever and ever. Even the world's best started from scratch and their cameras did only a small part of the work. It was their knowledge that made the difference. Learn photography theoretically and practice it alot more on the field. Keep the hunger for learning more. I'm not a pro. But I have learnt alot. I'm self taught trial and error and alot of online reading and YouTube videos. This will help more than anything else. If you have a maximum budget of 35k go for a basic dslr like a Nikon D3300 or canon 1300d it is fine. But if you can extend your budget a bit more. Go for a Canon 600d or nikon d5300 even a used one is good condition will do. Buy the right lenses that suit your needs. Pick a genre of photography that you like. For example : portraits or landscapes or something else. Search and study about it and buy your gear accordingly. The first two images were shot with a kit lens and the 3rd and 4th with a 50mm f/1.8 g and last image with 55-200mm lens. All shot with a Nikon d3200. Hope this helps.

But I would also look into mirrorless. Specifically on Fuji x-t20 - excellent small camera with all manual controls you will even need. Why? Its from my personal experience. I shot with canons, Nikons, crop frames, full frames, and now shoot with Fuji (x-t1). What I love about Fuji is that pictures look great right out of camera, and need no or very minimal editing. Also, with mirrorless, the picture that you see on your screen (or viewfinder) is the final picture you will see after you press the shutter (a great bonus). Why x-t20? simple - x-t2 is Fuji current top of the line camera (other than GFX of course), and x-t20 is a smaller brother, that inherited all the main features of x-t2, but in a smaller body, and cheaper price tag."}, {"upvote": 2, "content": "Nikon B700 is a fixed lens compact camera while Canon 1300D is an interchangeable lens DSLR. They have their own advantages. Please read about DSLR vs compact cameras."}, {"upvote": 16, "content": "It's a decent start, but it also tells you a few things about Canon's thinking right now. And I think they made some good decisions, and a few bad ones that may have not been choices as much as technical limitations.  Neither Canon nor Nikon were actually new to mirrorless with last August's introductions. But the R and the Z are professional formats, even if the first models are not a match for the top-of-the-line DSLRs yet. Both Canon and Nikon took on the idea that mirrorless was something less than DSLR, a step between DSLR and compact digital cameras (aka point and shoot). Nikon's 1 system used the same 1\\u2033 sensor size found in high-end P&S cameras like the Sony RX10 and RX100. But Canon put out a very compact APS-C system with their EOS M. And a funny thing happened: while Nikon's 1 system is now defunct, the EOS M is very popular, albeit not necessarily in the USA. Canon's been the #2 mirrorless brand in Japan in 2016 and 2017 (BCN rankings, second to Olympus) and looks to be taking the #1 spot for the 2018 year\\u2026 without even counting the EOS R. Canon seems to have nailed the consumer mirrorless ILC with the EOS M.  So it should be no surprise that Canon got into mirrorless on a higher level with the EOS R, but then again, it should be. Canon is slower to react to competition than just about anyone. Why this, why now? Canon feels the competition.  For most of history since maybe the 1940s or 1950s, Canon and Nikon had much of the professional market for cameras. In the 1960s, led by Nikon, they won an 80% share, and it's been pretty much 80\\u201390% ever since. Canon managed to flip the market share on Nikon by being the first to court consumers, and then by delivering the fastest speeds for pro sports shooters. But for a long time, the only 35mm, then full-frame choice for most pros was Nikon or Canon.  This last year, the whole industry sold only 11.6 million ILCs, less than half of those sold in 2013. And 2017 was actually an 8% increase from 2016. But more the point, DSLRs sold only accounted for 65% of the ILC market\\u2026 clearly, Nikon and Canon were no longer winning an 80\\u201390% share. And while Canon's mirrorless sales were up 70% in 2017, Nikon wasn't even part of that. And of course, neither was competitive with Sony, Olympus, Panasonic, or Fujifilm in higher-end mirrorless. No one knows just where the DSLR vs. mirrorless ratio settles out in the long term, but it's not going to be terribly favorable to any company only making DSLRs.  What's It For?  If you look carefully at the EOS R, like the Nikon Z's, you'll know just what it's for: the EOS R is a mirrorless body for Canon users to buy, so that they don't buy Sonys. This is the big factor. Canon users have been trying Sony A7s with adapters, and liking them. Some keep it as an accessory, but some sell their Canon gear and move to Sony. Canon needs that to stop, and their first reaction to this situation is the EOS R.  Canon's introducing one body and four lenses, two of them quite expensive, but still, that's not a full system for nearly anyone who needs a system camera. It's a start. But if you're already a Canon shooter, the R is with an adapter is going to let you try out mirrorless with all of your glass \\u2014 even EF-S lenses, but EF-M lenses are impossible \\u2014 your existing batteries and flash units, etc. It's a much simpler way to experiment with mirrorless for today's Canon shooter. If you're new to ILCs and want full-frame mirrorless, EOS R won't be a great option for at least 3\\u20135 years, depending on how quickly Canon rolls out new glass.  So you're supposed to compare the EOS R to a Sony A7 Mark III, but the closest match is actually the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV. So you're getting more or less a mirrorless 5D Mark IV with some improvements/extra features for $900 less. That's a pretty fine deal, speaking from the Canon universe. It's a bit more expensive than the A7 Mark III, but no one's more aggressive on body pricing than Sony.  I think it succeeds in its mission. If I still had my Canon system and was ready for full frame mirrorless, the EOS R is a no-brainer versus the Sony. It's not even the cost of the bodies or the minute details of the features, but the fact it's already part of my system. The cheap lens adapter is only $100, and it works perfectly. For a bit more, I could get the adapter with filter holder, simply brilliant for video work.  Video Issues  Alas, on that latter one, Canon's still being Canon, and not in a good way. They're still crippling 4K video on the EOS R, delivering the same 1.7x crop you have on the EOS 5D mark IV. If you're buying a full-frame DSLR for video, the point is to have full frame video. With that crop, you're better off going to a Panasonic GH5 or a Blackmagic Design Pocket Cinema Camera 4K, depending on your needs.  I expect for most stills work, you have a 5D Mark IV as far as the quality goes. You won't quite match Sony in very low light, but you'll have a bit more resolution in bright light, so it's probably not a big deal for most photographers. You'll have the Canon color, which Sony has yet to match, and the Canon menus you're used to\\u2026 well, maybe. They have a few new controls on the camera, which changes around the way its used. There's a programmable ring control on lenses, but you won't run into that with adapted EF lenses unless you get the third adapter, the one with the ring control. There's also a touch strip on the back, which most reviewers aren't yet crazy about.  Neither Sony nor Canon has 10-bit in-camera video, which is what you need for serious Log shooting. But the EOS R does have that as an external option, at least. I'd bet on Sony's A7S Mark III offering 10-bit in some fashion, but like Canon, Sony's got their own cinema camera business they feel compelled to protect by crippling the mirrorless models. Oddly, though, Nikon opted for the same thing, in-camera 8-bit, external 10-bit, even without a video market to protect. I guess that leaves them both with a feature to add to a higher end model, next year. Or save money and buy the GH5 right now.  Conclusions  So basically, I think the EOS R is attractive to anyone with a full Canon system thinking about mirrorless. If Canon's annoying behaviors haven't driven you away yet, this may well be your mirrorless. I don't really find any huge problems with it. Knowing that Sony was the initial target, nothing about the EOS R or the Nikon Zs were particularly unexpected. Both aim for the Sony's, Nikon at both the A7III and the A7RIII, Canon's basically doing the A7III competitor now. I would hope they're holding off an A7RIII competitor until they have some improved sensor tech, probably also going into the EOS 5DS Mark II."}, {"upvote": 21, "content": "The EOS 1D X is pretty much overkill\\u2026 this is kind of an odd list, with over a 12:1 price range. Not only is the 1D X around $6,000 (body-only), but you're going to need expensive CFast cards for 4K video, and the 4K video on the thing is in gigantic Motion JPEG files, and not all that amazing anyway. If I wanted a 4K camera for video, I'd recommend either get a Panasonic GH4 or perhaps a Sony A7s mark II.  The Nikon D80 (2006) and the D3 (2007) are ancient models and don't shoot video. The D3s does shoot video, but only 720p, not full HD.  The EOS 7D (2009) is also fairly old. It can shoot 720p or 1080p video, but only 12 minutes at a time. The others here can shoot 29\\u203259\\u2033 without stopping \\u2014 that's a limit set to avoid paying a European camcorder tax. While it doesn't apply at all in the USA, most camera manufacturers (other than Panasonic, far as I know) impose this limit even on North American and Japanese models.  The Nikon D5300 isn't a bad choice for video. It's a few models old, it came out in 2003, the current model is the D5600, so it's may be available for a value price. But this line is a consumer line, APS-C sensor, and not terribly expensive. It can shoot video at 1080p up to 60fps\\u2026 not something you'd need for vlogging, but you want 60p for sports or other action video. Another advantage for vlogging, the D5300 has built-in WiFi, so it can be controlled wirelessly via an app. Most Canon and Nikon can be tethered via USB for remote control, and some have add-on controls, but it's handy to have it built-in.  I have the EOS 6D, and it produces amazing video, particularly in low light, where it blows away my far more expensive dedicated camcorders. The 6D right now is a good bargain, but mostly because everyone expects Canon to announce the 6D mark II Real Soon Now. The 6D also has built-in WiFi.  The EOS 5D mark III is the upgrade of Canon's breakthrough EOS 5D mark II. It's a great camera, one of the go-to standards for video-on-stills camera shooting. But while it's a solid choice if you can afford it, it's not the best choice. For one, it's been superceeded by the EOS 5D mark IV, if you're looking for a higher end model that shoots great video.  Of those on your list, the Canon EOS 80D would be my choice for anyone wanting a strong video option. Like the Nikon, it can shoot a variety of modes up to 1080p60. But the real advantage is in the sensor. This is Canon's second-generation mid-range DSLR with what they call a Dual Pixel sensor. This sensor splits each pixel into two separate photodiodes. Based on the way they're masked, each sensor pair works like a phase-detect autofocus sensor. So unlike every other DSLR on your list, the 80D can give you full performance autofocus in video, and things you usually just find on camcorders and mirrorless cameras, like follow-focus in video, etc. Dual Pixel is also used on Canon's 5D mark IV and all the new Cinema EOS video cameras. And the 80D also has built-in WiFi.  Far as the larger idea of a full camera system goes, you can't really go wrong with either Canon or Nikon. They have the two most complete lines of cameras and two most complete collection of lenses. However, neither offers a mirrorless option. So that means you're only shooting video from the back screen, not the viewfinder. And that only the 80D on your list has fully function video autofocus\\u2026 the others will AF in video, but it's on demand, not continuous, and it's often not very good. The phase detect sensors that DSLRs use are not available with the mirror up, which is what you have in video mode.  For one-person vlogging, keep in mind you are going to want to see yourself, which means either an add-on monitor while shooting or an articulated screen. The 80D and the D5300 both have fully articulated screens which let you see what you're recording from the front of the camera. The others do not, and will absolutely require an external monitor for vlogging."}, {"upvote": 5, "content": "It depends on what lenses you are planning to buy.

Choose a camera with a manual setting and experiment with the relationship between lens aperture (f-stop), shutter speed (time) and sensor sensitivity (ISO). Learn the difference between center spot metering and scene metering. Similarly understand the differences between spot focusing and scene focusing. Get a camera with a zoom lens and take photos of faces which fill the entire image both by zooming in on the face and by zooming out then walking forward until the face fills the image. Do you see the difference? Do you understand why there is a difference?  Next, learn the rules of good composition. Understand the rule of thirds, the importance of leading lines, the impact of light and shadow. Be critical of your images. Always ask yourself what would have made this photograph better and try out that idea. Watch photo movies on youtube and read as much as you can about photography.  Every camera has some limitations. Learn to work within those limitations. Start developing a photographic style. Work on seeing possibly great photographs when you walk around or drive anywhere. What do you find yourself photographing most - landscapes? people? buildings? flowers? insects? sports? sunsets? birds? wildlife?  You can do all the above with a relatively inexpensive small-sensor mirrorless camera with a zoom lens. It will be a fairly small camera which is not too much of a problem to carry with you. Take as many images as you can and then study each one. Rinse and repeat until you instinctively know what the image will look like before you even take the shot. Before you even lift the camera you just know that you have to move about twenty feet to your left and to kneel to get the right shot. You just know that the shadow across the front of the church will disappear in half and hour and give you a magnificent image. You just know that the contrast is too high and highlights in the scene will be blown out as white blobs, so you need to under-expose the image a bit. This may take a long time, but remember no pain - no gain.  When you reach this stage in your personal development you will know where you want to concentrate your photography. You will understand what features you need in a camera and where your current camera is limiting you. You will also understand the principles of different focal lengths for different images and how crop factor influences the focal length of a lens.  This is the time to make a list of all the things you MUST HAVE in a camera as well as those items which would be NICE TO HAVE if available. For instance lets assume you become most interested in sports photography. Your list of MUST HAVE items in a camera may include   * Fast shutter speed - 1/8000th.  * Fast continuous shutter - 10 or more frames per second.  * Fast accurate focusing and focus tracking  * 100mm to 500mm zoom lens  * In camera 5-axis sensor anti-shake system Now look at camera specs which meet this list and choose the ones that meet all the requirements. Then, from that shortlist choose which you like best because of its price, design, battery life, LED screen or whatever. You will then end up with the camera that suits your needs and makes you happy - and don't limit yourself to a Canon 1300D or a Nikon D3300 because your friend has one or the guy in the photo store recommends it for beginners. At that stage you are an experienced photographer and no longer a beginner!"}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-Flicker-alert-mean-on-my-Canon-EOS-750D", "question": "What does the Flicker alert mean on my Canon EOS 750D", "answers": [{"upvote": 3, "content": "You can find all error messages and a good deal of troubleshooting at the camera's manual.

While one photographer will swear by his Canon, another will insist her Nikon is the better option. So which camera is best? That's a matter of opinion\\u2014but that doesn't mean the individual camera brands don't have characteristics that may make them more suited to one type of photography or one type of photographer over the other.  When comparing Canon vs. Nikon side-by-side, there are a lot of similarities, like solid image quality and a wide range of accessories, but there's a lot of differences too\\u2014some subtle, others, not so much.  Canon Vs. Nikon: Sensors  Both Canon and Nikon offer cameras powered by similarly sized sensors, but there's a lot more that goes into image quality than just the size of the sensor. Just when one manufacturer seems to leap forward in sensor technology, the other catches up.  Most of Nikon's latest DSLRs use a new sensor design that allows them to eliminate the optical low pass filter without an abundance of moir\\u00e9, or distortion in fine lines and patterns. The filter is one more thing for the light to pass through before hitting the sensor, so eliminating it allows the camera to pick up more details and perform a bit better in low light. All of Nikon's 2015 APS-C sensor cameras don't use an optical low pass filter and a handful of their full frame professional models have eliminated it as well.  Canon's latest DSLRs, on the other hand, seem more focused on the megapixels. Most of Canon's DSLRs still use an optical low pass filter, though there are options like the Canon EOS 5DS R that do without. Their latest big announcements come in the form of full frame DSLRs with a whopping 50 megapixels. While judging a camera on megapixels alone is like judging a book by its cover, the EOS 5DS does capture a 8688 x 5792 resolution, where the Nikon D810 with 36 megapixels captures at most 7360 x 4912. The higher resolution allows for larger prints and more cropping without affecting the image quality.  While the two are focusing on different areas of sensor technology, Canon and Nikon DSLRs both have excellent image quality. That doesn't mean you'll get the exact same image when shot with two different cameras, though. Colors between the two options can be noticeably different, for example. Which one produces better color is a matter of personal preference\\u2014they are simply different, there's no right or wrong answer.  Canon Vs. Nikon: Speed  Canon and Nikon come in pretty even as far as the speed of their autofocus, but there's a subtle difference in their burst speed rates. Speed is hard to come by in DSLRs\\u2014where it's not uncommon to find a mirror-less camera with a 10 fps burst mode, DSLRs have more gear to move to take a picture and it's tougher to reach those high speeds.  Canon tends to have faster high-end DSLRs. The Canon EOS 7D Mark II ($1,799) hits an excellent 10 fps burst rate, making it one of the top DSLRs for sports shooters. Nikon's fastest APS-C camera, on the other hand, is capable of 6 fps, the D7200 ($1,199). Getting even further into the advanced options, Canon's full frame 1D X hits 14 fps, where the similar Nikon D4S gets 11 fps.  When it comes to the entry-level, more budget friendly models, however, Nikon offers more speed. It's usually just by a frame or two though, as when comparing the Nikon D7200's 6-7 fps to the Canon T6S's 5 fps.  Canon Vs. Nikon: Operation  Performance between the two brands is pretty similar, but there are some noticeable differences when it comes to operating each camera. The terminology on a Canon is different from that on a Nikon, for starters. The S on the Nikon's mode dial and the Tv on the Canon both indicate shutter priority mode, for example. Nikon also uses simpler terminology for autofocus modes\\u2014it's a bit simpler to remember what Continuous Autofocus is versus Al Servo Autofocus (they're both the same thing).  There's also often a significant difference in battery life, with Nikons generally able to take more shots on a single charge. For example, the Nikon D7200 has double the battery life of the similarly priced Canon T6S. That's not the case with every model, but, more often than not, Nikons have a better battery rating.  Canon Vs. Nikon: Video Quality  Canon, traditionally, has offered better video quality sooner. They were the first to develop a hybrid autofocus system allowing the camera to refocus while recording. Canon is known for their better autofocus tracking while recording, and they also have a selection of lenses designed specifically for video.  Answering which brand has the better video quality two years ago would have been much simpler. Where a few models ago Nikon didn't offer autofocus while recording video, their latest DSLRs offer continuous autofocus. Comparing models individually across the brands, Nikon even has some cameras with a 60 fps frame rate for smoother motion where the equivalent Canon has 30 fps. Canon traditionally offers the better video, but Nikon's latest developments put them much closer.  Canon Vs. Nikon: Options  When it comes to the more advanced DSLRs, there's pretty much a Canon to match every Nikon. That's not always the case though. Nikon hasn't yet come up with an answer to Canon's speedy 10 fps EOS 7D Mark II, and Nikon has a camera designed specifically for astrophotography, the D810A, where Canon's similar option has a smaller APS-C sensor.  When it comes to entry-level options, however, Canon's selection doesn't quite match up with Nikon's models. There are older Canon DSLRs available for around $500, but the current models (as listed on Canon's website) start at $899 for the body only for the EOS 60D. Nikon's D3300 offers full DSLR capability to beginners for a $650 list price\\u2014and that includes a kit lens. Canon offers a model priced fairly evenly with the enthusiast Nikon D7200, the T6S, but there are some pretty significant differences. The D7200 has no optical low pass filter, 51 autofocus points, 60 fps HD video, 6-7 fps burst shooting and an 1,100 shot battery life. The T6S, by comparison, has an optical low pass filter, 19 focus points, 30 fps HD video, 5 fps burst shots and half the battery life. Where the specs are close in the high-end models, Nikon often offers more in their entry and enthusiast options (though again, that's not always the case).  Canon Vs. Nikon: So which one is best?  Buying a DSLR is a bit different than buying a compact camera, because once you start accumulating lenses, it becomes much more expensive to change brands. Since the two brands operate a little differently (and with different terminology), switching would also mean relearning a few minor things.  So, then, which manufacturer is best? Which camera brand should you choose?  The answer? There isn't a winner\\u2014both Canon and Nikon offer excellent cameras with solid image quality. If one brand offered a better camera every time, the other would've gone out of business a long time ago.  But, that's not to say one brand isn't more suited to one person or the other. Beginners would likely be happy with a DSLR from either system\\u2014but Nikon offers a more affordable option that's still full of features and Nikon's terminology is a bit easier to understand when starting from scratch. Sports photographers can capture the action with a DSLR from either manufacturer\\u2014but Canon tends to offer more speed in their high end models. Quality videos can be shot on both\\u2014but Canon typically has a smoother autofocus and offers lenses specifically for cinema.  When choosing between camera brands, it's best to compare each camera individually\\u2014where Nikon may have a better entry-level DSLR, Canon may have a better DSLR for sports.  When making the choice between Canon vs. Nikon, here are a few things to consider:   * What is the most important thing in a camera to you? Speed? Resolution? Video quality?  * What does the manufacturer offer at your current experience level and for your current budget?  * What does the manufacturer offer that you might be looking to upgrade to in the future? While you probably won't be looking at the same options in five years, if they offer something in that range currently, they're likely to continue to making updates to that line.  * What lenses would you ideally like to add to your kit? Does that manufacturer offer those lenses? Canon or Nikon? Neither one is a bad choice, which means it's not an easy choice."}, {"upvote": 78, "content": "I see a lot of answers claiming \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" for photography in general. Do not get this line of thinking stuck in your head because it's not entirely true. In fact, to be honest, this statement is used many times by people who simply can't afford good gear and are jealous at those who can. If you can't afford good gear right now, that's fine; work with what you can afford and save up money to grow into better gear over time. The best camera is always the one you have with you and by this I mean, if you own a $6,500 Canon 1DX and it's sitting at home, your best camera may be the free one that came built into the phone in your pocket!  While it is true, skill is the most important aspect of almost anything, including photography, your gear and even more specifically, your lenses, are just as important. A good lens on an inexpensive camera is always better than a cheap lens on an expensive camera. If you're just starting out and looking for a camera for a beginner, try to think about what sort of photography you'll be doing. General photography such as family photos, photos of your friends, pets, etc.; landscape photography; wildlife photography; street photography, etc. If you don't know yet, that's okay but if you have a goal of developing skills specific to one of these styles, it will help with camera selection.  When getting started, I'd get something inexpensive but not so cheap that your photo quality ends up discouraging you altogether (again, this is where the \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" nonsense kicks in.) I'll cover a couple types and why they're good starter cameras. And with any camera you choose, always try to keep the camera out of \\\"automatic mode\\\" if possible so you begin to master the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  Point-and-Shoot or Camera Phone  These cameras are very inexpensive and with the newer smartphones, the camera is built right in and often takes better photos than the DSLR's from just a few years ago! This is the most inexpensive route to take (and may not cost a penny if you use the camera on your phone) and it helps you learn about composition, lighting, etc. If you're already past this point and want a camera you can grow into, the following are good options:  Traditional SLR's  I know, this is probably not what most people think of when deciding on a beginner's camera but I want to mention it because if you have one of these lying around in your house (parent's or grandparent's old camera, etc.), they're great for learning the basics of a camera with all of the digital stuff removed. SLR (single lens reflex) cameras aren't used much anymore because of the cost of operation, decreased photo quality, and lack of film processing labs, however, I think any aspiring photographer should own or at least use one because they are the \\\"original camera\\\", they are inexpensive, and they help give you a greater appreciation for the luxury of digital photography (not limited to 24-36 photos per roll, immediate results where you can see your photo seconds after taking it, easy and fast multiple frame shooting, and no cost by ruining a roll of film or wasting it on bad photos.) If you buy a traditional SLR 35mm camera, I'd go for something like the Nikon 35mm F2AS with a 50mm \\\"prime lens\\\", or similar. Here's a photo of one of mine:  Digital SLR's  Digital SLR's, or DSLR's, have been the most popular choice for many years now, they're easy to find used, and they're a good starting point in learning photography. These cameras are basically digital versions of the original SLR camera but offer much more flexibility and many more options. Whagt we're seeing right now, however, is a switch from DSLR's to \\\"mirrorless cameras\\\", including the very popular \\\"Micro Four Thirds\\\" cameras which use a smaller sensor, yet often outperform the DSLR's. I'll touch on those, below. Anyway, an inexpensive or used DSLR is a good choice for starting out and I'd recommend an entry level Canon DSLR such as one of the \\\"Rebel\\\" series cameras. I currently use a Canon 1DX which is NOT a beginner's camera, and my old Canon 5D Mark II (this is a great beginner's camera, easy to find, and inexpensive.) Here's a photo of the Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm prime lens attached:  Mirrorless Cameras  These cameras really are \\\"the future of photography\\\" although many professional photographers would scoff at you for even suggesting such a thing because just as it was when SLR's were phasing out, DSLR using pro's often get stuck in their ways and refuse to move with the times. Even today there are professional photographers who refuse to switch from SLR to DSLR! Mirrorless cameras are superior to DSLR's in almost every way: They have higher resolution (megapixels) for a fraction of the cost of DSLR's; there's no mirror flapping around making noise and causing camera vibration; they're smaller and easier to carry, many can shoot 4K and even Cinema 4K video (while Canon and Nikon refuse to adapt and offer this feature for a reasonable price in their DSLR's); and overall, they're less expensive. If you can afford one (they're often cheaper than many new DSLR's), go for it! I currently shoot with a Panasonic Lumix GH4 because I shoot photography AND I need to shoot 4K video and this camera does both. An even less expensive alternative is the Lumix GH3 which sells for around $500, a quarter of the price of the GH4. Here's a photo of the Lumix GH4, a \\\"mirrorless camera\\\":  Regardless of what you choose, unless it's a cheap $30 point-and-shoot or your phone's camera, try to make a decision on which camera format you want to grow into, otherwise you'll be wasting money on a camera and the expensive lenses that you'll end up not using when you switch to a different format.  Taking an introductory photography class or workshop is also a good idea when getting started as you'll more quickly learn the basics including aperture, exposure, shutter speed, composition, and editing. Good luck with your search and your journey into photography!"}, {"upvote": 2, "content": "You have to take into consideration that Canon is more and more shutting down its DSLR production. That means that the choice of new lenses and accessories is limited. So, if you want to buy a camera and start a system over years, a mirrorless camera like the Canon EOS R10 may be a better buy.  Apart from that, the 750D offers some decent features:   * 24 mp sensor (that is reasonable for an APS-C sensor - a higher resolution may give more noise at high ISO)  * 19 AF sensors, which isn't bad for moving objects  * A tilt and swivel touchscreen which is extremely nice for working from a tripod  * Hybrid CMOS AF III for good results when focussing in videos or in live mode  * Full HD Video  * WiFi connectivity (I love that) On the other hand, the camera has been introduced 5 years ago. Today's cameras can shoot 4K, and I have a 2019 EOS 250D with a so called Dual Pixel CMOS Autofocus which clearly works faster than the Hybrid CMOS AF of the 750D. The successor of the 750D is called 850D, and it features 4K video, better autofocus and a digital image stabilizer for video.  I did a quick price research, and it seems that a good, used EOS 850D costs 300 USD more than a 750D of the same condition.

Dual digits, such as the 90D, are prosumer. Three or four digit, Rebel, or Kiss, models, like the EOS Rebel T6/Kiss X80/1300D are consumer models.  That's Canon's marketing department speaking. And each company will have its own set of definitions. It's not perfect, either \\u2014 the 6D series is pretty much a prosumer series as well. Professionals can use Rebels \\u2014 pros know exactly what they need for any given job.  When a sports, music, or other performance space gives you a restriction like no professional cameras, they're not reading Canon's specs. They have an internal definition of what they consider a professional camera, and that's technically that.  It's quite common to lump all interchangeable lens cameras as professional and all others as consumer at this sort of venue. However, that's no hard and fast rule, and it's quite possible the person looking over your stuff won't think professional if they see an EOS Rebel with a small lens. A DSLR is still more likely to attract attention than a small MILC. People see my Pen-F and figure I'm some kind of hipster still shooting film, and they let me in. Not that a lens this size is useful for shooting a main stage.  For some years, I've taken a Sony RX10 Mark IV to music events and other no professional camera venues without any problem.  It's not a pro camera, but it definitely takes a good photo. Maybe too good. Some venues are starting to measure the length of the lens!  This one is a bit longer than 3\\u2033, even when collapsed.  Anyway, the key here is to check the fine print. For a four-day festival, I might bring along this as a smaller camera, just in case there's a crack down on bridge cameras like the Sony. But it's a very good idea to know ahead of time. If the information isn't on the event's web site, it doesn't hurt to call and ask. But if it's not in print, you can't be 100% certain.

Not only is the 1D X around $6,000 (body-only), but you're going to need expensive CFast cards for 4K video, and the 4K video on the thing is in gigantic Motion JPEG files, and not all that amazing anyway. If I wanted a 4K camera for video, I'd recommend either get a Panasonic GH4 or perhaps a Sony A7s mark II.  The Nikon D80 (2006) and the D3 (2007) are ancient models and don't shoot video. The D3s does shoot video, but only 720p, not full HD.  The EOS 7D (2009) is also fairly old. It can shoot 720p or 1080p video, but only 12 minutes at a time. The others here can shoot 29\\u203259\\u2033 without stopping \\u2014 that's a limit set to avoid paying a European camcorder tax. While it doesn't apply at all in the USA, most camera manufacturers (other than Panasonic, far as I know) impose this limit even on North American and Japanese models.  The Nikon D5300 isn't a bad choice for video. It's a few models old, it came out in 2003, the current model is the D5600, so it's may be available for a value price. But this line is a consumer line, APS-C sensor, and not terribly expensive. It can shoot video at 1080p up to 60fps\\u2026 not something you'd need for vlogging, but you want 60p for sports or other action video. Another advantage for vlogging, the D5300 has built-in WiFi, so it can be controlled wirelessly via an app. Most Canon and Nikon can be tethered via USB for remote control, and some have add-on controls, but it's handy to have it built-in.  I have the EOS 6D, and it produces amazing video, particularly in low light, where it blows away my far more expensive dedicated camcorders. The 6D right now is a good bargain, but mostly because everyone expects Canon to announce the 6D mark II Real Soon Now. The 6D also has built-in WiFi.  The EOS 5D mark III is the upgrade of Canon's breakthrough EOS 5D mark II. It's a great camera, one of the go-to standards for video-on-stills camera shooting. But while it's a solid choice if you can afford it, it's not the best choice. For one, it's been superceeded by the EOS 5D mark IV, if you're looking for a higher end model that shoots great video.  Of those on your list, the Canon EOS 80D would be my choice for anyone wanting a strong video option. Like the Nikon, it can shoot a variety of modes up to 1080p60. But the real advantage is in the sensor. This is Canon's second-generation mid-range DSLR with what they call a Dual Pixel sensor. This sensor splits each pixel into two separate photodiodes. Based on the way they're masked, each sensor pair works like a phase-detect autofocus sensor. So unlike every other DSLR on your list, the 80D can give you full performance autofocus in video, and things you usually just find on camcorders and mirrorless cameras, like follow-focus in video, etc. Dual Pixel is also used on Canon's 5D mark IV and all the new Cinema EOS video cameras. And the 80D also has built-in WiFi.  Far as the larger idea of a full camera system goes, you can't really go wrong with either Canon or Nikon. They have the two most complete lines of cameras and two most complete collection of lenses. However, neither offers a mirrorless option. So that means you're only shooting video from the back screen, not the viewfinder. And that only the 80D on your list has fully function video autofocus\\u2026 the others will AF in video, but it's on demand, not continuous, and it's often not very good. The phase detect sensors that DSLRs use are not available with the mirror up, which is what you have in video mode.  For one-person vlogging, keep in mind you are going to want to see yourself, which means either an add-on monitor while shooting or an articulated screen. The 80D and the D5300 both have fully articulated screens which let you see what you're recording from the front of the camera. The others do not, and will absolutely require an external monitor for vlogging."}, {"upvote": 8, "content": "One of these photos was taken with a brand new 5D mark IV.

Salary - CAPF AC is 5400 GP compared to EPFO Enforcement Officer which is 4800 GP but the salary difference is not that big in the initial part of the career. CAPF AC is a Gazzeted Post whereas Even APFC in EPFO is not a gazetted Officer. 2. Promotions - AC is the highest point of entry in CAPF's, therefore, they have better promotions as EPFO already has APFC (Assistant Provident Fund Commissioner) above Enforcement Officer, therefore the promotions are slow. Currently, BSF and CRPF AC's are promoted in 7\\u201312 years which is likely to reduced in future with regular cadre reviews and opening up of more deputation opportunities with the grant of OGAS.

So, NO comparison in terms of promotions.  1. Postings - CAPF(AC) will be posted in both normal areas(like Delhi, Jaipur) and hard areas like J&k, Chattisgarh etc whereas EO in EPFO will only be in major cities. 2. Family life - EO EPFO will have a better family life compared to CAPF(AC) however family life in CAPF will improve after you become DC. 3. Facilities - Officers get the best facilities in all organizations. Moreover, Facilities given in Defence & CAPF can't even be compared with any other Govt dept.. 4. Central Service - Govt is already contemplating to corporatize EPFO whereas it can't happen in CAPF. 5. Leadership - You will always be a leader in CAPF, You will command 130\\u2013140 people at the beginning of your career as Company Commander. If you want a Desk job with good family life then join EPFO and if you want to go outside, lead your troops at the cost of your family life, then come join CAPF's.

It went on for 30 minutes I suppose. The board had 5 members- two female members and 3 male. It was headed by one of the two female members.  As soon as I entered the interview room they welcomed me with big smile which made me very much comfortable, I could relax. As soon as I sat down my basic details were asked though everything was written on my DAF form . Anyway that's for the candidates benefit itself as it helped me ease up a bit. Following are some of the questions asked :  1. Where did you work previously?  2. What does your previous designation 'trainee decision scientist ' mean?  3. What is big data? How can big data be useful for a country like India?  4. Is working in startup better or in an established industry?  5. What is artificial intelligence?  6. What is reason for you to quit your job and join this service?  7. What are the pros and cons of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana bifurcation?  8. Which genre of books and movies do you watch?

What do you understand by basic structure? Name some of the features of our constitution that can be considered basic structure.  14. What are the different laws that fall under social security tag in India?  These are some of the questions that were asked (though not in the same order ). Can't remember anymore questions currently since it's been quite a while. Thus I can say that interview questions are not confined to the topics of social security alone but are more general in nature like that in civil services.

While in field, an Enforcement Officer has to visit industrial establishments to perform various inspections. EPFO scheme should be followed in companies otherwise penalty can be imposed on them.

While in desk profile, work is normal such as noting, drafting, files, administration work etc.  Coming on to Salary,  Basic salary is 47600 per month  Dearness Allowance is 17% of basic pay but when you join it will be more than 30%  HRA = 24% of basic pay  Travelling allowance is 3600, then there is DA on TA (17% of 3600)  So, In-Hand salary for a newly-joined Enforcement Officer is more than 60,000 per month.  Also , NPS : Government contribute 14% of (basic pay+DA) which is a part of gross salary. So, monthly gross salary is around 76000\\u201377000.  Note: When you guys join in 2021 , DA would be around 30% and HRA would be 27% . So, add 4000 - 5000 to your in-hand salary.  An Enforcement Officer get Government accommodation facility, CGHS facility, CGEGIS facility, briefcase facility and other perks.  Overall , the job is worth preparing for. It is not a 24 hour job.

Before this evening, I have never heard of Russ Jones, but now I will follow his analysis avidly (@RussInCheshire) [ https://twitter.com/RussInCheshire ]. He is informative and concise, and here is his 108-point summary of the last 5 days. It's worth the read, I promise:  TL;DR  1. Having spent a week insisting there was nothing wrong with avoiding \\u00a320 million in tax while being responsible for raising tax, Space Family Sunak have now concluded that for PR purposes their monumental, sickening greed is not compatible with British fairness  2. Sunak insisted he should not be associated with his spouse for tax purposes  3. This came as a shock to the rest of us, for whom our spouse's income affects every personal tax matter, every mortgage application, and all benefits claims  4. But you can't you expect poor, bewildered Sunak to understand the UK's rules, especially as it seems he's spent half his time as chancellor accidentally pledging allegiance to a foreign state for tax purposes, and promising to make USA his forever home  5. Parliamentary rules state MPs must be UK residents for tax purposes, so Sunak broke both MP's rules and the Ministerial Code, both resigning matters. He didn't resign  6. And then it was revealed Sunak had listed his wealth in the Cayman Islands to avoid even more domestic tax  7. He also failed to list his wife's \\u00a3690m stake in Russian businesses in the register of members' interests, even though the govt of which he is a senior member has given that company multiple contracts, and even though he told us all not to invest in Russia  8. So by Sunday we'd discovered Sunak was chancellor of one country while legally domiciled in another, claimed his wife didn't pay tax cos she was from a 3rd, got paid by a trust fund in a 4th, and was secretly breaking the rules of his job to give money to a 5th  9. So to prove he's now 100% committed to his job, his nation, and our struggle, he moved out of 11 Downing St and into one of his 4 giant luxury houses  10. Furiously glaring testicle Sajid Javid leaped to Sunak's defence, saying it would be morally wrong not to put up taxes  11. And then Javid admitted he'd spent 20 years as a non-dom avoiding paying those taxes, but there was nothing immoral about it  12. He then pressed SHIFT + F5 in his brain, and announced Tories would tackle aggressive tax avoidance and evasion, like all the stuff he did  13. Sunak, laser focussed on what was really pissing us off, decided divulging the tax status of a private individual is a criminal offence, and he HATES criminal offences, as we all know  14. So Boris Johnson \\u2013 yes, Boris Johnson \\u2013 ordered an ethics inquiry into Sunak  15. In all the kerfuffle, you may have missed the news about Nadine Dorries, which is understandable, since she's so dense no light can escape her  16. This week the exuberantly befuddled Nadine claimed opponents of her plan to privatise Channel 4 were ill informed  17. This claim is only slightly undermined by the fact she'd argued for the privatisation whilst still not having the faintest idea how Channel 4 operates  18. She said only 7% of TV production companies get money from Channel 4  19. It's actually over 50%  20. She said privatisation would finally force the majority of TV to be made outside London  21. 66% of Channel 4's UK content is made outside London  22. She said Channel 4 was currently a debt-risk and should be more like Netflix  23. Netflix is has over $15 billion of debts  24. She said Channel 4's advertising revenue has collapsed  25. All advertising collapsed during the pandemic. Channel 4's has recovered  26. She said Channel 4 becoming like the big streamers would protect its news service  27. None of the big streamers provides a news service  28. Let's visit Boris Johnson, a leaking bin-bag full of custard and Viagra, who began the week by heroically facing a terrifying inquisition from GBNews interviewers Esther McVey and Philip Davies, who just happen to be Tory MPs he gave jobs to  29. The interview probably breached Ofcom rules because we are in an election cycle, meaning press interviews must meet defined impartiality standards, such as not being a cosy chat between people with one brain between them  30. Johnson still lied, telling McVey he would introduce more lockdowns, despite promising MPs there would be no more lockdowns in Feb  31. Don your biohazard suits and let's see what's been happening to Priti Patel, answer to the question what did Bellatrix Lestrange do next?  32. This week Patel surprised us all with her first ever attempt at an apology, in this case over the Ukrainian visa fiasco  33. Let's be honest, even for a first attempt it wasn't a wildly successful apology  34. She admitted it was always easy to blame someone else, and then immediately blamed somebody else, claiming her insistence on shellshocked Ukrainian children completing byzantine visa application forms in a foreign language is not the problem  35. She insisted she couldn't let refugees into the country without visas just in case we ended up with a repeat of the Windrush scandal  36. The Windrush victims all had visas, but the Tories locked them up and kicked them out of the country anyway. Details schmetails  37. Patel boasted of a surge of staff to Calais to cope with applications  38. Reporters found she'd actually sent two guys, a table, and some crisps  39. So nobody can get in, and in news that will shock 48% of us and be ignored by the rest, nobody can get out either  40. Brexit is going so well that we had to close 23 miles of motorways in Kent  41. Instead of tackling crime, Kent police now have to patrol the 30-hour queues of HGVs to ensure weeping drivers don't simply abandon their vehicles as their livelihoods gently rot in the back  42. Boris Johnson, who won an election telling us Brexit was done, has now become so bored with Brexit not being done that he told German leaders he was ready to rip up the protocol  43. A committee of MPs concluded Brexit will make us more reliant on imported food, not less  44. But MPs found we probably can't that import food, cos by the time HGV drivers finally escape our shores, most of them have concluded it's not worth coming back  45. Such is the demand for food that as inflation reached a whopping 7%, the cost of basic foodstuffs rose by 12%  46. More than 550 foodbanks warned parliament they were at breaking point because supporters can no longer afford to give donations, and rising poverty sees centres overwhelmed by desperate demand  47. Foodbank use has doubled since January  48. John Redwood said the govt needed to sort out import/exports at Dover, finally catching up with where everybody else was in June 2016  49. Well, everybody except for Dominic Raab, a betwattled, box-faced Etch-a-Sketch dingbat who famously didn't know what Dover was for  50. This week Raab applied his fierce wisdom and keen intellect to a spiffing new Human Rights Act, and introducing something he was SURE would be better, because it would counter wokery, an indefinable, shape-shifting curse that makes people have basic manners  51. Raab's human rights plan was immediately condemned by the Joint Committee on Human Rights for weakening protections, for not being based on any evidence, for undermining the right to a fair trial, and for suggesting some classes of people should have fewer human rights  52. To Westminster, or maybe Pentonville: and despite a ban on MPs employing wives, 2 aides to gropy cocaine enthusiast David Warburton said they were unable to report his misconduct, because the person paid \\u00a352k of public money to handle complaints against him was his own wife  53. Fellow Tory MP Simon Hart defended this arrangement, claiming MPs - such as Simon Hart - who employed their wives delivered real value for money for the taxpayer, presumably on the basis that it minimises the risk of MPs facing costly criminal prosecutions  54. Even so, brace for another prosecution soon: it seems Warburton had secretly lobbied on behalf of an iffy Russian businessman without revealing that the Russian had given him a \\u00a3150,000 loan, and that he wasn't able to repay it  55. A former Tory minister said, This is symptomatic of a party in terminal decline. We are in a death spiral  56. Also on Monday\\u2026 no, really, we're just on Monday\\u2026 Tory MP Imran Ahmad Khan was found guilty of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy  57. Crispin Blunt, Tory head of the all-party group on LGBTQ+ rights, said the conviction of his friend Khan for abusing a child was an international scandal  58. So half the LGBTQ+ members resigned from the group, because Blunt refused to quit  59. And then Blunt quit anyway  60. So now, only a week after we had to cancel an LGBTQ conference because 100s of LGBTQ groups objected to Tory policy on \\\"conversion therapy\\\", a Tory MP has managed to make half the gay members of parliament stop being members of the group for gay parliamentarians  61. Meanwhile (former) Tory Rob Roberts is still acting as an independent MP, and refusing to step down from his seat a year after being suspended from the Commons for making repeated unwanted sexual advances  62. This is despite his suspension leading to a recall petition of his own voters, which he lost, therefor the regulations mean he now has to face a byelection. He still hasn't agreed to step down. He's just sat there, immoveable, undermining democracy  63. And so to the big news of the week, as Boris Johnson, a crapulous Honey Monster crammed into a suit he's borrowed for a tribunal, got a fixed penalty notice for attending parties during Covid lockdown, thus becoming the first sitting PM ever convicted of a breaking the law  64. Johnson still insists he hadn't lied to parliament, because he had naturally assumed the rolling stream of parties involving suitcases of booze, DJs, birthday cakes, party hats, tinsel and people playing on swings in the garden were simply standard govt meetings  65. Johnson wrote in the forward to the Ministerial Code that to win back the trust of the British people we must uphold the very highest standards of propriety, and this code sets out how  66. That very same Ministerial Code says ministers must resign if they lie to parliament  67. Johnson has told parliament the following lies:  a. All guidance was followed completely in No 10  b. There was no party and no Covid rules were broken  c. I have been repeatedly assured there were no parties  d. I follow the rules  e. There was no Christmas party. Covid rules have been followed at all times  f. I can understand how infuriating it must be to think that the people who have been setting the rules have not been following the rules, because I was also furious  68. Rishi Sunak \\u2013 last year's Best Available Tory whose primary skill now appears to be removing his jacket on Instagram \\u2013 also got fined, even though he had told parliament I did not attend any parties, which was another flagrant lie  69. Sunak didn't resign either  70. A whole fesnying (google it) of Tory MPs rushed out to independently tweet nearly identical messages of irrumating (don't google it) support for Johnson  71. These were led by be-Tangoed Party Chairman and adenoidal Morph cosplayer Oliver Dowden, who said he was fully behind the PM, the ideal position from which to stab him if the polling turns bad  72. It turns out it was absolutely right for Allegra Stratton to resign for making a joke about illegal parties she hadn't attended, but absolutely wrong for Boris Johnson or Rishi Sunak to resign for attending those illegal parties  73. Later, somebody who was genuinely prepared to admit that he is Grant Shapps was sent out to defend Johnson, immediately got confused by his brief, and said Johnson's actions were indefensible  74. Various floundering attempts at avoiding consequences were deployed, such as: Johnson can't resign cos we're at war  75. We're not at war. Although don't put it past them to declare war if it buys them an hour to clean up Johnson's latest stinky brown gift to the nation  76. The next attempt to keep Johnson in power came from a backbencher struck with the brilliant idea of stating in public that all the alternative potential Tory leaders were damaged people, which isn't exactly wrong, but is a monumentally stupid thing to admit out-loud  77. Another Tory argued Johnson couldn't resign, because that would send a message to Russia that we're a soft touch, somehow convincing himself Russia hadn't figured this out for themselves during all their years of giving money to Tories so they could avoid the law  78. Reports emerged that the world-leading PM wanted to recall parliament to discuss the risk of chemical weapons in Ukraine  79. And then reports emerged that Ukraine could go fuck itself, cos there was no way our world-leading PM wanted to face parliament right now  80. The next desperate gambit was to insist the PM hadn't broken any laws because he'd only broken the law for 9 minutes  81. So presumably the \\\"party of law and order\\\" is now behind the notion that an 8-minute burglary doesn't really count. Especially if nobody eats cake  82. Johnson, leader of this seemingly eternal gobshite jamboree, has already said he attended a party for 25 minutes, so that idea floundered, and the burgary is off  83. Next preposterous claim: the PM didn't understand the rules, and therefore wasn't immoral, merely stupid  84. Unfortunately the Tory MPs using this defence have merely shown they're immoral AND stupid  85. Gibbering ukulele fanatic and dying palm-tree Michael Fabricant had a go at defending the PM by insisting NHS doctors get pissed at work all the time  86. Hospitals don't allow alcohol on the premises \\u2013 not even in a suitcase  87. So in a year, we've gone from the people of Britain applauding health workers from their doorways to MPs abusing health workers to keep a bullshitting one-man game of Shag/Marry/Avoid in power  88. Gilead commander's wife Liz Truss was taking a break from leading the world on Ukraine to undertake the urgent task of being photographed sitting with eerie serenity in an haunted orchard, but she somehow found time to say she fully backs the PM  89. This doesn't entirely explain why she's registered 2 domain names for a future leadership bid  90. Despite Tory MPs attempting to overwhelm us with their panicky blunderbuss of fuckwittery, only 6% of the public believe the PM is honest, and 57% of us want him to resign  91. A rising number Tory MPs have had enough, OK with the 150,000 deaths, but not with this, and have begun sending letters of no-confidence to the 1922 committee  92. The public are being encouraged help matters along by writing a letter of complaint to their own Tory MP  93. This, of course, assumes their Tory MP isn't one of the ones who \\u2013 in this week alone \\u2013 have been found guilty of paedophilia, or suspended for railing coke and doing sexual assaults, or celebrated the anniversary of them refusing to step down for being handsy as fuck  94. Anyway, minor stories hidden behind the more obvious vortex of broiling chaos \\u2013 and do try to remember the missing \\u00a320 million of Sunak tax as you read these  95. UK benefits \\u2013 already the worst in Europe \\u2013 have now fallen further, reaching their lowest level for 50 years  96. Meanwhile Minister James Heappey complained that he couldn't survive on his \\u00a3106k salary  97. After every single Tory MP voted against making rented housing fit for human habitation, 1 in 8 privately rented homes are now a serious threat to people's health and safety  98. And after a decade of the lowest funding in its history, half of A&E patients now wait over 24 hours to be seen  99. 23% wait more than 2 days  100. 80% of hospitals reported storing patients in desperately needed ambulances because wards are packed with Covid cases  101. The NHS said spiralling Covid infections were being ignored for ideological reasons, cos stopping spindly, posturing mantis Jacob Rees-Mogg from whining is more important than public health  102. The NHS said the living with Covid policy was dooming the health service  103. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine said the Tories abandoning cheap, workable and basic public health measures in a pandemic was breaking the basic agreement to provide a health service  104. They said the NHS is in a deeper crisis than ever before  105. GP numbers have fallen every single year since the Tories promised to increase them in 2015  106. This week a study fond 44% of teachers said they plan to quit due to unmanageable workload, made worse by constant rolling absences caused by unconstrained Covid  107. And finally, the chairman of Enfield Conservatives has been suspended for dressing up in a Nazi uniform for perverse-themed parties, but said he didn't remember  108. I don't know about you, but I think I'd remember dressing up in a Nazi unform for a perverse-themed party  https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1514296763812831237.html  But it seems there was more, much more, brewing in the background, over the last 5 days:  https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-61097114 "}, {"upvote": 106, "content": "The Leavers vividly remember a history in which the UK was the strongest power around and would have the stronger side in any negotiation.

You clearly see this viewpoint in the way they want the negotiations to proceed - as a series of one-on-one-deals. But the rest of the EU sees things differently. And they refuse to be split up.  The reason the UK ended up being outside was not because it was outnumbered from the beginning and had no allies. It was that France and Germany saw deeper integration and transfer of power to a supranational level as a gain, a key to power, while the UK saw it as a loss and chose to be outside as much as possible.

All that remains is a mad rush to try get a deal with the EU in place.  Every indication is that the UK government is running down the clock to ensure a hard brexit (no deal) crashout of the transition period at the end of this year. They are backed by the extremist British tabloid press, Russian troll bots, US right wing backed propaganda machinery and what seems to be a bunch of corrupt and crooked politicians and British businessmen in spinning this economic, political and cultural disaster as a win for the UK and a victory over the EU.  They are playing heavily on the English nationalist sense of exceptionalism with heavy references to the world wars, without the slightest bit of irony that they are now the right wing threat and on the wrong side of morality.  It looks as though the UK government has already done a sweetheart deal with the USA, just playing the propaganda game with the British public to sell them all the changes that will come, including an effective privatisation of the NHS.  From their track record there has always been a roadmap. They have successfully herded their believers from the initial Vote Leave promises of what voting for leave meant to where they are now.  Back in 2016 the promise of what voting to leave meant was effectively continued full membership of the EU in all but name. Voters were assures massive economic benefits. The easiest deal in history. There would be full access to the EU single market and customs union. German car makers would rush to ensure this. A widespread belief was promoted that UK citizens would retain full freedom of movement but for British citizens only. The UK would hold all the cards. EU nationals would lose their freedom of movement into the UK. There would be no membership fees but with no economic impact, that was an unprecedented gain for the UK (Big Red Bus stated \\u00a3350 million a week net gain). The UK would have its cake and eat it.  Now these same brexit voters have always known that a hard brexit was going to happen. Challenge them on the economic losses already incurred by the UK, some \\u00a3135 billion wiped off GDP and \\u00a34 billion in cash spent on defending against a brexit crash out and they always voted to take the economic hardship of a hard brexit.  That is one huge leap from what they were flag-waving about initially and along with it comes the World War 2 rhetoric of being at war with the EU and war cabinets with Hitler mock-ups of EU leaders and other such distasteful propaganda being pushed and promoted onto the faithful who gleefully take it on board, share it on social media and vehemently argue their revised history and nationalist propaganda.  So the manipulation of the primary English voters has been extraordinary and very successful. It's a product of those forces both foreign and domestic and the huge money invested in getting the UK out of the EU and its tax avoidance clampdown.  Those in control of the agenda will continue to be very clever about it. The privatisation of the NHS will be swamped with detail, making it too confusing for the public to understand the reality while they will continue to have frontline staff comfortably wearing NHS branded clothing even though they work for private companies. There will be a subtle change in language. The NHS will be transformed into how mobile phone companies work: They don't own the infrastructure, they are really just a brand and billing agency, the customer-facing front end. Similarly the NHS will transform into a manager of supplier bids and a payments agency with most of it outsources, function by function over time.  There will be a time where we always knew that private companies were actually doing all the work in the NHS and at that tipping point, the public will have accepted the privatisation of the NHS and then will come the exceptions to the service, the things that are covered by the NHS and the things that are not covered and need to be paid for privately.  Over time the various funding crises of the service will require a more streamlined service in order to remain financial viable and so the list of what the NHS covers for free will shrink and the private side will grow.  At some point, as what happened with British Telecom, the NHS will be effectively a private monopoly with unfair state aid and just like O2 was separated out of BT for similar reasons, parts of the NHS will be required to separate out because of the unfair advantage.  This is the trajectory that the UK is clearly on. In the right wing USA terms it is a socialist country and they will be freeing the UK of its horrific socialist setbacks. In truth, it's taking a valuable economy currently protected by the biggest single market on the planet, the EU, and stripped of that protection, asset stripping the national assets and protected industries.  Farming is also on the agenda and with inferior standards to the EU, the UK can lose its environmental and animal welfare protections to reduce its standards to the environmentally damaging, cruel US regime. This is exactly why the EU is wanting to enforce a level playingfield on the Brexit negotiations as it doesn't want to have a situation where non-compliant, inferior food junk from the UK has a backdoor into the EU market at reduced prices and inferior standards.  This is why a hard brexit is really the only way forward, or at least an incredibly weak and inferior UK/EU deal. It's inevitable that the EU will need to enforce strict controls over the UK borders and it's inevitable that this will be used by the UK right wing as proof that the EU is attacking the UK and it's therefore an enemy of the the UK but the fabulous special relationship with the USA means that our ally and friend will come rushing to our rescue and it's only right that we align with the USA and open our markets to their industry.  That's the game plan it seems.  No deal, crash out, US take-over of UK assets. Done deal. The snouts in the trough in Westminster get fabulous payouts, everyone is happy.

But all the evidence points to it being somewhere between a disaster and a complete disaster."}, {"upvote": 32, "content": "On the surface, little has changed, mainly down to a number of things which I will list:  1. Transition period. We are halfway through the new one. Nothing has changed, other than the UK no longer has a vote or voice in laws etc coming out of the EU. 2. In reality, for both sides, the EU isn't that important. Trade goes on despite interference from the EU, not because of it. Look at how successful non-EU nations are at trading with each other! 3. Indifference from the majority of the population. By now, most don't give a damn whether the UK is in or out of the EU. On both sides of the debate and Channel, a majority have had enough of the debate and posturing, and just want it over and done with so they can get on with their lives. 4. Corvid-19. This pandemic has made many realise what's really important in their lives. The farce surrounding Brexit (on both sides) has been relegated to a sideshow. However, beneath the surface, we've already begun to see changes. The UK Government cannot blame its incompetences on the EU. Covid-19 has magnified differences in ability/approach between not just the UK/EU but, more damagingly, between member states. The default position in times of trouble has reinforced again the importance of the nation-state, delivering perhaps even a mortal blow to the EU dream of \\u2018ever-closer union.' Just look at how the EU moved from the myth of unity and solidarity to beggar-thy-neighbour when it came to PPE. The recent decision of Germany to effectively hamstring the ECB for a period, couldn't have come at a worse time. Good luck with getting Germany to underwrite debt mutualisation. Long-held tensions are moving from simmering to a roiling boil.  Arguments as to who makes up the UK contribution and/or takes a reduction in benefits received have simply been kicked down the road, as per usual. You don't need to be a seer to figure out a shit-storm of new taxes and regulations to harmonise taxation is coming. I pity Ireland. Not only are they now a nett payer but will be forced (probably) to give up its low tax position. I wonder where multi-national will move their HO's too?  Another change, albeit a slow one, is a realisation within the EU hierarchy that Johnson's Government is a different animal to May's. Even so, too many of the EU elite still think of the UK as some sort of supplicant/vassal/naughty child (pick your own description) instead of an equal and powerful neighbour. The June review of \\u2018progress' in transition talks will be educational for all concerned and may provide a good indicator of what will ultimately occur. I write \\u2018may' as when it comes to last-minute brinkmanship, the EU has few betters.  The tsunami of bankruptcies, closed businesses and unemployment due to hit Europe (not just the EU, which isn't Europe no matter how much it tries to convince us it is) will completely change the dynamic nations have with the EU, both internally and externally.  I'm being called by my better half, so will stop here but I could go on! We live in very interesting, literally historic, times.

Tom McTague, Journalist, 23 December 2020  The European Commission's press release and summary compares the EU-UK Trade & Security Agreement with the UK's previous EU membership. Hardworking families will lose exiting rights and businesses have cross border transaction costs.  There will now be visa for some visits for UK passport holders to the EU member states. Pet passports end. There will be more limited study rights. UK passport holders will need a blank page in their passport for border stamps.  Frictionless trade in goods ends. Tariff free and quota free imports remain for qualifying goods. There will be new SPS checks on agri-food, plants and livestock. Fisheries will have new agreements, changes in 2026 and transitional arrangements.  Financial passporting ends as does current professional qualification recognition. Current cabotage rights for UK hauliers and UK airline end and replaced with specific new arrangements.  The UK's participation in the single energy market and ERASMUS student programmes also end.

It has been falsely claimed that the EU's Free Movement of Labour has caused the UK to lose control of its borders, but this claim has only succeeded because too many have little or no understanding of how it works. It allows people from any EU state to go to any other EU state to look for work for a period of three months, after that three months, if the person is not gainfully employed, in education or otherwise financially self-sufficient, they must return to their state of origin - if they do not, the UK government has every right to deport them.  People have claimed that this is unworkable because it's impossible to know who's coming and going and where they are, however this is just a lazy answer. The truth is that we were never part of the Schengen agreement, so we have every right to do as many border checks as we choose to secure our borders, and as for knowing where they are, if they are claiming benefits or living in council houses (as the lead pushers of Brexit have implied), then we should know exactly where the fuck they are.  The only change that actually happens on the day the UK finally leaves the EU is that EU27 citizens join the ranks of the all those non-EU people, and they will be subject to the same immigration processes as everyone else who isn't a British citizen.  It may well be the case that the government, whoever that turns out to be, may change immigration laws in the future, though the UK government could have changed rules for non-EU citizens at any time, the EU never had any influence on this subject as I stated at the very beginning.  Some in the Brexiteer ranks are saying that this is a good thing because East Europeans have been stealing British jobs by undercutting British wages, but the truth is that in a number of industries, East European workers have been doing jobs that the British unemployed refuse to do. A number of agricultural landowners have responded already to the lack of East Europeans not by increasing wages to attract Brits in because they know that would be fruitless, they are instead investing in technology to do the work that human beings with funny accents used to do.

Let me get this straight. An NHS nurse who is an EU national and happens to be on holiday won't be able to get back into the UK? Are you serious? What an absolute disgrace of a government. David Lammy MP, Labour - Tottenham, 18 August 2019  The legislation paving the way for ending freedom of movement has not yet reached the statute of book. On top of that, there is no legislation to replace freedom of movement with an alternative.  Theresa May's government accepted that the new immigration system and border controls will not be ready for any abrupt change now envisaged by Ms Patel - so they planned to implement a temporary transition phase.  Well known for her far right beliefs and professional misconduct  [1] , Ms Patel has still to clarify whether these transition plans will still be implemented unchanged or she's going to implement something completely different.  Since 29 March 2019, Ms Patel's Home Office has managed to process just over 1 million EU Settlement Scheme applications. This leaves over 2 million EU citizens without a status. That's two million EU citizens who, if freedom of movement is really ending abruptly on 31 October 2019, will have no official proof that they have the right to live and work in the UK. Recall the hostile environment pioneered by the Mrs May leading to the Windrush Scandal.  Disgraced former international development secretary, Ms Patel is often seen smiling for the cameras.

But I imagine you're wondering that because of his Completed Daiguren Hy\\u014drinmaru. So already big problems here even outside the immense gap of Spiritual Power, Aizen is immortal, Aizen has his \\\"Perfect Hypnosis\\\". Let's put this aside to make the fight more interesting.  Completed Daiguren Hy\\u014drinmaru: Following the final battle against Aizen, Hitsugaya trained and strengthened his Bankai considerably, completing its development after eighteen months of hard work. Sometime later during his battle against Gerard Valkyrie, Hitsugaya states that Daiguren Hy\\u014drinmaru reaches completion when the last petal of his ice flowers falls. He claims that his power was not mature enough to use his Bankai to its fullest, but he managed to age himself to an adult body when it reached completion in order to achieve its full potential. As an adult using his Bankai, Hitsugaya is tall and lanky, and has ice covering his shoulders, forearms, and knees. So already, first weakness, \\\"Hitsugaya states that Daiguren Hy\\u014drinmaru reaches completion when the last petal of his ice flowers falls\\\", he must wait for the limit of his Bankai to then reach a new stage. In addition, he has a very short time limit in this form.  Flash-Freezing: In his matured form, Hitsugaya can flash-freeze extremely large objects at a distance with a simple hand gesture; this also extends to objects that his sword cuts. Additionally, anything that he freezes will have all of its functions and abilities negated. If anyone touches Hitsugaya while he is in this form, they will be flash-frozen as well.  Shikai Hy\\u014dketsu : In his matured form, Hitsugaya can freeze all matter in front of him after four seconds of building up his power. Four seconds is really long against someone like Aizen.  This Hitsugaya is problematic if Aizen goes into melee combat, overall he is similar to Yamamoto Bankai, but at the end of the day, Aizen wins for the reasons I have already said above. Aizen has Kido, Shikai, immense Reiatsu, Immortality, and I assume that Aizen gives him time to reach this form and use his powers. But Eos Aizen has become so powerful that he can use his Shikai even on Yhwach and can cast the strongest Kid\\u014d at full power effortlessly, including using Had\\u014d #90 while he was still restrained to a Reiatsu-suppressing chair, and Had\\u014d #99, the most powerful offensive spell of all.

Under normal circumstances, Kakashi won't be able to see Byakuya, withstand his spiritual pressere or even touch him for he will get impaled from just that.  But for the sake of a battle to happen, if we take away all the above things mentioned, then a short fight will happen. Kakashi is a pretty strong ninja. But in bleach, even early Chad is physically much stronger than Kakashi. Byakuya outclasses him in physical strength and swordsmanship completely. And also, Kakashi can only avoid the sword swings for zanpakuto cut through anything kakashi has.  Flash step can not only dodge anything but also can cut a throat neat and clean. Kamui is dangerous but Byakuya won't hesitate to go for the kill from the beginning itself like he did to the fullbringing guy. Besides, he has kido. And this:  Kakashi cannot outrun nor withstand it. Byakuya has a clear and very high upper hand.  I haven't considered DMS Kakashi because that isn't Kakashi's true power. It lasted for a few minutes only and was just granted. Its like taking Nightmare Luffy for comparison when we talk about a battle between Luffy and someone else. Besides, the extend of DMS powers were not clear.  Kakashi is no doubt a badass, perhaps a far greater one in Naruto than Naruto shippuden.

Before I start the assertions, they are a few things that I want to debunk before I get comments claiming that I was biased or something like that.    %3E Debunk A: Narratively speaking, Kuvira is the strongest villain as she is the last main villain in the overall series. If I'm being honest, this gotta be the shittest claim I've heard tbh. The ATLA verse isn't based on narrative scalings unless they are pure statements of someone being the pinnacle of something, like the avatar being the strongest or Toph being narrative seen to be the strongest earthbender. It's not only narratively supported with the fact that Toph is the greatest earthbender though, as she consistently boasts about it and is written by Bryke to be the strongest.  Just trying to state that the new-gen %3E previous-gen solely based on narrative purposes is just ass\\u2026 very much so. While I did say I had a few things to debunk that were actually the only one, it's far too narratively inconsistent by feats, statements, and retcons throughout the series to keep on thinking that a single narrative argument can back up your claims.    %3E Kuvira's assertion B4 Kuvira actually has some good feats, as she had been shown to overpower base PTSD Korra who still had great control over the 4 elements, while suppressed.  Even though she was originally overpowering her, she got absolutely slammed by AS Korra (PTSD\\u2014nerf) and would've died if it weren't for the poison kicking in.  During Bryan and Mike's Q&A, they said that Toph (presumably Old Toph as this refers to B4 where Kuvira is the villain) would at least give a good fight for Kuvira under the premise that Kuvira herself would win.  For now, take the statement however you want, whether or so you want to believe that this implies all versions of Toph %3C Kuvira. Kuvira was also blatantly seen to be superior to everyone on the new Team Avatar (beside Korra), as Kuvira overpowering her base state should be seen as a better feat than what they have accomplished.    %3E Bumi's affirmation Old Bumi is the only variant that has feats and not pure hype, I'll be using him. Bumi has been shown to be the 2nd strongest Lotus member (based on showings), as he was seen in the comics to stalemate 14 yr Toph, who was proclaimed to be the greatest earthbender at this age.  Prior to this and during the eclipse, Bumi was shown chucking and tossing buildings that were more or less the size of an average building in Republic City.  So this basically means that this feat that Bumi performed was %3E to Lin, Suyin, Bolin, and other metal benders cutting down a building via earthbending.  And if you're wondering why this is relevant, is due to Suyin being able to stalemate Kuvira for a while (this was prime Kuvira, she didn't get stronger at all after this matchup, and remained the same in the final fight against Korra. Korra never used AS in the final fight, as it would have been an astronomical stomp.)   %3E Conclusion So by feats & what we've seen and what's been stated throughout the series, Bumi should take the W and narrative arguments can't be used in Kuvira's scaling as she isn't an Avatar/spirit or has been stated to be capable of doing something incapable of any previous bender (besides using a mecha).

This was during his fight with Aura Michibane.

He also used Hado#99, Goryutenmetsu\\u2026  He knows how to recreate the Hogyoku\\u2026  In episode 300 of the anime, he told Aizen that he couldn't control the Hougyoku 100 years ago, but he can now. Even by just being around it, a person is lead to achieve their potential, and his potential as a scientist, genius, warrior and Shinigami with a restructuring bankai is ridiculous.  He can carry any number of Gigais and his use of them can deceive the likes of Aizen(his Genius and sensing abilities)\\u2026  In the novel he was also stated to be able to recreate the Hogyoku. He was also listed among the scientists who could create a better version of Hikone by themselves. Imagine if he created his own version and gave him a Hogyoku.  His Kid\\u014d is incredible, almost killing Aizen and then facilitating his sealing. He creates spells like it's a game.  He was also stated to have Kido which can one-shot Shinigami-Aizen level opponents.  INTELLECT  The Quincy label him as the strategist of perpetual adaptation. And a special war power based on his intellect alone. This means that Urahara can think of endless possibilities and adapt continuously.  He can calculate for every single possibility\\u2026 this is ridiculous and excessive but the highest form of calculating intelligence for sure. He already has 1000 or 10,000 plans stored up for any situation:  And can generate infinite strategies:  CFYOW Novel.  He's considered as dangerous as characters like Aizen and Ichibe\\u2026  OTHER SKILLS  He can keep up with Yoruichi in hakuda and Hoh\\u014d combat, since they played and trained together growing up (don't get me wrong, they are not equals lol Yoruichi is a BEAST), and he was a leader in onmitsukido , an organization specializing in Hoh\\u014d(speed), stealth and hakuda(Martial Arts). It should be noted that he is EXTREMELY good at physical combat, he trained with Yoruichi The Flash Goddess, and Extreme Hakuda and Stealth master continuously:  Even when poisoned, he could still keep Askin on his toes:  Cleanly blitzes Askin:  Through his skills he is on par with the strongest captains, especially in Kid\\u014d. Through his hax bankai and strategy, he rivals the elites (took out Askin, helped to seal Aizen\\u2026 so elites\\ud83e\\udd14). With science and inventions, he steps in the realm of the gods (Hougyoku can evolve one into a god, he aided in creating the seals that bind Aizen's god-tier reiatsu and his intellect surpasses Aizen's and Mayuri's.) Mayuri created Nemu, who was able to overload the body of Pernida via one of her organs, and Aizen, well he used Hougyoku to become a transcendent being.  SHIKAI\\u2026  His Shikai manipulates malleable red energy\\ud83d\\udd25\\ud83d\\udd25  AWAKEN BENEHIME  He can emit red energy blasts with his own calculated power, speed and potency. Scream!  BLOOD MIST SHIELD  TSUPPANE BENEHIME  After analyzing the energy and muscle of the opponent, he can render their attack useless..  SHIBARI  PLAY WITH FIRE  BANKAI\\u2026  KANON BIRAKI BENEHIME ARATAME  Urahara's bankai can restructure matter. He even used it to fix an eye which was completely gone, so he can even manipulate particles/fundamental matter(since he remade an eye which was completely gone).  So Urahara \\u2018s strength is not linear, but versatile and it REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT HE WANTS TO DO. He is a character whose power depends on his ambition and alignment, like Aizen. So I see no limits to the things he could achieve if he puts his mind to it. Even Aizen tried to kill him(above), given Kisuke's potential and claim to be able to wield the Hogyoku.  \\ud83c\\udf1fBonus:  1. He can read attacks on the level of muscle fibres and \\u2018particles' in the heat of battle: 2. Aizen praises Urahara for both his Kido and Intellect in Fake Karakura Town. He made a technique that could probably kill any Captain by sealing Reiatsu in their wrists and making them implode.  3. His portable Gigai substitution technique is so incredible, it worked perfectly against Aizen(who already knew about it) but was confident he had killed Urahara.  4. His bankai ignores durability and can modify him for healing or even empowerment:  5. His Bankai could create a path for Grimmjow to travel, while fighting Askin \\ud83d\\udc4d\\ud83c\\udffe  He also restructured the ground to allow Grimmjow to emerge from below\\u2026  6. Aizen admits to Kisuke's superior intellect:  7. Askin received approximately 2 other Sternritters' Vollstandig due to Auswahlen. To his base, he had about 2 Vollstandig added and in his own Vollstandig form, he's a massive multiplier(like Bankai) upon that. With all this, Urahara's bankai ignored his power level and durability.  8. He can also use Bakudo#58 to sense opponents in other dimensions as Mayuri did in Can't Fear Your Own World ll part 17. He sensed that targets had vanished into the Valley of Screams(which is surrounded by Garganta space) while he was in Soul Society.  9. There is no end to his intelligence feats which is why I only listed a few. The manga and novels are flooded with them. He can also predict events before they happen and make countermeasures way ahead of time, as a visionary. For example\\u2026  And  10. He created Nova, who has the ability to teleport, manipulate space by creating and linking portals and create his own parallel dimension\\u2026 in the anime.  11. Some other creations\\u2026  Flying carpet  Spiritual energy insulating cloak\\u2026  12. Urahara at full power and potential, is essentially unstoppable. With the power of Hogyoku(endless evolution, which he could potentially give to himself, based on his choice and will), his ability to create devices which work on gods, his perpetual(infinite) adaptation, his raw Genius, mastery of every Shinigami art (magic, sword, martial arts and speed) among other things, his potential is extremely high.  \\ud83e\\udd42 cheers!\\ud83d\\udd25\\ud83d\\udd25"}, {"upvote": 22, "content": "All For One VS STARRK??

Not to put down the other Quorans - I think they give reasonable answers but with some discrepancies.  So, I've never owned a Canon 5D. In 2016, I purchased a Canon 7D Mark II and I loved it. It's not a full frame - it has an APS-C sensor, so it's significantly smaller than the sensor on the current 5D. Despite this, it handles light fairly well, and you can turn up the ISO quite a bit before you start seeing artifacts in low light scenarios.  It has an input for a mic, the standard 1/4 jack, not the professional XLR input. It does full 1080p HD up to 60 frames per second. These specs are what made me sell it and get a Sony A7R2 (more on this later).  The current 5D, the Mark 4 is outstanding. That's probably why it's been used in cinema level productions. It does 4K resolution and has a high dynamic range with means that it can better process dark tones, light tones and all the shades in between. It has great color reproduction as well. It has everything a film maker needs to make a professional production.  So, to answer your question, the Canon 5D is the winner by far.  But here's the thing. When I see questions like this, I'm almost certain that the person asking is making a low-budget, amateur production. I have no issue with this as that is what I've done for years but it does change my answer a bit.  To put it bluntly, if you're an amateur using either of these cameras - you're not going to use them to their full potential. In fact, your production would still more than likely look amateur even if you were given a RED One Dragon.  It's all about technique. It's about lighting, your set, your actors, your story, your audio, etc, etc. Most new people (including myself at one time) think that a nice camera will solve ALL your problems - it won't, trust me. In fact, I'm certain that I could give an old Sony Handicam to a professional and 10 times out of 10, the resulting product would outshine anything the amateur does with a 5D.  Before you think I'm being a jerk - here's why;   * You probably won't have the lenses for the camera. Lenses are in my opinion, one of the most valuable parts of the camera (and many times, more expensive than the camera body). Most amateurs use the crappy kit lens that comes in a bundle with the camera. It's basically a waste of time as the bundled lens specs are far below the full potential of the camera. It's like having a Ferrari with $40 tires on it.  * Many amateurs don't have a decent tripod, steadicam and the other equipment you need to get that \\u2018cinematic look'  * You probably don't have good lighting  * You need computing power to process and edit the video you will shoot - you need the software, the hard drive space, etc. You're going to need a lot of everything if you're going to be editing even the 7D video. So if you are a pro just trying to keep production costs down - go with the 7D\\u2026 but wouldn't a pro just hire a camera man instead of using part of their budget to buy an expensive camera and the system that goes with it?  My advice to you - unless you'll be competing at a film festival - see what you can do with a camera you have now. Do you have a smart phone that does HD at the very least? Great. Do you have an audio recorder and mic laying around? Awesome! Make sure your script's perfect, and get some of your bros (I usually say not to do this, but this is the very beginning) who want to be in a short film. Put your phone on a low cost Vivitar tripod with one of those $10 adapters. Shoot the film, edit it, bingo. When you feel like you have maxed the potential of that camera, then you can move on.  Why did I sell my 7D? I simply sold it because I needed 4K resolution and a full frame sensor for my productions. If it hadn't been for these requirements, I would still be using it to this day, 3 years later."}, {"upvote": 7, "content": "Absolutely. Most tv and movies are shit with a single camera.

The primary difference between it and newer cameras is the image processor and features.

The features of cameras newer than the 60D tend to be relatively insignificant \\u2013 the 60D functions well enough for anyone with sufficient photographic skills, and any drawbacks can [mostly] be compensated for by hacking it with Magic Lantern or by using alternative techniques and tools. For examples, if a newer camera does auto-HDR, the 60D can be hacked or you can do manual HDR; or if a newer camera has a timer, you can use a $12 intervalometer.  Granted, number of autofocus points, sensor size, and similar features could provide significant advantage. Apples to apples, those are not quite in the same realm of comparison.  The 60D remains a good camera, and will continue to be good for several years.  As usual, glass and photographer skill make more difference than camera body."}, {"upvote": 4, "content": "It's not really clear what you don't like about it, just the dynamic range, hence the bracketing and HDR merge, or the lack of details if viewed at 100%? The photos posted here don't really tell us what is you are objecting too, is it even related to the camera, or your own technique?  I jumped from the 40D (which I still use) to the 6D and then 5D MKIII. I love my 6D and it stayed as a second body and for landscapes when travelling as it's much lighter than any of the 5Dx series and slightly better in low light than the 5D MKIII, Really can't go wrong with it. The 5D MKIII is much more of a great all rounder though, street photos, action, birds in flight, all reasonable, the 6D is better for more sedate subjects.  I picked up a 5DSR and it is an amazing camera for detail in static objects. A little tricky to use, as all your shutter speed and DOF assumptions need to change, you really need to check the image at 100% to ensure sharpness until you get used to this, however the biggest issue for me is not related to the camera at all, it's the resolution, it's huge! As a result almost nobody ever sees the photos in all their glory! When publishing them (unless you plan to really crop in) then a lot of the detail is lost in the conversion process to whatever resolution you intend to display them in. If they are for web use or to be displayed on a typical panel at 1080p then all those delicious details you really loved are lost in the down sample. You end up either cropping the hell out of them to highlight the details you cared about or putting them online and letting the viewer zoom in and see all the details, which nobody ever bothers to do. Think watching a 4K movie on a 1080p TV. If you print however it's can be a different story it makes a difference (to a point).  Also be aware that the 5DSR has (subjectively) poorer ISO than the 6D, MKIII and MKIV, ISO 3200 is about as high as you ever wish to go and most of the time I don't like to exceed the low thousands, which can be challenging, requiring faster lenses. Diffraction becomes an issue earlier also, I'm scared to go above f/11 most of the time for fear of 50MP of soft images. There is nothing more disappointing that getting home and that pin sharp looking image that gets softer and softer as you zoom in.  That said when you nail it, it really is a thing of beauty, the detail is extraordinary, but you really need decent lenses to get the most out of it and a decent monitor to view it on. The 5DSR and the 11\\u201324mm is a formidable (but heavy and expensive) combination and with the 100\\u2013400mm you do macro and with some cropping you can do macro at 10 feet away ;-) My favourite light weight landscape lens with this is the beautiful 16\\u201335mm F/4L.  The move to full frame is a bit of a marketing game, OK better ISO but APS-C is catching up fast and then there is the cost of new lenses, as you'll need to get EF lenses. Once you are at equivalent resolution (say 1080p on your monitor) you would be pushed to tell the difference between the 6D, 5DMKIII,5DS/R and IV, expect for ever improving dynamic range.  You don't mention how many lenses you have but if they are EF-S they won't work on any of your FF bodies. If you've not really heavily invested in Canon EF glass, then newer bodies from Nikon and various others have better\\u2026.almost everything for landscape (Pentax K1, Nikon D750 etc) Not enough to persuade me to jump ship but if was just starting out I'd probably go with something else but as the camera companies are forever playing leapfrog with each other, it matters little, whatever you buy somebody has better one out tomorrow, I prefer Canon's handling.  Since I regally shoot with all four of these bodies I'd choose the 5D MKIV right now for one very important reason, you really get a hell of a lot more latitude in the RAW files than any previous Canon camera, especially in the shadows. Gone are the bad old days of exposing for the highlights to find your shadows are a mess of noise and banding in when you lift them in post. Seems kind of lazy, but saves an awful lot of messing about bracketing or with filters in the field (which I hate, especially when travelling or when it rains) and I'd expect the 6D MK 2 to benefit in the same way, makes a massive difference to what you can do with almost every shot you take and allows you more more latitude when exposing to the right. Canon is still behind Nikon and Sony on this front but not by much. The one and only thing I don't like on the MKIV is it has a poor battery life compared to the 6D/MKIII, don't get me wrong it's still great but I'm used to a single battery covering me all day on the MKIII the MKIV chews through them much quicker even with all the Wifi/GPS turned off, still way better than the Sony A7RII or any of the other mirrorless bodies I own.  That said, it's hard to buy a bad camera at the 6D price point, anything you buy from any manufacturer will take amazing images in just about any conditions from dusk till dawn, as long as you know how to do so and here is the rub. Lenses and technique combined with decent post processing skills will help more than any new camera body. Limitations in ISO, dynamic range and all the other things that improve in new bodies are just walls you hit, the difference is you hit them later on pro/enthusiast gear, they can be easily overcome using fairly standard techniques such as bracketing, filters, longer exposures at lower ISO etc.Especially in landscape where you are usually tied to a tripod, so easy to do. Newer cameras eliminate a lot of this messing about so us lazy consumers want them, however very difficult replicate the sharpness of a decent lens or the beautiful bokeh on a F1.2 lens in post ;-)  Hope this helps and your enjoy your trip.  ChrisC"}, {"upvote": 8, "content": "Why did you pick 24 fps? Are you trying to be cinematic? Does the shoot you are doing really call for that?  The 180-rules says that the frames of your film will look jerky if you are faster than 1/50th for the shutter speed, and blurry if you are slower than that. We have been trained for how much blur should exist by generations of movies that set the shutter speed to be double the fps. This is what looks right.  Going faster than 1/50th will give you the jerky and frenetic motion that you saw in the start of Saving Private Ryan. I can't think of any movie that would choose to go slower than 1/50 (technically, slower than 1/48th, but you are not using a film camera).  Aperture and ND filters (and ISO is the lighting is a bit dim) are really the only ways you have for varying the exposure. And if you have a aperture you are trying to achieve (like strong DOF, thus fully open aperture), you really only have ND filters in normal lighting.  You also need to be diligent about the white balance. Canon 60D saves a compressed file, not RAW video. So you have less leeway in color grading, so you need to get it right in-camera.  Be diligent about focus too. You will need to be on manual. And if the distance to the camera is changing during the shot, you will need to get a follow-focus rig and someone to operate that while you operate the camera (although on a tripod, you can probably do both yourself).  And the sound on a DSLR is perfectly fine as a scratch track. But it is not going to work as the recorded audio for the final edit. You need to record sound externally.  And sometimes the camera is idle too long and the sensor has to shut down. When the screen goes dark because you have been idle, you need to cycle the power on the camera.

Depending on how much light you have available, it may or may not be enough to shoot handheld. The 18\\u2013135 has image stabilization, whereas there are different versions of the Tamron with and without, and the Canon 50mm f/1.4 does not have it.  Do some math.

If the former, a new lens isn't going to be very helpful in that little light. If the latter, it may.  If you are looking at lenses without image stabilization, the 18\\u2013135 IS will probably do better for still pictures in low light than the Tamron. The Canon 50mm has a much larger aperture and will probably let you shoot in lower light - but very large apertures will give you a very narrow depth of field. Sometimes this is good, and sometimes it is not desired.  If you are trying to shoot moving objects, the only way to do it is with a large aperture lens. The larger the aperture the better off you'll be. Just remember that you'll also have a much harder time getting pictures in focus.  If you're trying to shoot still scenes, a new lens with a much larger aperture will help a little bit, but it won't be a night and day improvement, because the lens you have now has image stabilization. If this is the case, I would strongly recommend you consider getting a tripod. With a tripod, you'll be able to take very sharp pictures of still objects even with a very slow shutter speed.  Lastly, what are you calling low light? A well lit city street? That's low light. With careful use, you can use lenses with large apertures to take nice people pictures in light like that, and you can get pretty good still pictures with a stabilized lens at a medium aperture.

By the way, due to large resolution you can get large print of the subject with Canon 77D.

But at the reachable price you can enjoy some of the best specifications in 77D, while you have to splurge little extra on 7D Mark II to consume their extraordinary features.  By the way, have a look at the major difference of these two cameras:  AF system  It will really be difficult for us to tell you which one does have superior AF system? Because you can see both the cameras are based on Dual pixel CMOS AF, which you can call a magical stick in Speed and accuracy that significantly fortifies the potential of Live View Shooting of both the camera. Actually, CMOS sensor on both 77D as well as 7D Mark II has two photodiodes per pixel (Total 40 million) and each pixel on the sensor performs both phase-difference detection autofocus and capture light. On the other hand, Phase-difference detection AF, enabling the cameras to achieve quick and easy auto focus. Furthermore, due this innovative AF system the camera gets autofocus on approx 80% of the image plane that eventually confirms you get images with stunning details.  Well, it was all about unique Dual Pixel CMOS AF, but we give more weight to 7D Mark II since the camera features 65 all cross-type AF points compared to 45 all cross-type AF points in 77D, resulting in high precision AF at remarkable speed. And when you see cross type AF points means you get stable AF, is not influenced by the subject's shape or color.  Shutter speed  One of the great advantages of faster shutter speed is that it effectively suppresses the appearance of distortion and helps you get crisp and blur free images. Moreover, it also incredibly minimizes the rolling shutter effect while shooting fast moving subjects and followed by one other great advantage that this fast shutter speed also allows the camera to capture sharp, crystal clear images with a wide open aperture while shooting at bright light conditions. So, all the things I stated above are undisputedly favoring to 7D Mark II since the camera avails faster shutter speed of 1/8000 s.

I suppose my point is, yes, do upgrade, but do it at the right time. Do it when you know you have hit the limit of your gear and you need something better. I recently saw a post on reddit where a photographer was wanting advice on upgrading from a 5Dmk3 to either a 1Dxmk2 or a 5Dsr. Apart from the fact that those are two very different cameras, there was no real justification for it, other than wanting to spend money because there is something out there that is \\u2018better'.  I think initially it's easy to fall into gear acquisition syndrome, buying lenses and cameras because of reviews online where someone has shot 100 photos against a brick wall. At some point you will know your own gear, know what you like, and know what works for you. This will only come by practice and spending time out shooting photos. I use a Canon 24\\u2013105 f4 IS L for instance. If you look online you will find that lots of people say it's not a great lens. In my case, I actually sold the objectively better 24\\u201370 2.8 to get it. The reality of carrying around a massive heavy lens for my every day shooting just didn't work. The 24\\u2013105 was much lighter, had IS for video, and if I needed to shoot in low light, I just put on one of my lightweight primes. Now if I was shooting weddings all day that might be a different matter, but I'm not. These are the sorts of things you will only find out for yourself by actually going out and taking photos."}, {"upvote": 9, "content": "The T5i has an APS-C sensor and the 5D Mk III has a full-frame sensor.  A full-frame lens will work on an APS-C sensor (the image circle is larger than the sensor); however a APS-C lens will not work on a full-frame sensor (the image circle is smaller than the sensor).  Will upgrading to a 5D Mk III improve the quality of your photos?  That depends on what is wrong with your photos.  If you understand what is wrong and a camera upgrade will fix the deficiency then yes.  If you don't understand what is wrong then upgrading the camera may do nothing for you.  Edit to include info on sharpness.  There are several reasons that your photos are not sharp:  1. There is a focus problem 2. There is subject movement and the shutter speed is too low 3. There is camera movement causing the entire photo to blur 4. The photo is being printed larger than the image capture 5. The lens is not very sharp 6. A very small aperture is being used causing diffraction to degrade the image.  A camera body upgrade can solve some of these problems.  The larger sensor supports higher ISO settings allowing faster shutter speeds perhaps solving motion blur in subject or camera movement, the advanced focus system can better track moving subjects.  Bigger sensors can also allow you to use smaller apertures on high quality lenses.  But most sharpness is gained from using a high quality lens, especially prime lenses."}, {"upvote": 24, "content": "No, not all."}, {"upvote": 12, "content": "This depends on what existing camera you have, or if you are a first time buyer, and what you intend to use the camera for. You cannot get a specific answer with a generic question. I have just bought a 6D Mark II. I have had the original 6D for nearly three years. I shoot live music in mostly small, badly lit venues. When I bought the 6D it was Canon's best low-light camera (even better than the 5D MkII and 1DX). It was also very affordable for someone who makes very little money working in a sector with very little money. It was an upgrade from a 550D (APS-C). I had one EF-S lens for that camera \\u2013 a Tamron 17\\u201350 f/2.8 that was my go to lens. My 70\\u2013200 f/2.8 was an EF. When I upgraded, I bought a used Canon 24\\u201370 f/2.8, and a friend sold me his 16\\u201335mm f/2.8 at a bargain price. I now had a full range of full-frame lenses that I needed for the 6D. That camera has now taken close 30k photos, but no video, so I was feeling the need to get a new body (as in camera, although the physical one could do with an upgrade too) when the EOS-R was announced. Personally, I'm not overly convinced about the hype over mirrorless cameras (I do have an EOS M2 as a pocket camera), probably because I have been using an SLR since the 1970s and they have never failed, and I mostly see mirrorless as a marketing ploy to sell more gear.  I looked at the same options you have asked about and asked myself if I wanted to use a body almost identical to the one I was currently familiar with, but upgraded, or go for a new technology with a new lens mount. I then looked at my bank account and prices of the two options. I found a new 6D MkII and battery grip for under \\u00a31100. It was not a difficult decision at that point. A new camera body that would use all my existing lenses without needing an adaptor, and without the need to familiarise myself with a new body and way of working, as well as using a new system in its first iteration that would need regular firmware updates. During my next upgrade cycle I may opt for the EOS-R as all the bugs will have been sorted, and my lenses will probably need upgrading as well by then.  So, as you can see, there is no definitive answer. My advice is to never buy a camera purely from the spec sheets, or people's reviews either. You need to actually hold them in your hands and use them in the situation you intend to use them most. Don't buy a camera that is over-specced for what you are shooting. For example, do you really need a full-frame camera? If you mostly want to shoot video, would an actual video camera serve you better? And always look at your budget, and don't spend more than you need to, especially if it's a hobby.  Hope all this helps."}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/unanswered/Is-EOS-EOS-cryptocurrency-a-good-investment-for-2022", "question": "unanswered/Is EOS EOS cryptocurrency a good investment for 2022", "answers": [{"upvote": 110, "content": "In order to better understand EOS future price and provide an answer to the question Is EOS a good investment?, we should first look back and see how the asset has been performing after its very successful ICO, and difficult mainnet launch.   * Before i continue, Incase you are worried about what all these cryptocurrencies might be heading to, DON'T GIVE UP!!! I almost gave up too until i came across CryptoFXnetwork Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www . cryptofxnetwork . com) where i get profit on my invested cryptocurrency after 10 trading days. Don't be left out. Be like me. I still believe in Cryptocurrency. Please Note: This is me just telling you about my personal experience so far so good about investing on the only legit cryptocurrency investment platform i have seen online, I am in no way trying to advertise or give you a financial advise on how to spend your money. You can make your research and if you find the platform deem fit then you can go ahead just like i did.  When it was first launched, the price of the EOS cryptocurrency sat at $2.29. However, it then doubled in less than 24 hours, with EOS hitting $5.40.  This hike did not last, however, and the coin soon started falling, breaking one support level after another. EOS found its bottom at $0.59, which is where it remained until late October 2017. Once the crypto bull run that marked the year reached its peak, EOS joined the rally, and it skyrocketed to $16.39 on January 13, 2018.  However, while most coins peaked around this date or earlier, EOS' all-time high came later, in April 2018. In mid-April, the crypto market \\u2013 which had been crashing since January \\u2013 started seeing a new bullish wave. Prices started going up, and many assumed that the so-called 'crypto winter' was over.  These days, we know that the surge in April was only the eye of the storm, as the crash continued as May 2018 arrived. But, for those few weeks, the EOS price jumped once more, breaking its former record, and going up to $22.89. This was the coin's highest price, and it has never reached these highs again, at least so far.  Following this second surge, EOS kept dropping, briefly stopped by support here and there, but eventually, it dropped to its new bottom at $1.86 around December 7, 2018. In 2019, the coin saw gradual growth, although it progressed slowly, and everything it had achieved by mid-2019 was undone in the second half of the year, as it slowly returned to the level where it sat ever since \\u2013 between $2 and $2.8.  The EOS price has fluctuated in this range, except for on three occasions in 2020. The first one was between mid-January and mid-February, when it joined another bull run that took it to $5.35. The second was in August 2020, when it hit $3.7, and the last one is right now, led by Bitcoin (BTC), which is once again approaching its all-time highs at $20,000.  EOS, on the other hand, is as far away from its own record as it can be, hovering around $3.26.  What is happening to EOS these days?  Unfortunately, EOS has not been making headlines in 2020, as the crypto industry is mostly focused on the decentralised finance (DeFi) sector. When DeFi started slowing down, bull runs took over, and most of the attention went to Bitcoin.  However, that does not mean that EOS has been doing nothing. Its developers at Block.one recently announced the EOS Resource Model proposal, and the soon-to-arrive review of various talented organisations that responded to the company's invitation to evaluate their code.  Block.one also recently expressed its pleasure with how Spielworks built a rewards and loyalty platform for gamers using EOSIO.  The company also worked on adding new features to its Training and Certification segment of the blockchain.  And, of course, as a development platform, EOS has also been making moves to attract people to develop new DeFi projects on its network. The network already has quite a few successful projects, although the majority of the developers are still focusing on developing DeFi on Ethereum.  EOS price prediction 2021: what to expect from EOS going forward?  Lastly, we arrive at the most interesting part \\u2014 EOS coin price prediction for 2021 and beyond.  According to TradingBeasts, the EOS price in December 2020 will reach a maximum of $3.4, after which the forecasting service expects it to drop back down to $2.7, on average.  In January 2021, its EOS crypto price prediction shows the coin remaining near this level, at around $2.7, later expecting it to experience a slow but steady rise throughout the year, with the coin having the potential to hit a high of $3.9 next December. The average price of EOS is predicted to reach $4.07 in December 2022, and then $5.03 in December 2023.  Wallet Investor also expects the currency's price to rise in early 2021, although their EOS coin forecast says that the asset will see a price crash in the second half of the year. The event will potentially lead EOS down to $1.2 one year from now.  As for CryptoGround, they have a very bullish EOS prediction. In fact, their EOS forecast claims that the coin will simply keep climbing, with its value reaching $4.17 in six months, $4.7 in one year, and $21.4 by December 2025."}, {"upvote": 215, "content": "While there are still some believers in EOS, the altcoin's future largely depends on if it can overtake ETH.

I was at your stage once, so I can totally relate to what you are saying, and I understand what you are looking for. Let me tell you a bitter truth before we jump into which lens is best. Best of the best lenses also struggle in low lit conditions; Just because you buy a lens with lower aperture won't tranform your low light photography from below average to top class. These lenses which u have mentioned will be better than your kit lens, that's for sure, but don't expect drastic difference.  Now, these two lenses serve different purpose. 50mm is a portrait lens (considering your crop-sensor body) and the other lens falls into general purpose zoom. I can't tell you which one best suits your needs because I don't know for what purpose you will be using. So, you have to decide that.  In case you just want to know what I think, since you already have 18\\u2013135, I would suggest you to go with Canon 50mm f/1.8 STM lens. If you have money, check the Sigma 30mm f/1.4 Art DC HSM lens for Canon, as well.  I hope this helps. Good luck :)  Edit: If you would like to go with 17\\u201350mm f/2.8, I think Sigma is better than Tamron. But again you will have this lens and 18\\u2013135 lens, so you'll pretty much stop using either of them. So I still recommend 50mm f/1.8 STM."}, {"upvote": 3, "content": "What makes you think a new lens will help your photography? Why are you frustrated with pictures at night and what about the new lens do you think would help you make good pictures?  If you're trying to shoot in an environment that is very low in light, using a faster lens will have the following effects:  Allowing you to shoot at ~triple the shutter speed to ~12x the shutter speed of the 18\\u2013135 kit lens. Depending on how much light you have available, it may or may not be enough to shoot handheld. The 18\\u2013135 has image stabilization, whereas there are different versions of the Tamron with and without, and the Canon 50mm f/1.4 does not have it.  Do some math. Look at the pictures you're taking. Are you trying to take pictures with a shutter speed of 1 second or longer? Or is it more like 1/15th of a second? If the former, a new lens isn't going to be very helpful in that little light. If the latter, it may.  If you are looking at lenses without image stabilization, the 18\\u2013135 IS will probably do better for still pictures in low light than the Tamron. The Canon 50mm has a much larger aperture and will probably let you shoot in lower light - but very large apertures will give you a very narrow depth of field. Sometimes this is good, and sometimes it is not desired.  If you are trying to shoot moving objects, the only way to do it is with a large aperture lens. The larger the aperture the better off you'll be. Just remember that you'll also have a much harder time getting pictures in focus.  If you're trying to shoot still scenes, a new lens with a much larger aperture will help a little bit, but it won't be a night and day improvement, because the lens you have now has image stabilization. If this is the case, I would strongly recommend you consider getting a tripod. With a tripod, you'll be able to take very sharp pictures of still objects even with a very slow shutter speed.  Lastly, what are you calling low light? A well lit city street? That's low light. With careful use, you can use lenses with large apertures to take nice people pictures in light like that, and you can get pretty good still pictures with a stabilized lens at a medium aperture.  A moonlit scene in a forest? That's tripod only territory.  Here's what you can do with a tripod:  What lens should you choose? Most likely, a tripod is the lens you should choose unless you want to stop action. If you want to stop action, then go for the 50mm f/1.4, just don't expect it to be a panacea."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "Hmm, like other is pointed out, you need to correctly identify problem first.  In low light situation, there can be following issue.  1. Camera stability. If you see tons of blur that is caused by shake, you need either tripod, IS lens to get away with slow shutter speed or wider aperture to get faster shutter speed. If you are having problem shooting night skyline or street during night, I would say tripod. 2. Image Quality at low light situation. Unfortunately, EOS 600D is not exactly a camera to shoot low light situation, it was never designed that way. And, SNR of 600D is close to that of mid range camera several generations behind. If you are frustrating with high noise rate, then you need either lighting or using tripod for better long exposure at lower ISO. Shoot RAW with good noise management post production will be also important. From design point of view, it may have 12800 ISO, but if you are going to have usable images for 8x10 print for example or publication, it will need to stay around ISO800.. is my understanding. Flash is far more practical solutions. 3. If you need to shoot say action stopping shot because of tons of motion blur, you will need external light, and if it is not a option, you can try using fast prime lens, but that has its limit, and with body limitation of EOS 600D, your option is not very good of that route. If you are shooting say candid photo in the night life scene with friends for example, 50mm can do trick, but on your 600D, it is 80mm focal length, so you will not be able to get few people in. you might want to look for 35mm lens by third party such as sigma 35mm ART.  Tamron 17-50 F2.8 can cover range, but if you do not have aid of external light, F2.8 speed won't be much as you would have hoped.  So, really important to know what you are shooting in very low light,  depend on that, you need to either give up and get external light (flash, led and so on ) or tripod since they are far more economical than getting lens with F1.2 or faster.

Do you belong to General Category?  10% EWS reservation quota is given only for the General Category candidates. Other category candidates already have reservation benefits \\u2013 OBC (27%), SC (15%), and ST (7.5%).  2. Is your family income below Rs.8 lakhs?  Persons who are not covered under the scheme of reservation for SCs, STs and OBCs and whose family has a gross annual income below Rs 8 lakh (Rupees eight lakh only) is to be identified as EWSs for benefit of reservation.  Income shall also include income from all sources i.e. salary, agriculture, business, profession, etc. for the financial year prior to the year of application.  3. Is the agricultural land owned by your family less than 5 acres?  To be classified under EWS, your family should not own or possess agricultural land of size 5 acres or above.  4. Is the residential flat owned by your family less than 1000 sq.ft?  To be classified under EWS, your family should not own or possess a residential flat of area 1000 sq.feet or more.  5. Is the residential plot owned by your family less than 100 sq.yards (in notified municipalities)?  To be classified under EWS, your family should not own or possess a residential plot of area 100 sq.yards or more in notified municipalities.

To be classified under EWS, your family should not own or possess a residential plot of area 200 sq.yards or more in areas other than in notified municipalities.  You may note that 200 sq. yards is equal to 1800 sq ft OR 4 cents (approx).  EWS Reservation Eligibility \\u2013 Is the criteria uniform across all states in India?  The above criteria are given by the Central Government.  The states in India can set their own income cut-off to decide who constitutes EWS and even exceed the income criteria set by the Centre.  The family income is considered; but what is a Family as per the EWS reservation rules?  The term Family for this purpose will include the person who seeks the benefit of reservation [ https://www.clearias.com/reservation-in-india/ ], his/her parents and siblings below the age of 18 years as also his/her spouse and children below the age of 18 years.  The property held by a Family in different locations or different places/cities would be clubbed while applying the land. or property holding test to determine EWS status.  How can you claim the benefit of EWS reservation?  EWS Reservation in UPSC CIvil Services Examination  You need to get an Income and Asset Certificate from the concerned government authority (Eg: Tehsildar).  The benefit of reservation under EWS can be availed upon production of an Income and Asset Certificate issued by a Competent Authority.  The Income and Asset Certificate issued \\u2018by any one of the following authorities in the prescribed format shall only be accepted as proof of candidate's claim as \\u2018belonging to EWS.  Authorities which can issue an \\u2018Income and Asset Certificate'   * District Magistrate/Additional District Magistrate/ Collector/ Deputy Commissioner/Additional' Deputy Commissioner/ 1st Class Stipendary Magistrate/ Sub-Divisional Magistrate/ Taluka Magistrate! Executive Magistrate/ Extra Assistant Commissioner  * Chief Presidency Magistrate/Additional Chief Presidency Magistrate/ Presidency Magistrate  * Revenue Officer not below the rank of Tehsildar  * Sub-Divisional Officer or the area where the candidate and/or his family normally resides. Regarding verification of EWS claims  The Officer who issues the certificate would do the same after carefully verifying all relevant documents following due process as prescribed by the respective State/UT.  Instructions referred to above should be strictly followed so that it may not be possible for an unscrupulous person to secure employment on the basis of a false claim and if any person gets an appointment on the basis of such false claim, her/his services shall be terminated invoking the conditions contained in the offer of appointment.  Will the candidates under EWS get additional benefits (Eg: Relaxation in age-limit, number of attempts etc)?  Though there was such a proposal initially, no such relaxations are so far allowed.  Candidates who fall under the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) will get just the 10% reservation quota. There won't be any relaxations with respect to age-limit or number of attempts.

National Service inculcates specific values into its citizen soldiers, such as loyalty to the country, building community cohesion, and creating a personal relationship among Singaporeans and soon-to-be Singaporeans of different ethnicities, religions, and socioeconomic status.

It is one cock-eyed view because about the only time the Chinese ever went overseas officially was during the Ming voyages of Admiral Zheng He in the 1400's. Even then it was doubted what was the real intent of these voyages (discovery, assertion of claim, pilgrimage or what).  Certainly during these times the seas around the Malay Archipelago (including the South China Sea) was controlled by the regional powers of the times, Sri Vijaya, Majapahit, Melaka, Ayuthya, Khmer, Champa and so on. After the Ming voyages all other expeditions were stopped. In fact during the Tang Dynasty Chinese were not allowed to travel overseas on the pain of death. So for at least 500 years they have not ventured outwards. Now all of a sudden they claim the South China Sea as their own little pond.  So the historical claim is delusional. The thing to do now is for every nation involved to collectively push the Chinese back, taking the example from Indonesia. Let's see if they would take all the nations head on.

Here are some general guidelines, since posting policy is secret. Your posting is determined by two main factors: your and your family history; and the results of your pre-enlistment check-up.  If you are an only son, it is extremely unlikely that you will be posted to the Commandos, as a fighter pilot, or anything particularly dangerous. If members of your family are politically compromised, such as having past association or sympathies with any subversive group, such the Malayan Communist Party then, or been arrested, surveilled or questioned by any intelligence service, you will not end up anywhere that gives you weapons training, or knowledge of doctrine. If members of your family, especially parents and siblings, are non-Singaporeans, and from certain non-ally nations such as China, Malaysia, Indonesia, or Yemen, for example, you will not end up anywhere that gives you weapons training, or knowledge of doctrine as well.  If your family is considered to have a strong association with any religious group, such that your allegiance to the state might be compromised, it is the same as above, exemption, or detention for the period of National Service. This is normally taken by others to mean Muslims and Islam, but it applies to the Falungong movement, for example, the Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, and certain groups of the Christian Evangelical Right. Jehovah's Witnesses are the only group detained for the duration of National Service because of their refusal to pledge allegiance to the state. Until recently, madrasah students were exempt from National Service. Now, it is extremely unlikely that a madrasah student will be anywhere but the SCDF. Until recently, Malays who qualified for Commandos ended up in Guards. Guards units have a lower security clearance. Those who converted to Islam had their security clearance downgraded. This is not necessarily permanent. The practical reason is that many converts had this bad habit of being religiously zealous, and this worries the establishment.  Your health, your PES status, determines whether you get a combat posting, not your fitness. The system can make you fit, but it cannot do anything about colour blindness, flat feet, or other inherent conditions. Having a history of depression, anxiety, or any form of neurosis, if considered chronic, will downgrade your status.  Your security clearance changes with time. It can be upgraded, or downgraded. This clearance mechanism only ends when you can no longer be possibly activated. It does not end when you ORD or ROD. Whether you have a criminal record, a prior conviction, or even a police warning prior to enlistment affects your security clearance, and your posting. Whether an immediate family member has this, may also affect you. This is not always significant. The service record of immediate family members may affect your posting.  You will have an indication of your posting based on your intake. In my time, you knew whether you were viewed as potential officer or NCO material based on your batch. In those days, all officers, whether SAF, SPF or SCDF, were recruited from BMT, before undergoing their respective OCS. If you had a skill before enlistment, the system will find a place for you.  The better your grades, the higher you will likely end up. Some of the people with the highest security clearances started out in the SAF, but were sent to MHA instead. These were postings that made us integral to the policy making process, and many signed on from there."}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/Which-would-be-a-better-option-for-beginners-a-Canon-EOS-700D-an-EOS-1300D-or-a-Nikon-D3400", "question": "Which would be a better option for beginners a Canon EOS 700D an EOS 1300D or a Nikon D3400", "answers": [{"upvote": 4, "content": "Comparison is not valid with EOS1300D being in the list.  The real competition comes between EOS 700D and Nikon D3400.  So I'll start up with similarities in both the cams.  Both have the Built-in flash feature and even the lovely viewfinders which helps to click pictures with ease, which is quite common in DSLRs. But the downpart in both the cameras is that they lack weather sealing, like the components are prone to be damaged when exposed in rain or any other uncomfortable environment. And not to forget that they also have got RAW picture support. So now the question would be coming up is that, what is RAW picture? In short adding up all the possible details, I'd say that RAW is the real picture, which is not post-processed and compressed into JPEG format. A RAW picture comparatively has more better scope in editing than the JPEG-counterpart. You can use different versions of Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom to edit your pictures in RAW format.  So now coming to the differences,  If you're the fan of tiltable displays and touchscreen, then the Canon 700D is for you because that's included in it, whereas on the counterpart the Nikon D3400 lacks. Also not to mention that with Touchscreen; the battery life of the 700D reduces to mere 440 shots. When it comes to battery-life, the Nikon D3400 tops the list with monster 1200 shots with full charge. So you can click roughly three times higher with the Nikon D3400.  So now, turning towards the focus points, A Canon 700D has 9 focus points, which is not that bad though. But when it comes to Nikon D3400, you get 11 focus points. More focus points means that the camera can auto focus over the particular object quicker. Like a Nikon D3400 can perform better in sports or wildlife photography.  Coming to the ISO, so what is ISO? ISO measures the picture's sensitivity. Means that less the ISO is there, lesser the sensor is sensitive to light, giving you grainless pictures, and when you expose the sensor to more light by Increasing the Camera's ISO, more the grains are visible. More or less, in short I'd say higher ISOs are only used when the lighting conditions are poor, and you want to click stable shots with faster shutter speeds. Apparently, a Canon 700D can reach as low as ISO 50, and Nikon can reach ISO as less as till 100. Keeping your ISO low during night long-exposure clicks gives out ultimate results. And when it comes to higher ISO the 700D can reach max 12800, whereas D3400 can reach 25600. I know there shouldn't be any case in which ISO has to be high like this. But in my opinion a crop-sensor cameras like 700D and D3400 are well known to not perform well in crazy high ISO.  Weight-factor:- A standard Nikon D3400 weighs just 395 Gm, without any lenses and a Canon 700D weighs well over 580g.  Smartphone compatibility:- Nikon seems to be quite smart enough. Instead of giving the D3400 a tiltable touch display like in Canon 700D, they've given this amazing feature, to transfer your pictures to your phone with a single touch.  Final Verdict:- In my opinion, you should opt for the Nikon D3400, as Nikon clearly beats the Canon 700D in many aspects. If you are interested in aesthetic features like the Tiltable touchscreen you can go for the Canon 700D."}, {"upvote": 4, "content": "I would say the the 1300d and the d3400 are the best current beginner DSLR cameras.

They are mostly similar but there are some specialty lenses which each brand has which is not offered by the other brand.

There are about 4 dozen cameras and lenses on the ISS, all Nikon (except for some specialty cameras, like GoPro's). Canon has failed the endurance test every time they have tried, so NASA and Russia stick with Nikon. And by the way, the Nikon's they use in space are unmodified, exactly the same equipment you buy off the shelf.  Lastly, in many cases, you can use perfectly good 20\\u201340 year old lenses on current Nikon digital cameras, with no adapters and no issues, in many cases (there are some restrictions for lower-end cameras). You cannot do this with Canon, as they have changed their lens mount 3 times, obsoleting older gear each time. This can save users a ton of money, as there is little to go wrong with older lenses, and they can generally be bought at bargain prices.

If you want Peace of mind (no magajmari) then go for SSC. 5. If you want More number of chance to appear in a year then go for Bank. 6.

Now you all are aware of the SSC CGL Post Descriptions and Preference Order along with job description & nature of work of each post. Each one of us has different priorities in life. For example, someone might want to have posting in home state or Delhi. Some might want better work environment or money. So on and so forth. Hence, define your priorities. Know, what is more important to you. And based on that order make changes to the above given preference order.  Thanks for reading!"}, {"upvote": 201, "content": "It totally depends on your definition of so called best post\\\".  Nothing is perfect in this world(in my little knowledge \\ud83d\\ude05) . There are pros and cons of each and every post from Group D to Group A. It totally depends on you, what you want from your life. You have to lose something to gain something ( in context of post selection)  Now, you have to decide what you want to gain and what you want to loss. I can only write factors which can make your choice easier.  Factors to decide the best post for you-   * Location\\u2014 Most important factor for home sick people like me. If you want to live in your homestate or its vicinity, then you may have to compromise with the salary( lower GP) if your marks are not enough to fetch you 4600 GP in your home state. This point is not applicable to those who are not home sick.  * Job profile\\u2014 2nd most important factor in my opinion. If you want a field job, or you want a relaxing desk job (i.e ready to sit on a chair whole day, whole month , whole year and for your whole life). Some jobs give you good exposure, some are of both desk and field type and some are pure desk job. So, it totally depends on your nature i.e what kind of person you are.  * Salary\\u2014 Now, if you have a clear mindset for above 2 points , then, salary become the 3rd important factor. Everyone wants earn more and more( expect a few satisfied people). So, it totally depends on you- if you can compromise with it of not {{{{{ in case you are homesick and not enough to marks to get 4600 GP in your home state;; then you have to compromise with salary, if you want your homestate}}}}}, after deciding the above 2 factors.  * Workload\\u2014 Every department has workload at some point of the year. So, the workload during rest of the year becomes key point. If you want relaxing job, then you may to compromise on other factors. So, again choice is yours.  * Power & Social Recognition - You are not there to harass someone or to showoff your power. You are there to use your so called power or authority to do something good for people of Bharat. So, if you are fan of this so called power\\\" ((which is not that much in SSC CGL posts)) , then it is also an important factor for you. Social respect is applicable to both person and post. If you will do anything wrong which is not good in eyes of people and not within the government rules , no one will respect arrogant and corrupt people like you. So, again all depends on you.  * Promotion\\u2014 Everyone wants to grow in his/her career. So, there are some posts which give you fast promotions and some have stagnation in promotions. So, again ball is in your court. So, The conclusion is \\u2014 There is nothing like best post\\\" in SSC CGL. There are pros and cons in every post. If you want X from one post, then , you will have to sacrify Y and Z. This is applicable to each and every post.   %3E In my opinion, to choose best post for you, try elimination process. Make a mindset that \\u2014 this is my top priority. Start eliminating posts according to this. In the end, you will be end up with just 2/3 posts. Then, again choose your next priority , make more elimination. You will end up choosing a post which will be best for you. How I chose Best post for me-  I expected these from a job-   * Home state or near to it (Haryana)  * Shouldn't be monotonous. Must be diverse in nature. At some point of time , the feelings like \\u2014 what I am doing here. You are not this sort of person. How you will be able to do this work for rest of your life\\\" must not come in mind.  * 4600 GP  * Good social recognition ( like no need to explain what kind of job is this.) At the end, there were only 2 posts which fulfilled the above criteria. These were  1. Excise and customs Inspector \\u2b50\\u2b50\\u2b50 2. AEO in ED I would have choosen AEO in ED if there was no random allocation and no continuous transfers. So, homelocation criteria helped me in choosing Perfect post \\ud83e\\udd70 for me \\u2014 Excise and customs Inspector \\u2b50\\u2b50\\u2b50\\ud83d\\udc9f  "}, {"upvote": 78, "content": "Your question has many dimensions and query about very specific points like profile of excise Inspector as posted in home state, cut off of excise Inspector for SSC-CGL 2019. As it is difficult to answer so specifically but in this answer i will tell you some general points about excise job and you can correlate them easily with your home state posting.  Let me answer one by one  What an Excise Inspector do - Excise Inspector are posted in CBIC department and their work is related to tax collection details, to prevent tax evasion, GST registration of new business, cases of tax evasion, to audit companies and Eway Bill checking. And they prepare weekly report about get collection, refunds and other reports related to work mentioned above for the commissionerate in which they are posted.  Over all Advantage -  1. Job Security (As you know who don't want to join government job). 2. Social Respect (You are well aware that in India Government officers are respected like God. I don't know the reason but it is very common especially in northern India). 3. Opportunity to learn about Tax System in India , As GST is a new regime, you can learn a lot and can do side business also. 4. As you have less work Load so you can prepare for other exams. 2 days leaves in a week, you can enjoy visiting differnt places. If you want to study further you have enough time. 5. If you are posted in Audit and Preventive Division, you have good chance to earn money (what you call UTM or Bribes). 6. You can learn a lot about businesses. 7. This is a uniform job. So khaki lovers can prefer this job. 8. If you wnat to work after retirement , you can get job easily in private sector, as many companies prefer to have tax consultant. If you get bored with government sector you can easily switch to private sector. This is not the case with other ssc jobs. 9. You have options of Deputation, you can go to other departments like CAG, DRI. CBI, Custom department. Disadvantages -  1. Most of the vacancies are in South India. 2. Slow promotion 3. The nature of job is clerical not exactly field job. After the introduction of GST it has become a desk job. 4. Transfer is banned in Excise Inspector post. So once you posted in a zone, you will remain through out your life. 5. Sometimes you are posted in port areas, it is difficult to leave in those cities for north indians. 6. Sometimes you may find it monotonous job. Home Posting - (I am writing the answer ashming that you are north indian).  First thing is that it is very difficult to get home Posting unless you scored exceptionally well in ssc cgl exam. There are very few vacancies in north india. But there are extra benefits of you get home state posting like -  1. You can take care of family . 2. You can do side business alsomg with job, that is difficult when you are posted in other state. 3. You can have good reputation with local leaders and officers. 4. Chances of getting bribes and UTM are high in North India. 5. All other benefits I mentioned above. Cutoff -  Here I am predicting cut- off for general category. As SSC-CGL 2019 vacancies are not released till now, so it is difficult to guess the cut off for excise post. Because cut-off for a specific post has many points like Number of Vacancies, Cut-Off of Prelims, Number of students qualified for Tier 3, Vacancies in North etc. Here I am giving you cut off for SSC-CGL 2016 & 2017 and It was 539.25 and 543.5 respectively. From these number you can get an idea about SSC-CGL 2019, and keep update related to 2018 cutoff as normalisation has been introduced in ssc cgl now, so cut off may go further high.  Thanks  I have discussed Excise Inspector job profile and zone preferences and commissionerate allocation in other answers, you can read those too."}, {"upvote": 601, "content": "It is the biggest dilemma faced by lakhs of aspirants now a days . I will give realistic and practical view of the picture taken from my personal experience.  As we already know that SSC CGL whole exam cycle upto joining takes usually 2 years on an average. On the other hand, IBPS is known for its speed and performance and certainty.  So if you are desperate for job, start banking preparation full fledged without touching any other exam. It roughly needs 4 to 6 months of dedicated preparation and you will see results pondering over. So after getting final result, start preparing for CGL and continue till the posting in Bank.  Now you have gained basic knowledge and all you need to do is solve practice sets. So this can be done with job. Now you can give CGL freely without any mental pressure of job and all. Parents will be relaxed and you can give a better shot. So till you join CGL service, you can relax in Bank Job and can learn a lot of their working. It will enhance your knowledge base.  Easy !!!!  Edit1. Thanks for awesome response. First 15k views on my answers. More power to you guyz. You Rock !!!!  Thanks for 50k views."}, {"upvote": 541, "content": "I joined this department in 2016 after resigning from a decent government job expecting some rosy picture about the job but the real picture is completely different. Let me put it this way. Inspectors r entrusted with myriad kinds of works while posted in a range like TRAN- 1 verification, mismatch between GSTR 2A, GSTR 1 and 3B, issuing letters to non filers, arrear recovery, scrutinizing pending ST 3 returns, RFD -01, miscellaneous reports etc. The working environment is flexible and easy and one can get ample amount of time left for having a balanced family life and inculcating some kinds of hobbies.  2. It is a sought after post in SSC CGL due to aura of uniform and other perquisites like there's a kind of social acceptance for the said post among our friends and relatives. But be aware that it's only limited upto that and not in the department. Inspectors are perceived to be mundane by their bosses. Whereas 70% of the work is done by inspectors and superintendents but sadly they are like unsung heros of the department. It may sound harsh but reality is that it is one of the departments where there exists a steel iron wall is drawn between bureaucrats and employees.  3. As far as the inter Commissionerate transfers are concerned, the department has put a ban on it (even spouse case is not entertained). Once one gets posted somewhere he gets a kind of punishment to live there only, almost till he becomes Group A officer. The discrimination in transfers persists as if inspectors are not human beings.  4. The promotion and career avenues for an inspector are also distressing in nature. In short one may end up being frustrated if he is posted far away from home by facing several mental and emotional pressures.  5. Keeping all the things aside, if you are clear about the priorities of life and able to fulfill the expectations bestowed on your shoulders then you are a winner."}, {"upvote": 209, "content": "i should not have responded to this question as people will think that i will give a biased view on this but lets compare facts and with due respect to my friends in Excise\\u2026.. pls dont think that i am boasting about Income Tax  first and foremost lets compare promotions . An ITI normally gets first promotion in 6\\u20137 years, In excise it takes 10\\u201312 years. and till the fag end of the career the difference only widens as generally an ITI would retire as Addl.

Similarly pay and perks will vary according to the post  The first promotion is to the cadre of ITO which is a quasi judicial authority and as per Income Tax Act there is not much difference between ITO, AC and DC except certain monetary powers enlisted in IT act, all are Assessing Officers, not so in the case of Excise .  In Income Tax, not much of a hierarchical structure like Inspector will report to ITO and he in turn will report to AC and that AC to DC and then DC to JCIT so work culture is very good but In excise hierarchy is followed like an AC will have 2\\u20133 Superintendent under him then superintendent will have 2\\u20133 inspectors under him so this creates unnecessary subordination.  Direct Tax collection for the year 2015\\u201316 has already exceeded the Indirect Tax collection for 2015\\u201316 by a considerable margin and govt. is seriously mulling to give more and more important roles and powers to IT department and therefore powers under benami transaction act, operation clean up,have been given to Income Tax Department. They are now turning into the blue eyed boys of the govt..  Post GST the power of Excise department has been further diluted and infact the IRS association of Customs and Central Excise has demanded to revoke certain provisions which have been passed by the GST council  Practically every individual who is earning is in the reach of Income Tax but Excise has limited reach only to the manufacturing unit.  HR policy of Income Tax Department is very good and i have never faced any trouble while seeking long leaves whereas my friends in Excise always complain of this issue , transfers out of station are not as frequent as in Excise.

My suggestion would be to buy and shoot a few dozen memory cards worth of images on the very inexpensive 18-55. Find its limits, where it does well and where it doesn't, what causes aberration and where it is or isn't sharp. Are you always shooting at the 55mm end of it? Pick up a used 50 f1.8 for $40ish and your image quality will improve a bit at wide aperatures. Always at the low end? Consider the 10-22 for the extra wide angle. Zoomed all the way in and can't get your subject as large as you'd like? Consider the 70-300. Starting with the 18-55 gives you a great reference on focal length for the lowest price, and is a smart choice.  If you're into landscapes where you're shooting at smaller apertures, you're probably going to find that a good tripod affects your image quality more than upgrading to the $900 17-55 f2.8 that some have suggested. We all love gear, but buy the gear that will help you the most first.  Most people don't realize how inexpensive it is to rent lenses before you try them. If you get to the point where you're ready to upgrade to a finer piece of glass, rent it first! You can rent very expensive lenses ($2000-ish range) like the 24-70 f2.8L and the 70-200 f2.8L for three days at a cost of around $60, and less expensive lenses like the 17-55 f2.8 at an even lower cost.   Good luck and happy shooting!"}, {"upvote": 2, "content": "Save a little more and get the EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS. The glass is exceptional, the constant aperture adds low-light versatility and better bokeh options, and the IS adds to the low-light versatility. You can do 1/10 second handhelds at the wide end, given a motionless subject (waterfalls, even).  The nifty fifty is cool, but the motor noise and focus searching bugged the hell out me so I replaced it with the 50mm f/1.4. The 1.8 was kind of a waste of $75. It's gathering dust somewhere in my house. I don't suppose you're near Sacramento, CA?  The EF-S 10-22mm is another exceptional EF-S mount lens. Very sharp, and the wide end gives photos something that simply stands out. It's good for candid party photos when paired with an external flash and a bounce card. Do not expect bokeh. This lens \\\"flattens\\\" images.  I'm holding off on a 70-X00 because I know I'd regret getting anything less than the EF 70-200mm f/2.8 IS II. I advise that you skip the Sigma unless the reviews are spectacular."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "Congrats on your soon-to-be purchase! The 70D is a very capable camera.  I will comment on all three lenses, then give you other suggestions.  1) Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 is a capable kit lens that delivers great quality for its price. If this is your first DSLR then you might find 18mm wide enough, but there are definitely options that go wider than 18mm, longer than 55mm or faster than f/3.5. For example, Tamron makes a superzoom that covers 16mm up to 300mm, while Sigma makes a 18-35mm lens with a f/1.8 aperture, which will couple great with the next lens.  2) Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 ii is affectionately called the Nifty Fifty. It's close to the human field of view which make it very easy to get into. Additionally, the f/1.8 will give you a lot more freedom in low light situations as it captures more light than your other options. Yongnuo makes a knockoff of this lens for a lower price and very similar quality if you are looking for the cheapest lens.  3) Sigma 70-300mm f/4-5.6 DG is a telephoto zoom. It will give you fantastic reach at a more than reasonable price. However, you will want to consider Canon's offering if budget permits.  We must acknowledge the fact that 1) and 3) are lenses that have very low resale value, which is important to know because if this is your first camera/lens purchase, chances are it might not be your ideal focal length or quality. The Canon 18-55mm is a kit lens for every Rebel camera and gets refreshed every few years. On the other hand, the Sigma 70-300mm isn't necessarily the best performing lens, and though at a retail price of $169, there are eBay listings that go as low as $75.   Alongside the resale value, 1) and 3) are both crop lenses, meaning that it will fit a Canon 70D, 60D, 7D mk ii or Rebel camera, but if you upgrade to a full frame camera at some point, you won't be able to use them.  Ultimately, I'd recommend the second lens as a starting point. After shooting for a while, ask yourself questions: Do you want a lens that's wider, longer or cover a range instead of one focal length? Do you shoot a lot of low light situation where the f/1.8 is necessary? Do you find your photographs shaky and would greatly benefit from image stabilisation (or a faster shutter speed)?"}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "Have you shot with a DSLR before? Do you know why the second lens will take better photos than the other two?   I always recommend that my students buy the 50 1.8 if they are learning manual controls for the first time. They get SO frustrated once they start to learn about aperture if they have a kit lens where the aperture shoots up to 5.6 at the long end.   When you say 'nature' - what do you mean? Wildlife? I think you'll find the 5.6 end of the zooms very frustrating when you are trying to get fast shutter speeds if you have moving wildlife in your shots.   My advice? Get the 50 1.8, learn how to use it, save up for a zoom or telephoto with 2.8 all the way along, and if that's unreasonable, look at third party lenses instead. But I really think you'll regret being limited to 5.6 at long end of the zooms."}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "If you shoot landscapes and it absolutely has to be one of those three, then get the 18-55. No question. The 70-300 is way too telephoto for most landscape shots, and although the 50mm would be the sharpest option and allow for lower light hand-held shots, it's still not as wide as you'll want, and low light performance isn't usually a top concern for nature photography.   You might also consider the EF-S 24mm f/2.8 STM, which is in the same price range as the ones you are considering. It'll be sharper and better in low light than the 18-55mm, but you may feel limited by the fixed focal length. Shooting primes can be rewarding, though.   If you can afford to spend more, Canon makes an EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS that's worth considering. Basically the same focal range as the 18-55 you are considering, but much better optics.

But as some people have pointed out. It's a misleading path.  I think it is way more important to understand why a lens is good for, say portraits, rather than just read over a long list of another person's ideal lenses. Because his list may not be ideal for you!  To choose a lens you first need to decide what you will be doing with it. Why? Because each type of photography will have a few sweet spot lenses. Not understanding what to look for means you may get a lens that does not suit your typical photos.  I tend to categorise as:   * portraits  * landscape  * nature  * sports Let's say you choose portrait work. In this case I would always go for a prime lens. hands down   * Prime lenses are sharper because they have less moving parts: less glass basically. Zoom lenses sacrifice sharpness to give you optical zoom. But with a portrait you don't need that - just take a step closer to the model!  * You also need a lens that opens up to at least F1.8 . This will give you the narrow depth of field that many stunning portraits require. If you can afford 1.4 then go for it. The aperture is where the money goes on these lenses because aperture is vital for portraits. Again, zoom lenses are more complex in their build and so tend to only open to f3 or f4. Not great for portrait. 2-0 to primes so far.  * Next is focal length. You can take good portraits across a range of focal lengths. A zoom will cover these ranges in one lens. So 2\\u20131. The reality is that anything under 50mm will distort the models face. Anything above 85 will mean you need to be so far away you might struggle for space. So a prime 50 or a prime 85 is fine. This way you don't compromise on the above. I personally use a 50mm 1.8 for many of my photos. It is cheap and reliable. You can pick up a prime lens like this $150 USD. With a price like that you can then look a zoom lens for your landscape work!  I buy most of my lenses second hand. It means i can buy more lenses. There is very little risk with a lens. Once you inspect it you can see if there are any problems.  Let me just say something about brands here. Canon lenses are expensive. Other manufacturers can be just as good. I've had a good Tamron lens. Once you decide on the aperture and focal length you want. Look for well reviewed lenses. You do not need to buy a Canon lens. If you decide you want to spend the extra cash for them they are good and reliable. So it is not a bad choice.  Below are two recent portraits I took with the Canon 50 mm lens. You can see how important being able to use a wide open 1 .8 aperture helps focus your gaze on parts of the photo and give them depth. A stock zoom lens you may get with a camera would not likely open up much past f4 and would not give you this.  If you decide you want to look at landscape photos you will need to consider a lens on different merits.  Hope this helps."}, {"upvote": 25, "content": "The term best depends on your requirement.

Interface is a personal preference. Learn both and decide for yourself. They are conceptually different and while switching between them isn't that hard, they do require some adaptation.  Nikon's flash system has a slight edge.  Canon's service is significantly better on average.  Canon's AF is generally regarded as superior, but Nikon has some matchups that are extremely favorable today due to excessive arbitrary segmentation by Canon.  People that focus too much on dxomark tend to miss out on other advantages, and may be under the impression that Nikon's lenses are superior to Canon's - truth is, some are, some aren't, but when you're comparing the resolution you get from a 36MP sensor to a 22MP sensor, the measurements aren't going to be in favor of the lower resolution. The upcoming 5DS will demonstrate that. Note: the 5DS R came out, DXO tested, and now Canon mount lenses are at the top of the sharpness metric.  It costs money to switch brands. Nikon has some edges now, and they may lose them in the future. But in the end, you can make fantastic images with either.

Like how a writer uses a pen, a chef uses a knife, a barber uses his scissors, a soldier uses his guns, a photographer uses cameras. It's a tool to capture pictures. Period. Now, how the pictures come out, entirely depend on how the camera has been put to use.  Since you said you are a beginner, get this point straight right at this point because I made this mistake and ended up spending a lot of money and I don't want to see another brother, (or a sister) suffer.  Cameras do only 30% of the work when it comes to taking pictures. The bigger half of the work is done by lenses you use.  For example, I took this picture with the 18-55mm kit lens that I got with my nikon d3300.  Not so great, right? Ok, now I swap my 18-55mm to a 50mm prime.  See the difference? The camera used for both pictures is same but the output has a huge difference just because I swapped the lens.  Nikon, canon, sony are all good. The reason why they are the top brands is because while one company launches a new product, the other is already on it's way doing R&D to make something even better. If Nikon made it big last year, canon is not going to remain quite this year.  So, choose which ever camera you want. Look up dpreview.com to compare cameras side by side. You can choose one camera over the other based on resolution, number of focus points, etc, etc, but remember that it is you who will make the camera take the pictures.  Keep shooting, go for the manual mode as early as possible. You will not get good shots to being with, but that should never stop you from taking pictures. Shoot as much as you like, shoot whatever you like. Keep the passion alive and before you know it, you will go from a hobbyist to aficionado. The rest, will fall in place eventually.

Canon slightly better with video than Nikon, while Nikon's flash system is clearly superior to Canon's.  Canon gear gets more media exposure-you see them more, because of the light grey lens. Back when they put fluorite elements into their lenses, they had problems with them if they got hot, so they painted their lenses a light grey to reflect more heat. Best PR move ever. Their big lenses probably focus a touch faster as well, so sports people lean Canon. The newest Nikon lenses focus just as fast as the Canon lenses, however.  If you watch the shows like CSI, you will notice they always use Nikon. For a reason: Pro shooters who do close-up work almost always use Nikon. Nikon makes more than twice as many different types of macro lenses as does Canon.  But there is one place where you will only find Nikon. In space. NASA only uses Nikon cameras. There are about 4 dozen cameras and lenses on the ISS, all Nikon (except for some specialty cameras, like GoPro's). Canon has failed the endurance test every time they have tried, so NASA and Russia stick with Nikon. And by the way, the Nikon's they use in space are unmodified, exactly the same equipment you buy off the shelf.  Lastly, in many cases, you can use perfectly good 20\\u201340 year old lenses on current Nikon digital cameras, with no adapters and no issues, in many cases (there are some restrictions for lower-end cameras). You cannot do this with Canon, as they have changed their lens mount 3 times, obsoleting older gear each time. This can save users a ton of money, as there is little to go wrong with older lenses, and they can generally be bought at bargain prices.

However, more importantly, their technology in development is competitive with the best blockchains out there right now while Bitcoin's technology is 1,000x times behind in almost every way, security, scalability, decentralizatoin. This is no exaggeration. 3. XRP XRP is vastly overvalued. They only have a few banks that are doing some beta testing. Their technology isn't all bad. In fact, they are probably among the top 5 most decentralized blockchains [ https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-decentralized-cryptocurrency ], but that's it.   A $1B market cap would maybe be justified for XRP right now, but definitely not a $17B. 4. BCH BCH definitely doesn't deserve to be there.

LTC LTC also doesn't deserve to be there, because they offer zero innovation and their founder isn't even working on it anymore. 6. EOS EOS definitely doesn't deserve to be on there. It is one of the most centralized  [ https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-decentralized-cryptocurrency/answer/Marius-Kramer ]and the buggiest, security-flawed blockchains of all. 7.

Surprisingly, we start with:  Bitcoin BTC (100% deserved) has the largest market cap with good reason. The project has build a lot of trust. There is no single big organization behind it, that could steer the project into a spiral of bad decisions. One can say, Bitcoin is applying the principle If it works, don't touch it and in fact, very successfully. There is no dumping of tokens/organization wallet \\u2014 yes, there are whales, that can manipulate the price, but so does every asset or currency. By construction, Bitcoin is immune to inflation, which could make it a great tool for storing and protecting value, especially when fiat currency is being devalued. Biggest enemy of Bitcoin are banks and government opposition. Bitcoin is awful for conducting transactions. There is not transaction finality and fees are very high. I believe there is space in the top 10 for the project that has a decentralized ability to transact with almost instant transaction finality and zero or close to zero fees.  Ethereum ETH (100% deserved 2nd place) is the platform, on which many, if not most of the projects in the top 100 are running. It also has the first mover advantage, same as Bitcoin. The team behind it, also has shown reliability and is working on very ambitious goals \\u2014 scalability, leaving PoW, reliable oracles (bringing off-chain information on-chain). With great power comes great responsibility \\u2014 having such a big ecosystem makes innovation harder and can be restrictive towards how much change can be done on Ethereum. Also if anyone knocks ETH off of the 2nd place, I believe it would be due to very high growth in another project and not due to drop in ETH.  Litecoin LTC (90% deserved) the project is essentially Bitcoin with some tweaks. It has lower HASH RATE than Bitcoin, but still enough in order to be considered secure. It has lower fees and faster transaction finality. Still only better than Bitcoin by a constant. This is not good enough, but I can see Litecoin as a solid project and the reasons are the same as with Bitcoin: decentralization, immunity to inflation.  Binance Coin BNB (85% deserved, but risky) is the best exchange as of today. This can change in an instant, but their security standards seem high, so this is unlikely to happen. The US ban on Binance will probably have lesser affect on price, than people think \\u2014 the US is not the whole world. Also there are ways to avoid the ban \\u2014 buying a VPN that does not keep logs at a reasonable price. Combined with PET like IP-Sec, Onion Routing, Rendezvous Nodes. For the typical user, Binance will most likely open a separate, regulated exchange.  Tether USDT (100% deserved) This project is famous for lying about how its currency is backed. This is a stable coin (1 USDT = 1 USD), but we are not entirely sure how its backed. It's shady, but has worked so far. We need a stable coin (for now :)) Some claim that it is 74% backed by real USD and this is more reserve and backing than many banks operate on. So probably, this is as good as it gets for a stable coin. USDT is used by many, when they feel bearish about a project, or as an intermediary. The high market cap is purely due to high quantity and high transaction volumes.  Ripple's XRP (30% deserved, 0% 3rd place) is a tricky project. I am not a bank, and I do not understand the benefits of this decentralized project completely. People keep saying that banks could use it for moving assets, but somehow I doubt that. Ripple controls every XRP node, they get to choose who has a node and who hasn't. Question to think about: If you had (or actually have) and XRP wallet, can Ripple lock you out/steal everything completely? Also Ripple still has more than 50% of the supply, they can dump it any time, or as often as they want.  I am not entirely sure about Cardano and EOS. Of the two, Cardano is an okay project, EOS is a bad one. Oversimplified, but in the end do your own decisions and research!  I see absolutely nothing in BCH and BSV. No strong team behind it, high manipulation, no innovation. Look at the code changes in GitHub\\u2026next to none/dead ends/merging old PRs.  Also, you can see from the Star, which projects are included in my Favourites and which are not :)  This is my personal view and I welcome anyone with different one. I think we will see shifts in the top 10, as soon as good new projects gain traction and Alt-Season is a reality. A more drastic shift in the top 10 would be really interesting, but for it to happen, BTC must increase in value and then release some of its dominance for an Alt-Season.

Before I get in to my opinion about these coins/tokens, if you're investing in cryptocurrencies do your own research. I constantly see so called experts on crypto who have thousands of followers and they constantly contradict themselves. One minute they're saying project A is a scam, but then turn around and praise project B that's also scam. Hidden agenda? It's likely, but if you don't do your own research you'll never see that and possibly lose money in the long run following these individual's advice. I'm not going to get into the whole centralization vs decentralization subject, because at the end of the day they're all centralized to a certain extent (Especially if a small amount of addresses hold the majority of the coins/tokens). Ok now that that's out of the way lets get started.  1. Bitcoin (BTC)- At the moment how can anyone say it doesn't deserve to be in the top 10. It gave birth to the market and the viability for blockchain technology to be used worldwide. The ATH at the end of 2017 also gave the space a ton of publicity globally to bring in new investors. Out of the 2000+ cryptocurrencies Bitcoin's still most likely the only one an individual outside of crypto would know anything about and the first they would invest in if they decided to enter the market. Will it be in the top ten in the future probably not in my opinion, but for now it should be. 2. Ethereum (ETH)- Ethereum definitely should be in the top ten. ETH started the smart contract and dapp era in blockchain and fueled the ICO, or majority scam, craze in late 2017. There have been some pretty good projects built on the platform with several of then moving to their own mainnet (Tron, EOS, and Zilliqa are a few that started out with Ethereum). 3. XRP- XRP should be in the top 10. XRP has done a lot to help bring good exposure to the market as well. Besides having the best use case in the top 10 at the moment, cross border payments, it's in a multitrillion dollar industry. If XRP can take a large portion of Swift's daily transaction volume it has a lot of room to grow moving forward. Read this article for more on SWIFT %3ESWIFT Gains In Average Daily Message Volume | PYMNTS.com [ https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/financial-messaging-cross-border-transactions/ ] 4. Bitcoin Cash (BCH)- Bitcoin Cash also deserves to be in the top 10 at the moment. It's the most successful of the Bitcoin forks and it is putting out 24 HR volumes over 1 billion dollars on a daily basis. A nice upgrade to Bitcoin and the fork came at the most opportune time to help it gain traction. 5. Litecoin (LTC)- Litecoin makes the cut (5 for 5 we're on a roll) and I really think its a steal at the current price, even with the daily transaction numbers down over the last several months. LTC is a great coin to use for payments globally. When I first got into crypto Litecoin was my coin of choice just because it was easy to use and the transactions were fast and cheap. It has a pretty good partnership with the UFC to help with it's adoption. 6. EOS- Unfortunately the streak ends here, EOS could potentially be (with high tps and good scalability), but at the moment I do not believe it should be in the top 10. Along with not having very good dapps, the majority of the dapp activity on the platform is fake. Read more about EOS dapp activity here%3E Study: 75% of EOS Dapp Transactions Are Now Made By Bots - CoinDesk [ https://www.coindesk.com/study-75-of-dapp-transactions-are-now-made-by-bots ] 7. Binance Coin (BNB)- Although Binance is the top exchange a lot of their 24 HR volume is fake in my opinion. I have read several articles claiming that Binance, Bitfinex, and Liquid are the only exchanges that do not fake volumes, but if that's the case why was Binance's BNB coin found to have almost 50% fake 24 HR volume?

Those fake volumes have lured in thousands if not millions to the platform so off of revenue alone I'd have to say they should be in the top 10, but they don't deserve to be. 8. Bitcoin (BSV )- BSV is another no go for me. Anything with Bitcoin in its name other than Bitcoin Cash is a wash to me (Bitcoin Gold, Silver, Private, etc). Where can it be used? On top of that the whole Craig Wright saga just screams scam to me. Read more here %3ESelf-proclaimed Bitcoin creator Craig Wright committed fraud according to Florida court documents [ https://cryptoslate.com/craig-wright-committed-fraud/ ] 9. USDT (Tether)- Just off of how much money is moved in and out of tether I think it deserves to be in the top 10. Is Tether actually backed dollar for dollar is another story. 10. Stellar (XLM)- XLM should not be in the top 10 and I personally don't believe it should be in the top 20 at this point. I've been following Stellar since the summer of 2017 and they haven't really done anything major in 2 years. The only thing that stands out to me about Stellar is their partnership with IBM. Other than that the marketing and development for the project is terrible. At the moment I would replace EOS with Tron (TRX), Bitcoin SV with DASH, and Stellar with IOTA."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "The only use of blockchain that makes sense is for creating censorship resistant unconfiscatable store of value - i.e. Bitcoin.  All the rest uses are imaginary. They can't work, don't work and will never work.  Let's take smart contracts - those were renamed to dApps as smart contract cannot be decentralized, smart and a contract at the same time. you can have any two but not all three at the same time. Hence dApp - a decentralized program but not a contract anymore. Why not a contract? Because any program in order to be developed should be mutable, while contracts should be immutable. However, if the program is mutable and there's someone with control over how the program modified, then it is also not really decentralized. Anyway, there are also not that many apps that just have to be decentralized to achieve censorship resistance while justifying the costs of decentralization. The only use we discovered so far - is digital Store of Value, and it is economically justified only because it is impossible to create a centralized apolitical Store of Value as the governments will be there ready to destroy it as such Store of Value will compete with government printed fiat money and thus make it hard for governments to redistribute wealth from the poor to the rich by the means of inflation.  Moreover, the main issue with running centralized but censorship resistant app is with monetization. You can't get donations/sell services in fiat. All the rest is not an issue - look at WeikiLeaks. They take donations in Bitcoin and run their own server on the internet. Running an app on dark web is easy, monetizing it hard. So, all you need is Bitcoin to enable centralized censorship resistant apps. Which means not only Ethereum doesn't really work, there's only no need for it to work to actually achieve vision of unstoppable apps.

The Canon EOS 80D is a refinement of the popular enthusiast Canon EOS 70D. While the body largely remains unchanged compared to its predecessor, the 80D has received a new imaging sensor, a new metering sensor and a revamped AF system. It also adds the ability to use continuous autofocus during live view stills shooting thank to on-sensor Dual Pixel AF.  The 80D has a new phase-detection autofocus system that includes 45 cross-type AF points. When shooting through the viewfinder using a single point or cluster of points the 80D's autofocus is generally reliable. Its center AF point is even more sensitive than the rest of the points, which translates to an ability to focus in very low light scenarios.  The 80D offers subject tracking when shooting through the viewfinder, via its 45-point auto select mode. However the system is easily is confused in many shooting scenarios. And by default the 80D attempts to automatically identify a subject to track, which it does poorly. Fortunately, this can be switched to a manual selection from within the menus.  The 80D also offers the best dynamic range of any APS-C Canon sensor to date, substantially better than its predecessor or the 7D Mark II. And its live view implementation is one of the best of any DSLR to date, thanks to its articulating touchscreen and intuitive touch interface. And while the 80D's 45-point AF system is not as advanced of that of its big brother, the 7D Mark II, it's not half bad. The 80D offers one of the most robust live view implementations of any DSLR to date. Continuous AF during still shooting is still a relatively new DSLR feature, I first saw it offered in the Canon EOS 760D and now the 80D. And while the live view AF modes are borrowed from the Powershot compact line, the overall experience is decent. The Face+Tracking mode in particular is useful for photographing friends and family.  For those looking to dabble in video, there is a lot to like in the 80D, but also some drawback. Tasks like pulling focus on the 80D are as simple at tapping the screen. And sliders allow for focus speed to be adjusted to one's liking. The inclusion of both a microphone and headphone port also add to the 80D's video appeal. But the lack of any flat picture profile, zebra stripes or clean HDMI out may be a deal breaker for some. Also, no 4K.  It is very easy to shoot decent-looking video with the 80D. The camera's Dual Pixel AF results in very accurate continuous focus and tracking during video capture. In fact, the 80D offers some of the best autofocus during video capture of any DSLR around. The camera's built-in stereo microphone has been moved closer to the front of the body for better overall quality and a headphone port has been added to complement the microphone input. Video quality has been slightly improved over its predecessor, and looks better than the Nikon D7200.  Introducing the Canon EOS 80D Camera [ https://youtu.be/Fj2O7ZUS_Xk ]  The 80D's articulating touchscreen display is especially handy when used in conjunction with the Quick menu to rapidly access core functions. And touch to focus/touch to shoot capabilities are useful for street photography and candids. And is even more useful during video capture.  The 80D's sensor sees a minor bump in resolution and, straight out of the camera, image quality is roughly the same as its predecessor in both both Raw and JPEG modes. Raw dynamic range on the other hand is increased substantially, and if you're prepared to spend some time manipulating the 80D's Raw files, the extra latitude can make a huge difference to the camera's photographic potential in some shooting situations. The 80D's sensor still lags behind the competition a little bit in this regard (specifically against the Nikon D7200 and Sony a6300) but it's encouraging to see Canon finally moving forward in terms of dynamic range.  As an upgrade from the 70D, there's a lot to like about the 80D, but possibly not enough to warrant trading up, unless you're interested in video. However if you're considering upgrading from a Rebel camera, the 80D is an excellent and natural progression in Canon's DSLR family. And if you're considering the 80D against the 7D Mark II, the choice is less clear and mostly boils down to what you value more, a better AF system and AF ergonomics (in the 7D Mark II), or better dynamic range, an articulating touchscreen, and that impressive Dual Pixel AF system.  A very well-rounded camera, the 80D's main appeal centers around ease-of-use. It is well-constructed, offers ample control points, and an easy-to-use design. For serious sports or action photography, there are others cameras in this class with better AF performance that I'd recommend over the 80D. The same goes for serious filmmakers. Overall though, the 80D is a great choice for enthusiasts seeking a still/video hybrid camera for documenting everyday life, like time spent with friends and family."}, {"upvote": 2, "content": "It's the most current crop frame DSLR from Canon.

Many of the YouTube reviewer is singing on the top specs products, and encourage all viewer purchase from their link, and this is how reviewer make money!  For people who never tried high-end Canon or Nikon product, they will never know how's the quality can be. It's tough to describe on paper or even by telling you face to face. One have to buy it and experience it by themselves, and they will see the different.  I got an Canon 1D mark IV DSLR that produced in 2007, the high ISO image (up to 12,800) is even on par with my 2012 Canon 6D! APSH sensor on 2007 is on par with 2012 full frame, are you kidding? Yes, I'm serious, at least to my eyes.  Not to mention the camera auto focus system, it's blazing fast, consistent and reliable.  All above are based my limited personal experiences, no offence to any others camera brand.  Once again, if you want a practical camera that capable to caption good 1080p video, got for it.

Before you downvote, please read the whole answer.   When you buy a car, you go to the dealer with an idea of what car you want, you test drive it, and if you like it you buy it, right? You can do the same thing with lenses.  You listed a great variety of subject matter and focal lengths, from close up macro work to long lens action photography, and there are no \\\"magic bullet\\\" lenses that will do them all superbly. You're going to find after about 30,000 pictures that some of those subjects you enjoy, and some of them you don't. Dropping 2 grand on a 70-200 f2.8 IS ii is foolish if you only use it twice a year because you don't really enjoy shooting sports or your studio area is too small to use it. The same with spending $500 on a macro lens for food photography - if you aren't regularly getting paid to do it, why spend the money when your 18-55 probably will suffice, at least while you're learning? The money you save can go into things that improve the photography you enjoy- strobes for fashion, monopods for sports etc.   When I first started taking pictures, I loved taking landscapes and doing bird photography. I was looking at 400 f2.8s and wide angle lenses, and then after 3 months... I never wanted to see another bird or sunset in my viewfinder ever again. My interest shifted to portraits of my children, and I thought maybe I'd enjoy carving my niche in child portraiture. Know what I found? I hate working with other people's bratty kids.   Finally I realized that what I really enjoyed was action journalism. Freezing fast, fleeting moments in time that will never be repeated. For six months I shot and shot all the action I could, and never tired of it. Concerts. Sports. Motor sports. Outdoor action. Live performance. I finally found what I truly enjoyed and bought the gear that was right for me: A 24-70 f2.8 and a 70-200 f2.8. A 300 f2.8 will probably be added if I feel I can make enough money with it this fall. Two years later, I haven't had a single regret about the gear I purchased.  Had I not gone through that discovery, I would have probably spent $8-9000 on lenses that didn't fit my needs and had a zero percent chance of paying back my investment in them. What if you buy a 24-70, but discover that you wish it were just a little wider? In that case the 17-55 would have been a better place to put your money and might have saved you from buying a 16-35 to only cover the 16-23mm focal lengths.   So how did I do all of this discovery without buying the lenses? I rented them. For much less than the price of the lenses, I spent a couple weeks with the best ultra-wide, standard zoom, tele and super tele lenses when I needed them. My shiny new multi hundred or thousand dollar investment never sat on the shelf unused. After renting (and sometimes not renting but wishing I had) I was able to figure out what gear worked for me.   The key to discovery is to do it as cheaply as possible. Find what you enjoy shooting first, because once the novelty of taking pictures with your new camera wears off, you're going to find that there's some things on that list that you love to shoot, and some that you just can't stand to!"}, {"upvote": 2, "content": "Top lenses for novice shooters who has an entry level body.

I personally love the Zeiss Makro Planar 2/100, but you can go with a Canon offering like the 100mm f/2.8 macro (L or non-L series is fine).  Landscape: EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 or the newer and cheaper EF-S 10-18mm f/4.5-5.6. You'll want the EF-S versions for the wider angle of view compensation for the 1.6x crop factor. The L series 16-35mm won't go wide enough as the specially crop sensor designed EF-S versions.  Portrait: You'll want to go with a fast prime. You can go as cheap as a 50mm f/1.8 II (the nifty fifty, $100) to a high end EF 85mm f/1.2L II (the \\\"magic Canonball\\\", $2100). This will depend on your budget, but both lenses will give you fantastic portrait shots. A nice in-between choice is the 135mm f/2L which gives nice, tight, portraits and is quite affordable (around $1000). For the ultimate luxury, the Zeiss Otus 55mm f/1.4 or 85mm f/1.4 gives unparalleled image quality ($4000\\u2013$4500).  Sports: I'd go with a traditional FF lens like the 70-200mm f/2.8. Nice zoom range, fast aperture, and reliable autofocus. The non-L series telephoto zoom lenses are iffy.  Lifestyle and event photography: EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8. Lightweight, compact, large f/2.8 aperture. Often compared to it's bigger FF sensor big brother, the 24-70mm f/2.8L. The Sigma 18-35mm f/1.8 is even faster and I heard gives the Canon lenses a serious run for the money.

I like all of these lenses, and they each have their strengths, but I could have saved money by getting one really good lens to cover a variety of focal lengths. When the Canon 18-135 STM lens came out, I bought one and have used it almost exclusively since I got it. It's a great lens for a wide variety of scenarios, and for a novice, it's not overly expensive, and will give you a lot of usability until you decide you want to get into something more expensive (if you feel you want to.) Don't let anyone tell you that you should be moving up to a full-frame. There's honestly no compelling reason to do so unless you are going to make photography your business, or you just want to spend a lot more money.

I'm taking this from the perspective of someone who wants to get some decent glass for an APS-C format camera and understands there are no magic bullets.

It's only a 2x zoom range, but it's right in the sweet spot of the 'lifestyle' and 'event' shooting you describe.    For sports shooting, I'd suggest spending the money and getting the 70-200/2.8.  It's a huge splurge, but its the only way to avoid being light starved in indoor arenas or at dusk.  The only thing more expensive than this lens is not buying it right away. You'll get here eventually, it's a just a matter of how many lenses you buy before you realize that light gathering and AF are the sine qua none of sports shooting.  This two lens combo leaves gaps at the wide end and in the 'portrait' length.  Both of these are a bit more specialized.  For the portrait length you might look at the canon 50/1.4 or Sigma Art 50/1.4.  These are large enough aperture to do a good job with portraits.  On the wide end, I'd wait until you have a firmer grip on your actual needs. A wide zoom, like the 10-22 Canon, is nice.

Lifestyle and event - like the other poster said, a lot of photojournalist types use these two lenses.  Do you have a budget in mind?  If you are just starting out, you can get a lot done with the 18-55 and 55-250 combo.  These aren't the BEST lenses but they have good range, and are pretty sharp.

Do not get this line of thinking stuck in your head because it's not entirely true. In fact, to be honest, this statement is used many times by people who simply can't afford good gear and are jealous at those who can. If you can't afford good gear right now, that's fine; work with what you can afford and save up money to grow into better gear over time. The best camera is always the one you have with you and by this I mean, if you own a $6,500 Canon 1DX and it's sitting at home, your best camera may be the free one that came built into the phone in your pocket!  While it is true, skill is the most important aspect of almost anything, including photography, your gear and even more specifically, your lenses, are just as important. A good lens on an inexpensive camera is always better than a cheap lens on an expensive camera. If you're just starting out and looking for a camera for a beginner, try to think about what sort of photography you'll be doing. General photography such as family photos, photos of your friends, pets, etc.; landscape photography; wildlife photography; street photography, etc. If you don't know yet, that's okay but if you have a goal of developing skills specific to one of these styles, it will help with camera selection.  When getting started, I'd get something inexpensive but not so cheap that your photo quality ends up discouraging you altogether (again, this is where the \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" nonsense kicks in.) I'll cover a couple types and why they're good starter cameras. And with any camera you choose, always try to keep the camera out of \\\"automatic mode\\\" if possible so you begin to master the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  Point-and-Shoot or Camera Phone  These cameras are very inexpensive and with the newer smartphones, the camera is built right in and often takes better photos than the DSLR's from just a few years ago! This is the most inexpensive route to take (and may not cost a penny if you use the camera on your phone) and it helps you learn about composition, lighting, etc. If you're already past this point and want a camera you can grow into, the following are good options:  Traditional SLR's  I know, this is probably not what most people think of when deciding on a beginner's camera but I want to mention it because if you have one of these lying around in your house (parent's or grandparent's old camera, etc.), they're great for learning the basics of a camera with all of the digital stuff removed. SLR (single lens reflex) cameras aren't used much anymore because of the cost of operation, decreased photo quality, and lack of film processing labs, however, I think any aspiring photographer should own or at least use one because they are the \\\"original camera\\\", they are inexpensive, and they help give you a greater appreciation for the luxury of digital photography (not limited to 24-36 photos per roll, immediate results where you can see your photo seconds after taking it, easy and fast multiple frame shooting, and no cost by ruining a roll of film or wasting it on bad photos.) If you buy a traditional SLR 35mm camera, I'd go for something like the Nikon 35mm F2AS with a 50mm \\\"prime lens\\\", or similar. Here's a photo of one of mine:  Digital SLR's  Digital SLR's, or DSLR's, have been the most popular choice for many years now, they're easy to find used, and they're a good starting point in learning photography. These cameras are basically digital versions of the original SLR camera but offer much more flexibility and many more options. Whagt we're seeing right now, however, is a switch from DSLR's to \\\"mirrorless cameras\\\", including the very popular \\\"Micro Four Thirds\\\" cameras which use a smaller sensor, yet often outperform the DSLR's. I'll touch on those, below. Anyway, an inexpensive or used DSLR is a good choice for starting out and I'd recommend an entry level Canon DSLR such as one of the \\\"Rebel\\\" series cameras. I currently use a Canon 1DX which is NOT a beginner's camera, and my old Canon 5D Mark II (this is a great beginner's camera, easy to find, and inexpensive.) Here's a photo of the Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm prime lens attached:  Mirrorless Cameras  These cameras really are \\\"the future of photography\\\" although many professional photographers would scoff at you for even suggesting such a thing because just as it was when SLR's were phasing out, DSLR using pro's often get stuck in their ways and refuse to move with the times. Even today there are professional photographers who refuse to switch from SLR to DSLR! Mirrorless cameras are superior to DSLR's in almost every way: They have higher resolution (megapixels) for a fraction of the cost of DSLR's; there's no mirror flapping around making noise and causing camera vibration; they're smaller and easier to carry, many can shoot 4K and even Cinema 4K video (while Canon and Nikon refuse to adapt and offer this feature for a reasonable price in their DSLR's); and overall, they're less expensive. If you can afford one (they're often cheaper than many new DSLR's), go for it! I currently shoot with a Panasonic Lumix GH4 because I shoot photography AND I need to shoot 4K video and this camera does both. An even less expensive alternative is the Lumix GH3 which sells for around $500, a quarter of the price of the GH4. Here's a photo of the Lumix GH4, a \\\"mirrorless camera\\\":  Regardless of what you choose, unless it's a cheap $30 point-and-shoot or your phone's camera, try to make a decision on which camera format you want to grow into, otherwise you'll be wasting money on a camera and the expensive lenses that you'll end up not using when you switch to a different format.  Taking an introductory photography class or workshop is also a good idea when getting started as you'll more quickly learn the basics including aperture, exposure, shutter speed, composition, and editing. Good luck with your search and your journey into photography!"}, {"upvote": 37, "content": "I'm an enthusiast photographer that don't make money from my photo, but I'm involved in unpaid serious photo projects very frequently, and most of the result from those projects are being published/printed. But even so, I don't consider myself to be a professional.  To me, the word professional is very ambiguous. The real meaning of the word \\\"professional\\\" is that you are making a living out of your photography, so in this case the camera must be able to produce photos with image quality that surpass the minimum photo-publishing requirements. In this case, a 700D with its 18MP Canon sensor that's also being used in the 7D meets the requirement, as the image quality produced by the 700D will satisfy at the very least the minimum standard requirement of many photographers; so it's safe to say it's good enough to be considered a \\\"professional camera\\\". A lot of low-budget studios where I live, which I consider to be professional photography studio, even still use the good-old 500D for passport headshots and similar stuffs, and they make money from it; that makes the 500D a \\\"professional camera\\\". I'm pretty sure that the photos from the 700D are also good enough to even get pass the very strict requirement of a lot of professional stock photography agencies. So there's that one kind of professional.    On the other hand, the assumed meaning of the word \\\"professional camera\\\" that the camera manufacturers and marketing departments tried to emphasize to us is the camera with the most feature packed with a very high price-level. Well, in this case, the 700D is not a professional camera, and the manufacturer will push you towards a 7D, 5D or 1D, in hope that you'll buy those products with a much higher margin to both cover the operational cost of the manufacturer and make more profit for the company. They don't care if you make a living out of your camera or not, but the 7D, 6D, 5D, and 1D are professional cameras. That's another kind of professional.  Now let's discuss the 700D specifically. I don't personally own the 700D but I used to own a 650D for one year, and it's spec'ed very similar to the 700D. The 650D/700D can shoot 18MP RAW or JPEG with a CMOS sensor that's very similar to the sensor on the high-end Canon 7D. It does shoot at 4 or 5fps burst image, it shoot 30fps video at 1080p, it has a decent viewfinder, and a good all-around control as well as menu.   Upgrading from a 650D/700D to a 7D, a \\\"professional\\\" camera, will give you faster burst image at 8fps, weather-sealing, better view-finder, more extensive manual control, and a heavier body. But it will not give you a better image quality.   Upgrading to a 5D Mark III will give you a somewhat cleaner image quality at high ISO, better control, better viewfinder, weather-sealing, better video output, but you're back with 5fps burst speed, and you'll have to invest to full-frame lenses.   Upgrading to 1D, you'll get 7D fast-performance with an almost-5D-like image quality, but it'll cost you as much as a used decent car.  Now the important question that you'll have to ask for yourself is: will you make more money if you have a 7D, 6D, 5D, or a 1D? Maybe yes, maybe no. But one thing for sure, you'll have to spend more money to buy those cameras than if you buy the 700D. Can you justify that? Do you really need to have those features on those so-called professional cameras, or can you live with just the features on the 700D?  I personally don't give too much thought about using the so-called professional cameras. As long as I can deliver the results needed by the clients or by yourself, I think I'm happy. My 650D could deliver the result that I require back then, and to my book, it's good enough. I don't know about you, nor do I know about your photography requirement, so I can't speak for you.  To conclude, I quoted a small part of David Thorpe's blog post with the title \\\"Is This Camera Professional\\\". David Thorpe is an ex-photojournalist from UK, a true professional photographer in my opinion. Here's that quote:   %3E When John Downing took the classic picture of a stunned Margaret Thatcher leaving the Imperial hotel in Brighton, England, after the IRA had bombed it, he had been having a drink in the bar. The bomb went off and John couldn't get to his room to get his \\u2018proper' cameras. But he he had a Canon Sureshot, the same as my mum used on holiday, in his pocket.  And it was on the Sureshot that the pic was made.  That makes it a professional camera in my book. Cameras are not professional, people are. An Olympus Pen in Sebastaio Delgado's hands is a professional camera. A Nikon D4 in my sister's is not.

A better camera will not make you a better photographer.  I own both an EOS R and a 5D mark IV. They're basically the same camera in most regards. I got my R as a backup / second body, and for that role it's ideal for my needs\\u2026 and $1100 cheaper than a second 5D4. Canon is heavily discounting the R and Rp to encourage people to move to the RF mount.  Having used both side by side for nearly a year now, I have to say that the controls on the 5D4 are vastly superior. It is much easier to control, particularly for demanding tasks like sports and wildlife photography. The control layout on the 5D4 is more or less the same as every high-end EOS camera going back to the film days, which makes it very easy to transition between cameras. That's important if you are a pro who shoots with multiple bodies, less so if you're a more casual shooter who only uses one camera. The R is set up different enough that it slows me down and forces me to adjust. It's less of an adjustment to switch to between my 5D4 and an EOS 1V film body than it is to switch between it and the R.  The full-time EVF on the EOS R is nice in low light and for video, but you have the basically the same capability with live view on the 5D4. The EVF takes a sizable fraction of a second to come online, which has caused me to miss many great candid shots waiting for it to wake up. A DSLR is ready to go instantly. The EVF does make it easier to use face-tracking autofocus, and the increased area of AF coverage is nice. Face tracking is not a feature I use much in the studio where I do most of my work, but it has some useful applications. If I did street photography, face tracking would be an important feature. The R eats batteries like crazy so the battery grip is basically mandatory anything serious. I use a battery grip on all my cameras so I prefer that configuration anyway.  That said, the R is a highly capable camera that can produce professional quality results. There are situations where I will grab it in preference to my 5D4 if I'm only carrying one camera. Image quality is identical to the 5D4 \\u2014 unsurprising, since they use the exact same sensor. The RF-EF mount adapter works perfectly with all of my EF mount lenses (Canon and Sigma).  Is the 5D mark IV a better camera? Overall, I'd say yes, by a narrow margin. Is the difference enough to justify paying $2700 vs $1600? Probably not, at least for most photographers.

It radically alters how we build applications online and makes it possible to applications previously not possible.  Ethereum, one of the most talked about blockchain platforms, is competing to become the next generation foundation for building applications. However, it is now under threat from what has been described as the Ethereum killer.  EOS, is the latest blockchain platform out of the blocks. It is causing a stir amongst blockchain experts, who are super excited by its potential. Analysts say it is will make other blockchain platforms obsolete.  Here are 5 reason why EOS might make Ethereum obsolete  EOS has superior technology compared to Ethereum  EOS was developed after the proliferation of multiple blockchain experiments like Ethereum. All of them attempt to lure in developers, enterprises and users to their platform. Unfortunately, the limits of their technology are a drag on what is possible.  Ethereum, suffers a limitation of transactional throughput. Because of a process known as serialization, transactions on it are limited to being processed sequentially. Therefore, all processes that go through its blockchain, cannot be processed simultaneously. Instead, they have to be processed in the order they are received relative to other transactions.  The EOS platform, recognized this limitation, and solved it by implementing asynchronous communication and parallel processing of transactions. This means multiple transactions running on EOS do not have to queue and wait their turn. Rather, they all get processed together, simultaneously on a distributed network. This is a remarkable feat in transactional capacity.  With this capability, EOS can handle more transactions, scale faster and to a wider audience than what is possible with Ethereum.  EOS can process more transactions per second than Ethereum  For blockchain platforms to become successful, they need to accommodate a ton of traffic on their network. The number of transactions a network can handle per second is a metric for comparing blockchain performance.  At its peak on June 11th, 2017, Ethereum experienced one of its highest traffic on the network. Unfortunately, even at its peak, it could only handle a throughput of 5.2 transactions per second. In the cryptocurrency world, this may seem impressive. However, for commercial grade applications, it is merely a drop in the bucket. With hundreds of banks, governments and major companies looking to build blockchain applications, much more is required.  EOS identified the folly of the current blockchain transaction capacity models. So they have implemented asynchronous communication and parallelization. With parallelization, multiple transactions are processed simultaneously, enabling horizontal scalability of the network. In addition, EOS has adopted Graphene technology, which has been proved to achieve 10,000 - 100,000 transactions per second.  Combining both technologies, EOS can achieve a modest 300,000 transactions per second. But, this is only the beginning. The road map is to scale to process 1 million transactions per second. EOS will support the bandwidth requirements of commercial and enterprise grade applications. For context, facebook and google handle about 52,000 and 40,000 transactions per second respectively.  Mass adoption of blockchains boils down to the scaling ability of platforms. EOS has scalability at the core of its design.  EOS has zero transactions fees while Ethereum's fees are going higher  Blockchain networks typically consume resources for security and processing. The de facto approach has been to pay the owners of resources. Miners collect fees from users to keep the network running. This design however, is detrimental to lowering the barrier of adoption.  The Ethereum blockchain enables developers to build decentralized applications at no cost. The downside is users pay the price for consuming the network's resources. Users of Ethereum applications have to pay fees for every transaction processed by miners. Every storage operation, bandwidth use and calculation has to pay gas fees which is expressed in Ether. The amount of fees is calculated based on the complexity of the transaction.  If users do not pay enough fees, their transactions are excluded. It is worse because fees can change at any time and there is no way to predict in advance.  EOS was built from the ground up to do away with this insane model. To onboard users en mass, it needs to be cheap to use applications on platforms. For this reasons, transactions on EOS incur zero fees. This model eliminates the hassle of purchasing cryptocurrency to pay network fees. Additionally, developers also do not incur any cost to run applications on EOS. All they need, is to hold a certain number of EOS tokens that assures them a preset allocation of bandwidth.  EOS's zero fee approach to onboarding users and developers on its platform is by far superior to Ethereum's pay to use fee model.  EOS's Daniel Larimer has more experience building blockchain versus Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin  Blockchain's are a relatively new technology, that combine decades worth of prior art. It takes years of experience programming in different fields and a big picture view of the future to build one.  Vitalik Buterin, was barely out of high school when he set out to build the Ethereum blockchain. He started out as a cryptocurrency writer for Bitcoin magazine and opted not to go to college. 14 months later, he joined teams working on digital assets protocols - Mastercoin and Coloured coins.  While on these projects, he witnessed first hand the limitation of protocols built on Bitcoin. So he conceived the idea of Ethereum, an independent blockchain in 2014, but lacked the developer skills to build it from scratch. He had to find other developers to help him make Ethereum a reality.  Dan Larimer on the other hand, graduated from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in 2003 with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science. He worked on various projects such as a virtual reality simulator and unmanned vehicle control systems.  In the early days, Dan worked closely with Satoshi Nakamoto refining bitcoin. He realized its shortcomings and moved on to build a high performance decentralized exchange known as BitShares. 2 years later, he built Steemit, a social media site powered by blockchain. Steemit is hailed as the most user friendly blockchain to date.  Dan's ground breaking technology Graphene was used for both Bitshares and Steemit. Both combined have more blockchain transaction activity per day than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitshares processes between 600,000 - 700,000 transactions per day, while Steemit handles 120,000 transactions per day.  As the CTO of EOS, Dan has brought his experience, lessons and technology from previous projects. EOS combines all the great qualities of Bitshares and Steemit to come up with a superior blockchain platform.  Final Thought  People don't realize that there are other ways to earn great profits on cryptocurrency rather than just buying them. For example, investing with trusted Non-Ponzi cryptocurrency investment companies for profits, companies like Cryptobond (www.cryptobond.tech) pay double your cryptocurrencies (Ethereum, EOS and others) in 7 days of investment, isn't that great?  Developers, entrepreneurs, Banks, fortune 500 companies and governments have expressed interest in building blockchain applications. Current blockchain platforms such as Ethereum are limited in scalability, fees and throughput. They were not designed from the ground up with commercial applications in mind. Attempting to do the major changes necessary now is like trying to disassemble an engine while it is running  EOS is building a blockchain platform for scale, ease of use and millions of transactions per second. It is incorporating the lessons and failure of existing blockchain models. With an eye on the future of commercial adoption, EOS has a leg up on Ethereum, by building to remedy the failures."}, {"upvote": 150, "content": "Yes definitely, especially since Vitalik Buterin proposed a month ago the accelerated transition from ETH 1.0 to ETH 2.0 [ https://ethresear.ch/t/alternative-proposal-for-early-eth1-eth2-merge/6666 ].

Do not get this line of thinking stuck in your head because it's not entirely true. In fact, to be honest, this statement is used many times by people who simply can't afford good gear and are jealous at those who can. If you can't afford good gear right now, that's fine; work with what you can afford and save up money to grow into better gear over time. The best camera is always the one you have with you and by this I mean, if you own a $6,500 Canon 1DX and it's sitting at home, your best camera may be the free one that came built into the phone in your pocket!  While it is true, skill is the most important aspect of almost anything, including photography, your gear and even more specifically, your lenses, are just as important. A good lens on an inexpensive camera is always better than a cheap lens on an expensive camera. If you're just starting out and looking for a camera for a beginner, try to think about what sort of photography you'll be doing. General photography such as family photos, photos of your friends, pets, etc.; landscape photography; wildlife photography; street photography, etc. If you don't know yet, that's okay but if you have a goal of developing skills specific to one of these styles, it will help with camera selection.  When getting started, I'd get something inexpensive but not so cheap that your photo quality ends up discouraging you altogether (again, this is where the \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" nonsense kicks in.) I'll cover a couple types and why they're good starter cameras. And with any camera you choose, always try to keep the camera out of \\\"automatic mode\\\" if possible so you begin to master the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  Point-and-Shoot or Camera Phone  These cameras are very inexpensive and with the newer smartphones, the camera is built right in and often takes better photos than the DSLR's from just a few years ago! This is the most inexpensive route to take (and may not cost a penny if you use the camera on your phone) and it helps you learn about composition, lighting, etc. If you're already past this point and want a camera you can grow into, the following are good options:  Traditional SLR's  I know, this is probably not what most people think of when deciding on a beginner's camera but I want to mention it because if you have one of these lying around in your house (parent's or grandparent's old camera, etc.), they're great for learning the basics of a camera with all of the digital stuff removed. SLR (single lens reflex) cameras aren't used much anymore because of the cost of operation, decreased photo quality, and lack of film processing labs, however, I think any aspiring photographer should own or at least use one because they are the \\\"original camera\\\", they are inexpensive, and they help give you a greater appreciation for the luxury of digital photography (not limited to 24-36 photos per roll, immediate results where you can see your photo seconds after taking it, easy and fast multiple frame shooting, and no cost by ruining a roll of film or wasting it on bad photos.) If you buy a traditional SLR 35mm camera, I'd go for something like the Nikon 35mm F2AS with a 50mm \\\"prime lens\\\", or similar. Here's a photo of one of mine:  Digital SLR's  Digital SLR's, or DSLR's, have been the most popular choice for many years now, they're easy to find used, and they're a good starting point in learning photography. These cameras are basically digital versions of the original SLR camera but offer much more flexibility and many more options. Whagt we're seeing right now, however, is a switch from DSLR's to \\\"mirrorless cameras\\\", including the very popular \\\"Micro Four Thirds\\\" cameras which use a smaller sensor, yet often outperform the DSLR's. I'll touch on those, below. Anyway, an inexpensive or used DSLR is a good choice for starting out and I'd recommend an entry level Canon DSLR such as one of the \\\"Rebel\\\" series cameras. I currently use a Canon 1DX which is NOT a beginner's camera, and my old Canon 5D Mark II (this is a great beginner's camera, easy to find, and inexpensive.) Here's a photo of the Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm prime lens attached:  Mirrorless Cameras  These cameras really are \\\"the future of photography\\\" although many professional photographers would scoff at you for even suggesting such a thing because just as it was when SLR's were phasing out, DSLR using pro's often get stuck in their ways and refuse to move with the times. Even today there are professional photographers who refuse to switch from SLR to DSLR! Mirrorless cameras are superior to DSLR's in almost every way: They have higher resolution (megapixels) for a fraction of the cost of DSLR's; there's no mirror flapping around making noise and causing camera vibration; they're smaller and easier to carry, many can shoot 4K and even Cinema 4K video (while Canon and Nikon refuse to adapt and offer this feature for a reasonable price in their DSLR's); and overall, they're less expensive. If you can afford one (they're often cheaper than many new DSLR's), go for it! I currently shoot with a Panasonic Lumix GH4 because I shoot photography AND I need to shoot 4K video and this camera does both. An even less expensive alternative is the Lumix GH3 which sells for around $500, a quarter of the price of the GH4. Here's a photo of the Lumix GH4, a \\\"mirrorless camera\\\":  Regardless of what you choose, unless it's a cheap $30 point-and-shoot or your phone's camera, try to make a decision on which camera format you want to grow into, otherwise you'll be wasting money on a camera and the expensive lenses that you'll end up not using when you switch to a different format.  Taking an introductory photography class or workshop is also a good idea when getting started as you'll more quickly learn the basics including aperture, exposure, shutter speed, composition, and editing.

Not only is the 1D X around $6,000 (body-only), but you're going to need expensive CFast cards for 4K video, and the 4K video on the thing is in gigantic Motion JPEG files, and not all that amazing anyway. If I wanted a 4K camera for video, I'd recommend either get a Panasonic GH4 or perhaps a Sony A7s mark II.  The Nikon D80 (2006) and the D3 (2007) are ancient models and don't shoot video. The D3s does shoot video, but only 720p, not full HD.  The EOS 7D (2009) is also fairly old. It can shoot 720p or 1080p video, but only 12 minutes at a time. The others here can shoot 29\\u203259\\u2033 without stopping \\u2014 that's a limit set to avoid paying a European camcorder tax. While it doesn't apply at all in the USA, most camera manufacturers (other than Panasonic, far as I know) impose this limit even on North American and Japanese models.  The Nikon D5300 isn't a bad choice for video. It's a few models old, it came out in 2003, the current model is the D5600, so it's may be available for a value price. But this line is a consumer line, APS-C sensor, and not terribly expensive. It can shoot video at 1080p up to 60fps\\u2026 not something you'd need for vlogging, but you want 60p for sports or other action video. Another advantage for vlogging, the D5300 has built-in WiFi, so it can be controlled wirelessly via an app. Most Canon and Nikon can be tethered via USB for remote control, and some have add-on controls, but it's handy to have it built-in.  I have the EOS 6D, and it produces amazing video, particularly in low light, where it blows away my far more expensive dedicated camcorders. The 6D right now is a good bargain, but mostly because everyone expects Canon to announce the 6D mark II Real Soon Now. The 6D also has built-in WiFi.  The EOS 5D mark III is the upgrade of Canon's breakthrough EOS 5D mark II. It's a great camera, one of the go-to standards for video-on-stills camera shooting. But while it's a solid choice if you can afford it, it's not the best choice. For one, it's been superceeded by the EOS 5D mark IV, if you're looking for a higher end model that shoots great video.  Of those on your list, the Canon EOS 80D would be my choice for anyone wanting a strong video option. Like the Nikon, it can shoot a variety of modes up to 1080p60. But the real advantage is in the sensor. This is Canon's second-generation mid-range DSLR with what they call a Dual Pixel sensor. This sensor splits each pixel into two separate photodiodes. Based on the way they're masked, each sensor pair works like a phase-detect autofocus sensor. So unlike every other DSLR on your list, the 80D can give you full performance autofocus in video, and things you usually just find on camcorders and mirrorless cameras, like follow-focus in video, etc. Dual Pixel is also used on Canon's 5D mark IV and all the new Cinema EOS video cameras. And the 80D also has built-in WiFi.  Far as the larger idea of a full camera system goes, you can't really go wrong with either Canon or Nikon. They have the two most complete lines of cameras and two most complete collection of lenses. However, neither offers a mirrorless option. So that means you're only shooting video from the back screen, not the viewfinder. And that only the 80D on your list has fully function video autofocus\\u2026 the others will AF in video, but it's on demand, not continuous, and it's often not very good. The phase detect sensors that DSLRs use are not available with the mirror up, which is what you have in video mode.  For one-person vlogging, keep in mind you are going to want to see yourself, which means either an add-on monitor while shooting or an articulated screen. The 80D and the D5300 both have fully articulated screens which let you see what you're recording from the front of the camera. The others do not, and will absolutely require an external monitor for vlogging."}, {"upvote": 2, "content": "Thanks for the A2A. You asked: I have CANON EOS 7D.

The price movement of top currencies remains a mystery. But it doesn't have to be.  THE PAIN OF UNCERTAINTY  Cryptocurrencies are volatile, irrational beasts.  Simple methods of forecasting grossly over/underestimate the potential of a volatile currency.  For example, moving averages are used frequently to estimate future prices. Moving averages, however, suffer from many pitfalls [ http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/11/pitfalls-moving-averages.asp?lgl=rira-layout ] that make them poor estimators of volatile markets.  Every great and successful investor has a plan. You will add one more tool to your arsenal today.  A BETTER METHOD FOR ESTIMATING CRYPTO PRICES  In my prior article about estimating the movement of Bitcoin Prices [ https://medium.com/@spreadstreet/bitcoin-madness-how-to-simulate-bitcoin-prices-in-google-sheets-c61cb42f26ed ], I spoke of a method that is used frequently in the stock world to estimate prices.  This method is a Monte Carlo simulation using the geometric Brownian motion model.  I won't cover off on the full methodology here, but essentially I am going to:  1. Get historical daily prices for 10 top cryptocurrencies 2. Calculate daily returns 3. Simulate a year 4.

There are also lots of possibilities in between.  Was that the answer you were looking for? Of course not. You want as exact an answer as one could possibly provide, down to the penny.  The thing is that that was the answer you needed.  So many things can happen with Ethereum over the course of 2018. Below, allow me to explain what could potentially make Ethereum crumble and what could make Ethereum skyrocket.  Disaster scenarios:  1. China, South Korea and other Asian countries ban cryptocurrency trading and mining. We've already seen cryptos across the board plummet by -20% within the hour just because of *speculation* that Asian governments might ban trading and mining. Just imagine if they actually see that threat through. 2. Another major exchange gets hacked. Could you imagine if Coinbase got hacked? You'd see the price of all cryptos deflate like a popped balloon within seconds. With the proliferation of cryptos and resulting exchanges, we should expect more exchanges to get hacked in 2018. Depending on the size of the hacked exchanges, you may see prices either barely move or you may see the Earth split in two. 3. Buterin and Ethereum developers get hacked and/or fail to deliver on their lofty promises. If there were to be a successful attack on the very Ethereum core team you could see Ether (and Ether alone) plunge dramatically. Payday scenarios:  1. Buterin & Co. implement Casper/Proof of Stake. This is a first to the finish line race out of the major cryptos and Ethereum is easily leading the way. Whenever (not if ever) Ethereum implements PoS, hold on tight because it's going to be wild. If Bitcoin doesn't switch to PoS at the same time you could easily see Ether overtake Bitcoin on the coin value to USD pair within a short span of time. 2. Corporations and/or major developers start utilizing Ethereum for everyday processes or decentralized apps are released to the public. Both of these would drive demand for Ether up dramatically as more and more potential holders seek to buy and either up their stake in Ether or enter for the first time. 3. Bitcoin continues to not really do anything useful. It's interesting how Bitcoin has primarily become little more than a store of value rather than an actual currency. With the current technical headwinds that Bitcoin is facing, we shouldn't expect this to change any time soon. I mean there are very good reasons why major corporations are flocking to Ethereum and not to Bitcoin. I suspect that we will continue to see that trend continue here in 2018, if not speed up even more. Those are the biggest factors that I can think of. Of course all of this is not to be taken as any kind of investment advice as I am no financial adviser.

So I am only going to talk about this aspect. Obviously if you want to make phone calls, surf the web and check your bank balance, you have to use the iPhone.  If you are seriously interested in pictures, get the camera. Certainly, the iPhone can take nice snapshots, reasonably sharp, good color balance, and plenty of megapixels. One downside with the camera is that, in order to achieve the functionality of the iPhone, you will have to spend a lot on lenses - the phone has a fairly wide zoom range, the camera comes with a ~3x zoom lens. Add-on lenses range from a few hundred to thousands each - a modest wide-range lens will cost about $500 - and still likely be less than the zoom built into the phone.  So what will the camera give you? It will give you\\u2026   * a much much much MUCH larger sensor. The larger sensor causes less noise (speckles) in dark areas, and less smudging of details by the noise reduction software that tries to reduce the effects of the noise.  * better control of all aspects of the picture-taking process. This means you can use a very fast shutter speed to freeze action (good for sports), or a narrow aperture (the hole in the lens that light goes through) to give a very deep field of focus - things close up and on the horizon are all in focus. Equally, a wide aperture will give a very narrow depth of field - good for a portrait where the face or whatever you're photographing is sharp, but the background is out of focus - so the subject is more pronounced. You can also change the ISO - the sensitivity of the sensor - to allow photography in really low light (high ISO) or with for maximum detail you want low ISO (and bright light!).  * Raw image storage. Save the image exactly as it was captured by the sensor with no processing to remove noise. This potentially give the best possible image when processed later with a PC. I've gone into too much detail already, and there are still many areas I have not touched. This camera is not jut a device for taking pictures, it is the beginning of a whole new interest in it own right. You will need to get more lenses, at the very least a basic 75\\u2013300 mm zoom lens for about $150, and likely a gadget bag, filters, memory cards, perhaps a flash gun,\\u2026 And when you get into lenses, the better (professional grade) lenses do create noticeably better images. We're talking $1000+ each here. And even +++.  The other thing the SLR will give you is overall better quality pictures. They are sharper, have better colours, and so on. You've seen the pictures in good magazines compared with snapshots on Facebook. Professionals typically use SLR (or better) cameras.  If you just want to be able to take reasonable snapshots, go with the phone.  If you want picture quality, go for the camera.  The other option, if you want the control and quality (almost) of a dSLR with the cost and convenience of the phone, there are many quality compact cameras you can choose. They have a zoom range like the iPhone, a lens close to the dSLR lenses, and the creative control approaching the dSLR. For around $400 you may find the best of both worlds. All the major brands have offerings in this field. This website compares a selection of current cameras that may meet your needs: 2016 Roundup: Consumer Long Zoom Compacts [ https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/2016-roundup-consumer-long-zoom-compacts/9 ] .

For anything in low light conditions or with a fast moving subject, the phone will always lose. It's a matter of physics. The capture sensor in a professional camera is much larger than the tiny sensor on a cellphone, so it can capture much more light in the same amount of time. Because the sensor is so much larger, it also requires larger lenses, which offer additional possibilities - you can get extreme zoom via optical means rather than the fake digital zoom that cellphone cameras use, you can use different apertures for depth of field effects, you can play with the shutter speed to create selective blur, etc. The CPU in the camera is also dedicated exclusively to imaging, so it processes photos much faster, allowing for faster burst photography.

But even so, I don't consider myself to be a professional.  To me, the word professional is very ambiguous. The real meaning of the word \\\"professional\\\" is that you are making a living out of your photography, so in this case the camera must be able to produce photos with image quality that surpass the minimum photo-publishing requirements. In this case, a 700D with its 18MP Canon sensor that's also being used in the 7D meets the requirement, as the image quality produced by the 700D will satisfy at the very least the minimum standard requirement of many photographers; so it's safe to say it's good enough to be considered a \\\"professional camera\\\". A lot of low-budget studios where I live, which I consider to be professional photography studio, even still use the good-old 500D for passport headshots and similar stuffs, and they make money from it; that makes the 500D a \\\"professional camera\\\". I'm pretty sure that the photos from the 700D are also good enough to even get pass the very strict requirement of a lot of professional stock photography agencies. So there's that one kind of professional.    On the other hand, the assumed meaning of the word \\\"professional camera\\\" that the camera manufacturers and marketing departments tried to emphasize to us is the camera with the most feature packed with a very high price-level. Well, in this case, the 700D is not a professional camera, and the manufacturer will push you towards a 7D, 5D or 1D, in hope that you'll buy those products with a much higher margin to both cover the operational cost of the manufacturer and make more profit for the company. They don't care if you make a living out of your camera or not, but the 7D, 6D, 5D, and 1D are professional cameras. That's another kind of professional.  Now let's discuss the 700D specifically. I don't personally own the 700D but I used to own a 650D for one year, and it's spec'ed very similar to the 700D. The 650D/700D can shoot 18MP RAW or JPEG with a CMOS sensor that's very similar to the sensor on the high-end Canon 7D. It does shoot at 4 or 5fps burst image, it shoot 30fps video at 1080p, it has a decent viewfinder, and a good all-around control as well as menu.   Upgrading from a 650D/700D to a 7D, a \\\"professional\\\" camera, will give you faster burst image at 8fps, weather-sealing, better view-finder, more extensive manual control, and a heavier body. But it will not give you a better image quality.   Upgrading to a 5D Mark III will give you a somewhat cleaner image quality at high ISO, better control, better viewfinder, weather-sealing, better video output, but you're back with 5fps burst speed, and you'll have to invest to full-frame lenses.   Upgrading to 1D, you'll get 7D fast-performance with an almost-5D-like image quality, but it'll cost you as much as a used decent car.  Now the important question that you'll have to ask for yourself is: will you make more money if you have a 7D, 6D, 5D, or a 1D? Maybe yes, maybe no. But one thing for sure, you'll have to spend more money to buy those cameras than if you buy the 700D. Can you justify that? Do you really need to have those features on those so-called professional cameras, or can you live with just the features on the 700D?  I personally don't give too much thought about using the so-called professional cameras. As long as I can deliver the results needed by the clients or by yourself, I think I'm happy. My 650D could deliver the result that I require back then, and to my book, it's good enough. I don't know about you, nor do I know about your photography requirement, so I can't speak for you.  To conclude, I quoted a small part of David Thorpe's blog post with the title \\\"Is This Camera Professional\\\". David Thorpe is an ex-photojournalist from UK, a true professional photographer in my opinion. Here's that quote:   %3E When John Downing took the classic picture of a stunned Margaret Thatcher leaving the Imperial hotel in Brighton, England, after the IRA had bombed it, he had been having a drink in the bar. The bomb went off and John couldn't get to his room to get his \\u2018proper' cameras. But he he had a Canon Sureshot, the same as my mum used on holiday, in his pocket.  And it was on the Sureshot that the pic was made.  That makes it a professional camera in my book. Cameras are not professional, people are. An Olympus Pen in Sebastaio Delgado's hands is a professional camera. A Nikon D4 in my sister's is not. Here's the link to that blog post \\\"Is this Camera Professional?\\\" [ http://m43blog.dthorpe.net/2014/10/23/is-this-camera-professional/ ]   I hope I helped you with my answer. Good luck!

Not only is the 1D X around $6,000 (body-only), but you're going to need expensive CFast cards for 4K video, and the 4K video on the thing is in gigantic Motion JPEG files, and not all that amazing anyway. If I wanted a 4K camera for video, I'd recommend either get a Panasonic GH4 or perhaps a Sony A7s mark II.  The Nikon D80 (2006) and the D3 (2007) are ancient models and don't shoot video. The D3s does shoot video, but only 720p, not full HD.  The EOS 7D (2009) is also fairly old. It can shoot 720p or 1080p video, but only 12 minutes at a time. The others here can shoot 29\\u203259\\u2033 without stopping \\u2014 that's a limit set to avoid paying a European camcorder tax. While it doesn't apply at all in the USA, most camera manufacturers (other than Panasonic, far as I know) impose this limit even on North American and Japanese models.  The Nikon D5300 isn't a bad choice for video. It's a few models old, it came out in 2003, the current model is the D5600, so it's may be available for a value price. But this line is a consumer line, APS-C sensor, and not terribly expensive. It can shoot video at 1080p up to 60fps\\u2026 not something you'd need for vlogging, but you want 60p for sports or other action video. Another advantage for vlogging, the D5300 has built-in WiFi, so it can be controlled wirelessly via an app. Most Canon and Nikon can be tethered via USB for remote control, and some have add-on controls, but it's handy to have it built-in.  I have the EOS 6D, and it produces amazing video, particularly in low light, where it blows away my far more expensive dedicated camcorders. The 6D right now is a good bargain, but mostly because everyone expects Canon to announce the 6D mark II Real Soon Now. The 6D also has built-in WiFi.  The EOS 5D mark III is the upgrade of Canon's breakthrough EOS 5D mark II. It's a great camera, one of the go-to standards for video-on-stills camera shooting. But while it's a solid choice if you can afford it, it's not the best choice. For one, it's been superceeded by the EOS 5D mark IV, if you're looking for a higher end model that shoots great video.  Of those on your list, the Canon EOS 80D would be my choice for anyone wanting a strong video option. Like the Nikon, it can shoot a variety of modes up to 1080p60. But the real advantage is in the sensor. This is Canon's second-generation mid-range DSLR with what they call a Dual Pixel sensor. This sensor splits each pixel into two separate photodiodes. Based on the way they're masked, each sensor pair works like a phase-detect autofocus sensor. So unlike every other DSLR on your list, the 80D can give you full performance autofocus in video, and things you usually just find on camcorders and mirrorless cameras, like follow-focus in video, etc. Dual Pixel is also used on Canon's 5D mark IV and all the new Cinema EOS video cameras. And the 80D also has built-in WiFi.  Far as the larger idea of a full camera system goes, you can't really go wrong with either Canon or Nikon. They have the two most complete lines of cameras and two most complete collection of lenses. However, neither offers a mirrorless option. So that means you're only shooting video from the back screen, not the viewfinder. And that only the 80D on your list has fully function video autofocus\\u2026 the others will AF in video, but it's on demand, not continuous, and it's often not very good. The phase detect sensors that DSLRs use are not available with the mirror up, which is what you have in video mode.  For one-person vlogging, keep in mind you are going to want to see yourself, which means either an add-on monitor while shooting or an articulated screen. The 80D and the D5300 both have fully articulated screens which let you see what you're recording from the front of the camera. The others do not, and will absolutely require an external monitor for vlogging."}, {"upvote": 3, "content": "The Canon EOS 700 D is classed as an \\u2018Entry level camera'.

"}, {"upvote": 78, "content": "I see a lot of answers claiming \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" for photography in general. Do not get this line of thinking stuck in your head because it's not entirely true. In fact, to be honest, this statement is used many times by people who simply can't afford good gear and are jealous at those who can. If you can't afford good gear right now, that's fine; work with what you can afford and save up money to grow into better gear over time. The best camera is always the one you have with you and by this I mean, if you own a $6,500 Canon 1DX and it's sitting at home, your best camera may be the free one that came built into the phone in your pocket!  While it is true, skill is the most important aspect of almost anything, including photography, your gear and even more specifically, your lenses, are just as important. A good lens on an inexpensive camera is always better than a cheap lens on an expensive camera. If you're just starting out and looking for a camera for a beginner, try to think about what sort of photography you'll be doing. General photography such as family photos, photos of your friends, pets, etc.; landscape photography; wildlife photography; street photography, etc. If you don't know yet, that's okay but if you have a goal of developing skills specific to one of these styles, it will help with camera selection.  When getting started, I'd get something inexpensive but not so cheap that your photo quality ends up discouraging you altogether (again, this is where the \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" nonsense kicks in.) I'll cover a couple types and why they're good starter cameras. And with any camera you choose, always try to keep the camera out of \\\"automatic mode\\\" if possible so you begin to master the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  Point-and-Shoot or Camera Phone  These cameras are very inexpensive and with the newer smartphones, the camera is built right in and often takes better photos than the DSLR's from just a few years ago! This is the most inexpensive route to take (and may not cost a penny if you use the camera on your phone) and it helps you learn about composition, lighting, etc. If you're already past this point and want a camera you can grow into, the following are good options:  Traditional SLR's  I know, this is probably not what most people think of when deciding on a beginner's camera but I want to mention it because if you have one of these lying around in your house (parent's or grandparent's old camera, etc.), they're great for learning the basics of a camera with all of the digital stuff removed. SLR (single lens reflex) cameras aren't used much anymore because of the cost of operation, decreased photo quality, and lack of film processing labs, however, I think any aspiring photographer should own or at least use one because they are the \\\"original camera\\\", they are inexpensive, and they help give you a greater appreciation for the luxury of digital photography (not limited to 24-36 photos per roll, immediate results where you can see your photo seconds after taking it, easy and fast multiple frame shooting, and no cost by ruining a roll of film or wasting it on bad photos.) If you buy a traditional SLR 35mm camera, I'd go for something like the Nikon 35mm F2AS with a 50mm \\\"prime lens\\\", or similar. Here's a photo of one of mine:  Digital SLR's  Digital SLR's, or DSLR's, have been the most popular choice for many years now, they're easy to find used, and they're a good starting point in learning photography. These cameras are basically digital versions of the original SLR camera but offer much more flexibility and many more options. Whagt we're seeing right now, however, is a switch from DSLR's to \\\"mirrorless cameras\\\", including the very popular \\\"Micro Four Thirds\\\" cameras which use a smaller sensor, yet often outperform the DSLR's. I'll touch on those, below. Anyway, an inexpensive or used DSLR is a good choice for starting out and I'd recommend an entry level Canon DSLR such as one of the \\\"Rebel\\\" series cameras. I currently use a Canon 1DX which is NOT a beginner's camera, and my old Canon 5D Mark II (this is a great beginner's camera, easy to find, and inexpensive.) Here's a photo of the Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm prime lens attached:  Mirrorless Cameras  These cameras really are \\\"the future of photography\\\" although many professional photographers would scoff at you for even suggesting such a thing because just as it was when SLR's were phasing out, DSLR using pro's often get stuck in their ways and refuse to move with the times. Even today there are professional photographers who refuse to switch from SLR to DSLR! Mirrorless cameras are superior to DSLR's in almost every way: They have higher resolution (megapixels) for a fraction of the cost of DSLR's; there's no mirror flapping around making noise and causing camera vibration; they're smaller and easier to carry, many can shoot 4K and even Cinema 4K video (while Canon and Nikon refuse to adapt and offer this feature for a reasonable price in their DSLR's); and overall, they're less expensive. If you can afford one (they're often cheaper than many new DSLR's), go for it! I currently shoot with a Panasonic Lumix GH4 because I shoot photography AND I need to shoot 4K video and this camera does both. An even less expensive alternative is the Lumix GH3 which sells for around $500, a quarter of the price of the GH4. Here's a photo of the Lumix GH4, a \\\"mirrorless camera\\\":  Regardless of what you choose, unless it's a cheap $30 point-and-shoot or your phone's camera, try to make a decision on which camera format you want to grow into, otherwise you'll be wasting money on a camera and the expensive lenses that you'll end up not using when you switch to a different format.  Taking an introductory photography class or workshop is also a good idea when getting started as you'll more quickly learn the basics including aperture, exposure, shutter speed, composition, and editing. Good luck with your search and your journey into photography!"}, {"upvote": 8, "content": "One of these photos was taken with a brand new 5D mark IV. The other was taken with a 8 year old 7D using the same lens (Sigma 150\\u2013600 Sport). Can you tell which is which?  The lens matters far more to image quality than anything else.  The 6D mk II is a full frame camera and the 90D is a crop sensor camera. They have the same autofocus system (45 point dual-pixel). The 90D has a higher burst rate (10 frames/sec vs 6.5). The 6D mk 2 has a higher maximum ISO (40,000 vs 25,000).  All else being equal, a crop sensor camera is going to be better if you are mostly doing sports or wildlife photography \\u2014 the higher frame rate is better for action photography, and the crop factor gives your telephoto lenses extra reach.

Purchase the 18-55mm if you're never going to shoot moving vehicles. Properly focused and steadied, you'll get sharp results suitable for most applications. If you're shooting for publication, a photo editor might prefer results from a better-quality lens. But they really don't care what you shoot it with if they like the results.  However...  Telephotos For Auto Sports Before quality zooms were available, 200mm was the most widely-used lens for auto races and other sports. A 200mm f/2.8 gives tight depth of field wide-open for good subject isolation, but I've gotten good isolation close in with f/3.5 or f/4. For most photography, closer is better. Zoom with your feet.  And For Other Sports Shooting professional mountain bike races, I routinely have an EOS 7D with a 70-200mm f/2.8L IS over one shoulder, and an EOS 5D mk II with a 24-70mm f/2.8L over the other. That works well for dual slalom, downhill, cross-country, racers scouting the course beforehand, podium shots, and merchandise / cars / team trailers in the venue.   I would certainly purchase the 18-55mm first. But understand you'll probably want the 55-250mm or a 70-200mm sooner or later.  Consider Flash You'll likely also want at least one small strobe like a 430EX. When you're shooting models in front of cars at an auto show, fill flash gives better-looking results. It also gives you creative options for highlighting important parts of your subject.  Buy It Used Find good used lenses at a camera store to stretch your budget.

That a really usual range for covering most of what's interesting in everyday life. The huge kit zoom gives you plenty of firepower exactly where you least need it. It's not really a great lens for working as a field photographer - and you only really need the tele reach at the far end for wildlife. The big kit zoom is perfect for a day at the zoo, and nothing else.  One other answer notes the big zoom is perfect for portraits. Perfect is a stretch, but he is right about your needing more reach to takeaway good portrait.  Another fellow says Sigma 17-70mm and I agree. The extra wide is where everyday life takes place on a crop sensor camera. You can shoot a very good head and shoulders portrait at 55mm, albeit you are standing a little too close for comfort for a stranger or a model. For a head and shoulders, 50mm puts you about 6 feet away from the model. Any closer bugs people. 70mm would put you about 9 feet out. That's a lot more comfortable for both of you.  If you want to close in to 6 feet you could shoot a portrait where the face fills the screen. You can honestly spend you whole life between 17-70mm. I rarely shoot past that range unless I am bird-watching and that's quite specific. The long kit would not be good enough, or long enough.  It's early days for you but I would seriously consider an M42 adaptor and vintage lenses.

It provides uncropped 10-bit 4:2:2 8K videos at 30fps as well as 4k at 60fps and 1080p at 120fps.  EOS R6 inherited the 20.1-megapixel full-frame sensor from the 1D X Mark III. Does not offer 8K shooting like the R5, but it does have uncropped 10-bit 4:2:2 4K videos at 60fps as well as 1080p at 120fps. R6 also has a lower resolution EVF than the R5, and the other main difference is that the R6 does not have a top LCD panel like the R5 does.

I'll been needing to live with it for a good year :-)  I'm actually really happy to see the Canon EOS R5. I left Canon back in 2018, mostly because I was getting more out of my Olympus gear. I grokked the whole mirrorless thing, found it better than optical. I could actually use my old manual lenses much more effectively than on an DSLR.  But part of it was their basic attitude. Kasey Stern, the genius behind the Camera Conspiracies vlog, pretty much expressed my main problem with Canon. It was absolutely clear, over the years, that Canon was arbitrarily holding back the level of technology on lower-end cameras to sell higher-end cameras\\u2026 regardless of the actual cost of those features. If you're the only camera company in the world and doing that, maybe that's okay. But they were not\\u2026. there are other camera companies.  So in 2015, I had bought a few Olympus Micro Four Thirds cameras, which I was using as a secondary system\\u2026 for when I didn't want to drag along my 10kg+ Canon system. I bought the OM-D E-M5 Mark II that year. First thing to note was that, even thought this was a mid-range camera, they didn't reduce features in any way that wasn't an obvious additional expense. In fact, they introduced a bunch of new features on this model that the flagship OM-D E-M1 didn't do. A year later, they introduced a new flagship, the OM-D E-M1 Mark II, with a bunch of new features. Not long after, they put out an update that added some of those new features \\u2014 those that would reasonably work \\u2014 for my E-M5 Mark II.   Canon, on the other hand, intentionally crippled their lower-end models to drive higher-end sales. And perhaps, in a different way, they also kind of decided, for the photographer, various limits of the camera that were not necessarily natural. Their old behavior was to cripple a bunch of things. So I had a Canon 60D and added a 6D. The 60D, a much lower cost camera, had a far, far better autofocus system. They could have put something at least that good into the 6D for very little extra money, but they were more concerned about the 6D/5D competition than Nikon or anyone else competing with their offerings.  This was all through the camera, including a bunch of things that were 100% software-bases, just there to crapify the 6D versus the 5D. When you're invested in any system \\u2014 camera or otherwise \\u2014 you have a vested interest. And if you're an internet writer or pundit, your first impulse is to support and defend the things your excellent brain has found to be the best. Unfortunately, as a full-time engineer and only hobby photographer, it was all too easy for me to see how that cripple hammer had been applied. And once you get involved with a company that doesn't do that, even a little bit; a company that's actually adding new high-end features to your mid-range camera, you have a hard time sticking with the old guys.  So I was really excited to see the EOS R5. Of course, since I have not used this camera, I had to give you all my ideas here rather than a real review. But also, I'm hoping this goes beyond the R5 and changes the way Canon is thinking. I knew Canon had some technology issues\\u2026 here, they've solved that a bit, but they're also leaving it up to the user how they'd like to deal with camera limitations. As a result, you have limited features not offered by anyone else.   I noticed back in 2018 how Canon was going about their EOS R business. They introduced the original EOS R as a low-cost mirrorless, relative to the EOS 5D Mark IV, that had the same sensor and, ideally, same image quality. But they crippled it a bit, to ensure it wasn't quite a pro-grade match to the 5D. And yet, that also made it cheaper.  So get inside Canon's head for a moment. The EOS R was not all that well received, but I got the idea right away. Sony was drinking Canon's milkshake as photographers and videographers started to really get the idea of mirrorless camera advantages. When they introduced the R, they introduced three different EF to RF adapters. So any old Canon shooter could buy an EOS R, a lens adapter, and pretty much pretend they had a mirrorless Canon EF camera. The key here: you could buy a Sony, buy a Metabones adapter, but you still have a Sony\\u2026 it doesn't work as fast with your EF lenses, it doesn't use your batteries, it doesn't use your speedlights. So Canon was wise: the EOS R's only purpose was to stop the bleeding.  Next thing was glass. The reason Canon and Nikon had 80\\u201390% of the pro SLR and DSLR market for 50 years was that they had huge collections of lenses. As nice as a new camera might be, if you can't get the lens you need, fuggetaboudit! And yet, Canon offered those three adapters\\u2026. no worries.  No worries unless, like Canon, you're trying to launch a new system. Nikon went there\\u2026 Nikon didn't do all that well with the Z system, despite making excellent gear. My contention was simple: you can't make a new system for new users if you're Canon or Nikon. As with the EOS R, you make a camera that's kind of a no-brainer for existing users.  But here's the thing: let's assume I still have my EOS 6D. I go and buy an EOS R, I buy the basic adapter, and I'm golden, right\\u2026 I have a mirrorless Canon EF camera. I'm good, but Canon isn't\\u2026 they'd rather me be an EOS EF user than a Sony user, but what they'd really like is for me to be an EOS R user, cemented in place. That only happens if my next lens buys are RF lenses, not EF lenses, despite the fact they can't work on my other cameras.  So Canon did another cool thing: rather than try to flesh out their RF lens line with the basic set of EF clones they'd need to sell EOS R system cameras, they made hero lenses. The first RF lenses were insanely good lenses. So were the next few. This was brilliant \\u2014 anyone buying that one EOS R body was potentially sucked in for those lenses. This was absolutely an unusual move: Canon was delivering lenses that average folks couldn't afford, but they were selling dreams to their professional user base.   So even without having an R5 in my hands, I know enough about it to know that this completes the circle. This is the pro body that everyone who flirted with EOS R \\u2014 pretty much all pros and well-heeled enthusiasts \\u2014 wanted. And more.  Canon launched the video on a DSLR thing with the Canon 5D Mark II. Okay, sure, Nikon got there a few months before with 720; video, but Canon really sold it. And I think a big part of that, early on, as Vincent Laforet's 5D Mark II short film Reverie\\u2026 anyone who used digital camera for video back then simply knew this film was impossible. But after the 5D Mark II \\u2014 half of which were sold for video use \\u2014 Canon lost steam in the DSLR-for-video market. Why? Well, heck, Canon has been one of the Big Four in camcorders\\u2026 so they built Cinema EOS, a line of much more expensive cinema cameras that used regular EF lenses. And so regular EOS product line cameras had to get the cripple hammer.. you wouldn't want someone buying a $750, $1500, or $3000 camera that fits their needs if maybe you can sell 10% of those buyers on a $10,000+ camera that does it all\\u2026. at least, that seemed to be the logic.   So now the R5 is kind of a return to the 5D Mark II\\u2026 no artificial limitations, far as I can tell. And even IBIS \\u2014 Canon's the last one to the party on that, and I'm a bit skeptical that they can match Olympus on their first try, but I've found it critical for my own shooting.

And I think they made some good decisions, and a few bad ones that may have not been choices as much as technical limitations.  Neither Canon nor Nikon were actually new to mirrorless with last August's introductions. But the R and the Z are professional formats, even if the first models are not a match for the top-of-the-line DSLRs yet. Both Canon and Nikon took on the idea that mirrorless was something less than DSLR, a step between DSLR and compact digital cameras (aka point and shoot). Nikon's 1 system used the same 1\\u2033 sensor size found in high-end P&S cameras like the Sony RX10 and RX100. But Canon put out a very compact APS-C system with their EOS M. And a funny thing happened: while Nikon's 1 system is now defunct, the EOS M is very popular, albeit not necessarily in the USA. Canon's been the #2 mirrorless brand in Japan in 2016 and 2017 (BCN rankings, second to Olympus) and looks to be taking the #1 spot for the 2018 year\\u2026 without even counting the EOS R. Canon seems to have nailed the consumer mirrorless ILC with the EOS M.  So it should be no surprise that Canon got into mirrorless on a higher level with the EOS R, but then again, it should be. Canon is slower to react to competition than just about anyone. Why this, why now? Canon feels the competition.  For most of history since maybe the 1940s or 1950s, Canon and Nikon had much of the professional market for cameras. In the 1960s, led by Nikon, they won an 80% share, and it's been pretty much 80\\u201390% ever since. Canon managed to flip the market share on Nikon by being the first to court consumers, and then by delivering the fastest speeds for pro sports shooters. But for a long time, the only 35mm, then full-frame choice for most pros was Nikon or Canon.  This last year, the whole industry sold only 11.6 million ILCs, less than half of those sold in 2013. And 2017 was actually an 8% increase from 2016. But more the point, DSLRs sold only accounted for 65% of the ILC market\\u2026 clearly, Nikon and Canon were no longer winning an 80\\u201390% share. And while Canon's mirrorless sales were up 70% in 2017, Nikon wasn't even part of that. And of course, neither was competitive with Sony, Olympus, Panasonic, or Fujifilm in higher-end mirrorless. No one knows just where the DSLR vs. mirrorless ratio settles out in the long term, but it's not going to be terribly favorable to any company only making DSLRs.  What's It For?  If you look carefully at the EOS R, like the Nikon Z's, you'll know just what it's for: the EOS R is a mirrorless body for Canon users to buy, so that they don't buy Sonys. This is the big factor. Canon users have been trying Sony A7s with adapters, and liking them. Some keep it as an accessory, but some sell their Canon gear and move to Sony. Canon needs that to stop, and their first reaction to this situation is the EOS R.  Canon's introducing one body and four lenses, two of them quite expensive, but still, that's not a full system for nearly anyone who needs a system camera. It's a start. But if you're already a Canon shooter, the R is with an adapter is going to let you try out mirrorless with all of your glass \\u2014 even EF-S lenses, but EF-M lenses are impossible \\u2014 your existing batteries and flash units, etc. It's a much simpler way to experiment with mirrorless for today's Canon shooter. If you're new to ILCs and want full-frame mirrorless, EOS R won't be a great option for at least 3\\u20135 years, depending on how quickly Canon rolls out new glass.  So you're supposed to compare the EOS R to a Sony A7 Mark III, but the closest match is actually the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV. So you're getting more or less a mirrorless 5D Mark IV with some improvements/extra features for $900 less. That's a pretty fine deal, speaking from the Canon universe. It's a bit more expensive than the A7 Mark III, but no one's more aggressive on body pricing than Sony.  I think it succeeds in its mission. If I still had my Canon system and was ready for full frame mirrorless, the EOS R is a no-brainer versus the Sony. It's not even the cost of the bodies or the minute details of the features, but the fact it's already part of my system. The cheap lens adapter is only $100, and it works perfectly. For a bit more, I could get the adapter with filter holder, simply brilliant for video work.  Video Issues  Alas, on that latter one, Canon's still being Canon, and not in a good way. They're still crippling 4K video on the EOS R, delivering the same 1.7x crop you have on the EOS 5D mark IV. If you're buying a full-frame DSLR for video, the point is to have full frame video. With that crop, you're better off going to a Panasonic GH5 or a Blackmagic Design Pocket Cinema Camera 4K, depending on your needs.  I expect for most stills work, you have a 5D Mark IV as far as the quality goes. You won't quite match Sony in very low light, but you'll have a bit more resolution in bright light, so it's probably not a big deal for most photographers. You'll have the Canon color, which Sony has yet to match, and the Canon menus you're used to\\u2026 well, maybe. They have a few new controls on the camera, which changes around the way its used. There's a programmable ring control on lenses, but you won't run into that with adapted EF lenses unless you get the third adapter, the one with the ring control. There's also a touch strip on the back, which most reviewers aren't yet crazy about.  Neither Sony nor Canon has 10-bit in-camera video, which is what you need for serious Log shooting. But the EOS R does have that as an external option, at least. I'd bet on Sony's A7S Mark III offering 10-bit in some fashion, but like Canon, Sony's got their own cinema camera business they feel compelled to protect by crippling the mirrorless models. Oddly, though, Nikon opted for the same thing, in-camera 8-bit, external 10-bit, even without a video market to protect. I guess that leaves them both with a feature to add to a higher end model, next year. Or save money and buy the GH5 right now.  Conclusions  So basically, I think the EOS R is attractive to anyone with a full Canon system thinking about mirrorless. If Canon's annoying behaviors haven't driven you away yet, this may well be your mirrorless. I don't really find any huge problems with it. Knowing that Sony was the initial target, nothing about the EOS R or the Nikon Zs were particularly unexpected. Both aim for the Sony's, Nikon at both the A7III and the A7RIII, Canon's basically doing the A7III competitor now. I would hope they're holding off an A7RIII competitor until they have some improved sensor tech, probably also going into the EOS 5DS Mark II."}, {"upvote": 19, "content": "EOS (Electro Optical System) is just a marketing name for Canon's auto focusing. It essentially means nothing any more, as all cameras have decent focusing, and 'EOS' is no guarantee of a better focusing system (some people may quibble this, but the EOS system changes per model so is no longer even a standard).  The number of focusing sensors, their distribution and type, and whether the particular model is aimed at the beginner, intermediate or pro are all better indicators.  Ignore 'EOS', PDAF , 'TTL', 'SLT', back-lit' and all the other acronyms and key words to do with internal operation, and look at actual product reviews.  The only terms you should consider is the difference between 'DSLR' and 'Advanced compact' as the latter is now almost as good as the former for entry level, and far cheaper for the beginner (you don't need to pay out for quality fast glass) whilst allowing you to do everything you can with a DSLR. The terms \\u2018DSLR' and \\u2018mirrorless' may also matter (DSLRs tend to focus faster, although the most recent mirrorless cameras are changing this because computer processing now allows finer focus control via features such as eye-autofocus).  Here's one big thing to remember; For a still subject in good light, you cannot tell the difference between a photo taken with a $500 camera and a $3000 one. The reasons for buying the $3000 camera are to do with the subject not being still and the light not being good, and nothing else.  Just look at each camera as a self standing device compared against results vs price vs what you need. If you are set on a Pro model, buy second hand; a Canon 5D Mk 1 is as cheap as a modern entry level DSLR, and will fast-track you to pro, because you have a pro model to start with!  More importantly, look to the photo galleries (flickr etc) to see what real people are producing with the camera. (each camera has its own gallery, as does each lens); that is your best indicator by far.

Not only is the 1D X around $6,000 (body-only), but you're going to need expensive CFast cards for 4K video, and the 4K video on the thing is in gigantic Motion JPEG files, and not all that amazing anyway. If I wanted a 4K camera for video, I'd recommend either get a Panasonic GH4 or perhaps a Sony A7s mark II.  The Nikon D80 (2006) and the D3 (2007) are ancient models and don't shoot video. The D3s does shoot video, but only 720p, not full HD.  The EOS 7D (2009) is also fairly old. It can shoot 720p or 1080p video, but only 12 minutes at a time. The others here can shoot 29\\u203259\\u2033 without stopping \\u2014 that's a limit set to avoid paying a European camcorder tax. While it doesn't apply at all in the USA, most camera manufacturers (other than Panasonic, far as I know) impose this limit even on North American and Japanese models.  The Nikon D5300 isn't a bad choice for video. It's a few models old, it came out in 2003, the current model is the D5600, so it's may be available for a value price. But this line is a consumer line, APS-C sensor, and not terribly expensive. It can shoot video at 1080p up to 60fps\\u2026 not something you'd need for vlogging, but you want 60p for sports or other action video. Another advantage for vlogging, the D5300 has built-in WiFi, so it can be controlled wirelessly via an app. Most Canon and Nikon can be tethered via USB for remote control, and some have add-on controls, but it's handy to have it built-in.  I have the EOS 6D, and it produces amazing video, particularly in low light, where it blows away my far more expensive dedicated camcorders. The 6D right now is a good bargain, but mostly because everyone expects Canon to announce the 6D mark II Real Soon Now. The 6D also has built-in WiFi.  The EOS 5D mark III is the upgrade of Canon's breakthrough EOS 5D mark II. It's a great camera, one of the go-to standards for video-on-stills camera shooting. But while it's a solid choice if you can afford it, it's not the best choice. For one, it's been superceeded by the EOS 5D mark IV, if you're looking for a higher end model that shoots great video.  Of those on your list, the Canon EOS 80D would be my choice for anyone wanting a strong video option. Like the Nikon, it can shoot a variety of modes up to 1080p60. But the real advantage is in the sensor. This is Canon's second-generation mid-range DSLR with what they call a Dual Pixel sensor. This sensor splits each pixel into two separate photodiodes. Based on the way they're masked, each sensor pair works like a phase-detect autofocus sensor. So unlike every other DSLR on your list, the 80D can give you full performance autofocus in video, and things you usually just find on camcorders and mirrorless cameras, like follow-focus in video, etc. Dual Pixel is also used on Canon's 5D mark IV and all the new Cinema EOS video cameras. And the 80D also has built-in WiFi.  Far as the larger idea of a full camera system goes, you can't really go wrong with either Canon or Nikon. They have the two most complete lines of cameras and two most complete collection of lenses. However, neither offers a mirrorless option. So that means you're only shooting video from the back screen, not the viewfinder. And that only the 80D on your list has fully function video autofocus\\u2026 the others will AF in video, but it's on demand, not continuous, and it's often not very good. The phase detect sensors that DSLRs use are not available with the mirror up, which is what you have in video mode.  For one-person vlogging, keep in mind you are going to want to see yourself, which means either an add-on monitor while shooting or an articulated screen. The 80D and the D5300 both have fully articulated screens which let you see what you're recording from the front of the camera. The others do not, and will absolutely require an external monitor for vlogging."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "NOT buying the Canon EOS R5, and here's why:  I have tens of thousands of dollars invested in my current system, all based on Nikon cameras and lenses. I simply can't justify \\u2018jumping ship' to a different camera or system despite the power and quality of the R5.  That is likely the overriding reason why MANY veteran photographers won't consider the Canon R5, because it's just not the camera that matters, it's everything else that fits in the camera manufacturer's ecosystem. As good as the Canon R5 may be, it can't hold a candle to my Nikon gear unless and until I am willing to add a similar collection of Canon lenses to the equation. Even at that, there are certain features and aspects of Nikon cameras/images/equipment etc. that I have learned to prefer over anything else out there.  A photographer with a sizeable investment in Sony, Fuji, or Panasonic gear is likely to have the same point of view, preferring to stay with what they know, love, and already own, than go through the process of ramping up another system.  Other factors are at play too:   * I've been buying cameras long enough to know that the major manufacturers play a constant game of leapfrog, each in turn introducing \\u2018breakthrough advances' that the other manufacturers eventually adopt, adapt, and add. It's really only a matter of time until everything that puts the R5 head-and-shoulders above the current competition is available on other manufacturers' models. (Think in-body stabilization, for example.) And, it's only a matter of time before someone else comes out with something that makes the R5 (or any other breakthrough camera) look out of date.  * Even now, Nikon is teasing its customers with the imminent release of the Z 6II and Z 7II, which both boast big improvements in video, focusing, frame rate, dynamic range, and processing power. It's enough of an upgrade to cause most Nikon shooters who might be considering a switch (to Canon or Sony) to have second thoughts. Canon, Sony, all of them do something similar, rolling out incremental improvements that make it far tougher for their current owners to abandon their current brand.  * The system a serious photographer chooses goes so deep that it becomes scary to even think about the big switch. It's not just bodies and lenses. It can include memory cards, card readers, batteries, extension tubes, teleconverters, filters, cables, flashes, flash triggers, even Photoshop/Lightroom presets!  * Whenever the unending battle over features rears its head, I try to remember that the weakest link in my photo system isn't any shortcoming in the camera, lenses, or associated gear. The weakest link is me. I'm the one who makes most of the mistakes, compromises, shortcuts, and misjudgements that impact the images I ask the camera system to create.

I have not heard any mention, one way or another, of this in the leaks or the small bits of cookie Canon's tossed out to feed the press.  And yes, of course, a lens is anamorphic, not a camera. But cameras can directly support anamorphic lenses. The most important is supporting a full sensor recording mode without any cropping. It makes little sense to record in a 16:9 aspect ratio with an anamorphic lens, unless maybe you're shooting video to fill an ultra wide screen gaming monitor for some reason. The Panasonic GH5 has a full 4:3 anamorphic mode, for example. The camera delivers a full sensor's worth of capture, while your lens determines the unsqueezed aspect ratio.  The other possible feature is for the camera to offer an unsqueezed viewfinder mode in conjunction. This, of course, requires the ability to dial in you lens aspect ratio.

The second bit is how much money have you got as the likes of a Canon 1-DX or a 5-D mark whatever will cost you maybe between six grand and twenty grand depending on which lens you want to play with.  As you never mentioned what you are trying to do or photograph in this so called low Light situation then one cannot be more specific and also with reference to using High ISO and this is a lot of bullshit as in many cases ISO of about 1600 is high enough for most situations. I do often wonder what all this reference to Low Light photography is all about as I use an Olympus for night street work in all sorts of lighting situations and it works out fine for me yet the Guru's will tell anyone who will listen that Olympus does not handle Low Light but it seems to work OK for me.  If the Auto-focus cannot find anything to focus on then I can switch to Manual Focus and use Focus Peaking assist and that works fine as well. Then there is the issue of using a wide open Aperture of like f-1.8 or f-2.0 and this gives an in focus depth of field of about six inches at a distance of around ten feet between the subject and the camera and so there is that.  If you are wandering around in the dark looking to photograph something then there is also the issue of Mixed Lighting which can give the white balance a strange cast of blue or orange depending on which lighting source is close by but as you already know If you shoot in RAW then you can set the white balance in post production and so that is not an issue.  However to answer your question and so the new yet to be released Canon I-DX Mark whatever it is is the flagship Canon model and may well cost around the Eight Grand price tag Plus the lenses and so basically upward of ten grand one could say with a couple of nice white L series lenses. or you can buy a Canon Rebel for $400.00 and put a Nifty Fifty prime lens on it for another hundred bucks and so it is up to you."}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-eo-ipso-and-ipso-facto", "question": "What is the difference between eo ipso and ipso facto", "answers": [{"upvote": 0, "content": "\\u2018Ipso' means \\u2018itself', ablative case. \\u2018Eo' is just \\u2018it' (the third-person-singular neuter pronoun) and \\u2018facto' is the past participle of \\u2018facere', to do or make; all ablative.

Do not get this line of thinking stuck in your head because it's not entirely true. In fact, to be honest, this statement is used many times by people who simply can't afford good gear and are jealous at those who can. If you can't afford good gear right now, that's fine; work with what you can afford and save up money to grow into better gear over time. The best camera is always the one you have with you and by this I mean, if you own a $6,500 Canon 1DX and it's sitting at home, your best camera may be the free one that came built into the phone in your pocket!  While it is true, skill is the most important aspect of almost anything, including photography, your gear and even more specifically, your lenses, are just as important. A good lens on an inexpensive camera is always better than a cheap lens on an expensive camera. If you're just starting out and looking for a camera for a beginner, try to think about what sort of photography you'll be doing. General photography such as family photos, photos of your friends, pets, etc.; landscape photography; wildlife photography; street photography, etc. If you don't know yet, that's okay but if you have a goal of developing skills specific to one of these styles, it will help with camera selection.  When getting started, I'd get something inexpensive but not so cheap that your photo quality ends up discouraging you altogether (again, this is where the \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" nonsense kicks in.) I'll cover a couple types and why they're good starter cameras. And with any camera you choose, always try to keep the camera out of \\\"automatic mode\\\" if possible so you begin to master the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  Point-and-Shoot or Camera Phone  These cameras are very inexpensive and with the newer smartphones, the camera is built right in and often takes better photos than the DSLR's from just a few years ago! This is the most inexpensive route to take (and may not cost a penny if you use the camera on your phone) and it helps you learn about composition, lighting, etc. If you're already past this point and want a camera you can grow into, the following are good options:  Traditional SLR's  I know, this is probably not what most people think of when deciding on a beginner's camera but I want to mention it because if you have one of these lying around in your house (parent's or grandparent's old camera, etc.), they're great for learning the basics of a camera with all of the digital stuff removed. SLR (single lens reflex) cameras aren't used much anymore because of the cost of operation, decreased photo quality, and lack of film processing labs, however, I think any aspiring photographer should own or at least use one because they are the \\\"original camera\\\", they are inexpensive, and they help give you a greater appreciation for the luxury of digital photography (not limited to 24-36 photos per roll, immediate results where you can see your photo seconds after taking it, easy and fast multiple frame shooting, and no cost by ruining a roll of film or wasting it on bad photos.) If you buy a traditional SLR 35mm camera, I'd go for something like the Nikon 35mm F2AS with a 50mm \\\"prime lens\\\", or similar. Here's a photo of one of mine:  Digital SLR's  Digital SLR's, or DSLR's, have been the most popular choice for many years now, they're easy to find used, and they're a good starting point in learning photography. These cameras are basically digital versions of the original SLR camera but offer much more flexibility and many more options. Whagt we're seeing right now, however, is a switch from DSLR's to \\\"mirrorless cameras\\\", including the very popular \\\"Micro Four Thirds\\\" cameras which use a smaller sensor, yet often outperform the DSLR's. I'll touch on those, below. Anyway, an inexpensive or used DSLR is a good choice for starting out and I'd recommend an entry level Canon DSLR such as one of the \\\"Rebel\\\" series cameras. I currently use a Canon 1DX which is NOT a beginner's camera, and my old Canon 5D Mark II (this is a great beginner's camera, easy to find, and inexpensive.) Here's a photo of the Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm prime lens attached:  Mirrorless Cameras  These cameras really are \\\"the future of photography\\\" although many professional photographers would scoff at you for even suggesting such a thing because just as it was when SLR's were phasing out, DSLR using pro's often get stuck in their ways and refuse to move with the times. Even today there are professional photographers who refuse to switch from SLR to DSLR! Mirrorless cameras are superior to DSLR's in almost every way: They have higher resolution (megapixels) for a fraction of the cost of DSLR's; there's no mirror flapping around making noise and causing camera vibration; they're smaller and easier to carry, many can shoot 4K and even Cinema 4K video (while Canon and Nikon refuse to adapt and offer this feature for a reasonable price in their DSLR's); and overall, they're less expensive. If you can afford one (they're often cheaper than many new DSLR's), go for it! I currently shoot with a Panasonic Lumix GH4 because I shoot photography AND I need to shoot 4K video and this camera does both. An even less expensive alternative is the Lumix GH3 which sells for around $500, a quarter of the price of the GH4. Here's a photo of the Lumix GH4, a \\\"mirrorless camera\\\":  Regardless of what you choose, unless it's a cheap $30 point-and-shoot or your phone's camera, try to make a decision on which camera format you want to grow into, otherwise you'll be wasting money on a camera and the expensive lenses that you'll end up not using when you switch to a different format.  Taking an introductory photography class or workshop is also a good idea when getting started as you'll more quickly learn the basics including aperture, exposure, shutter speed, composition, and editing.

You cannot get a specific answer with a generic question. I have just bought a 6D Mark II. I have had the original 6D for nearly three years. I shoot live music in mostly small, badly lit venues. When I bought the 6D it was Canon's best low-light camera (even better than the 5D MkII and 1DX). It was also very affordable for someone who makes very little money working in a sector with very little money. It was an upgrade from a 550D (APS-C). I had one EF-S lens for that camera \\u2013 a Tamron 17\\u201350 f/2.8 that was my go to lens. My 70\\u2013200 f/2.8 was an EF. When I upgraded, I bought a used Canon 24\\u201370 f/2.8, and a friend sold me his 16\\u201335mm f/2.8 at a bargain price. I now had a full range of full-frame lenses that I needed for the 6D. That camera has now taken close 30k photos, but no video, so I was feeling the need to get a new body (as in camera, although the physical one could do with an upgrade too) when the EOS-R was announced. Personally, I'm not overly convinced about the hype over mirrorless cameras (I do have an EOS M2 as a pocket camera), probably because I have been using an SLR since the 1970s and they have never failed, and I mostly see mirrorless as a marketing ploy to sell more gear.  I looked at the same options you have asked about and asked myself if I wanted to use a body almost identical to the one I was currently familiar with, but upgraded, or go for a new technology with a new lens mount. I then looked at my bank account and prices of the two options. I found a new 6D MkII and battery grip for under \\u00a31100. It was not a difficult decision at that point. A new camera body that would use all my existing lenses without needing an adaptor, and without the need to familiarise myself with a new body and way of working, as well as using a new system in its first iteration that would need regular firmware updates. During my next upgrade cycle I may opt for the EOS-R as all the bugs will have been sorted, and my lenses will probably need upgrading as well by then.  So, as you can see, there is no definitive answer. My advice is to never buy a camera purely from the spec sheets, or people's reviews either. You need to actually hold them in your hands and use them in the situation you intend to use them most. Don't buy a camera that is over-specced for what you are shooting. For example, do you really need a full-frame camera? If you mostly want to shoot video, would an actual video camera serve you better? And always look at your budget, and don't spend more than you need to, especially if it's a hobby.

If you're asking about 50mm as a field of view (FOV) in full-frame terms, then yes it's good. So long as you're shooting the equivalent on smaller formats you'll be okay.  A 50mm lens for street photography will have a different effective FOV depending on your camera and sensor/medium.  Remember: if you're shooting a micro four thirds camera you'll want a 25mm lens; APS-C cameras like Nikon DX, Fuji X series, Sony a6000 series cameras need a 35mm lens; medium format 6x6 cameras like Hasselblads and Rolleiflex TLRs with an 80mm lens will equate to a 50mm FOV.  The 50mm FOV is not bad by any means but it is going to be a rather tight in terms of framing if you're working up close or want to provide your subject(s) with the proper context. Again, it depends on how you're shooting and the typical distance(s) you work with.  A lot of street photography purists will say stick to 35mm or wider because, the closer you are, the better the photograph, but the problem with this is a FOV, and the lens you shoot, is a conscious choice that you are making as the photographer. No one method, lens, FOV or style is going to work for everyone.  Honestly the best way for you to find out whether a FOV or lens is well-suited to street photography is to go out and shoot, shoot, shoot. The time you spend out and about making photographs is more important than your choice of lens or FOV.  Eventually you'll settle on one or two focal lengths that just mesh with your style of shooting. By then you should no longer be worrying about whether this lens or this FOV is \\u2018good' or not.  Me personally, I find 50mm very versatile for my style of street photography. I like to photograph and show the relationships humans have within their environment.

A better question to ask would be what LENS would be best for portrait photography - because that is where the real quality difference is.

So, I would go for either:   * 50mm f1.8 which costs around USD 200  * A zoom lens that includes that focal length, that will give you weaker performance in low light, but more flexibility. For best quality, I would look for a zoom with smaller range but biggest possible aperture. The best you can afford. Can't recommend specific model - as that will depend on the brand and your budget.

The RMS current is amps, but the square root of a current is sqrt(amps). You cannot compare them.  If the current is DC, then the RMS and maximum currents are the same.  If the current is a pure sine wave, then the RMS current is 0.707 of the maximum current.  Other wave forms have different ratios.  But what is RMS really? It is the current that a DC supply would have that is delivering the same power to the load.  RMS means root mean square, which means that if you have a current i(t), then you square it (i(t))^2, then average that (mean) then take the square root of the average. (For continuous functions, averaging is done by taking the definite integral over a multiple of the period, then dividing by the time.)  Why does that work? Because power is I^2 * R. The instantaneous power in a resistive load is (i(t))^2 R.

You will get concerning Photography topic there!"}, {"upvote": 12, "content": "Thanks for the A2A. While this question is quite old (from 2012), it is certainly a perennial that deserves a useful answer.  Let's first review the needs. With regard to budget, in 2012 the K20D had been on the market for several years at a price of about $700 USD with a kit zoom lens. So let's use that as your budget. It is a well built, relatively compact, APS-C format DSLR. It would be a good walk-around DSLR.  Landscape photography is a broad genre. The landscape cliche is large wide-angle perspectives with strong foreground elements, deep depth of field, high dynamic range that may include deep shadows and bright sun in the same frame, and high resolution. Ansel Adams defined the genre with classic images such as this one of the Tetons in Wyoming, USA \\u2026  While it's tempting to focus on the sensor resolution requirements for photos like this, in this budget range the bigger challenges is finding the quality of lens necessary to capture the detail, and a camera sensor with the dynamic range to capture the full range of tones in the image.  Let's look at the measured dynamic range for several models in roughly this price range (data from DXOMark) \\u2026   * Nikon D5500: 14 EV  * Sony A6300: 13.7 EV  * Canon EOS M3: 11.8 EV  * Olympus EM-10 Mk ii: 12.5 EV  * Panasonic GX-80: 12.8 EV On this basis you can see Nikon and Sony do have about a 1 EV advantage in terms of dynamic range. Larger full frame formats would be even better for this application but are outside of the budget. The best of the smaller 1\\u2033 sensor cameras, like the Sony RX100 IV, have DR's in the range of 12.6. While that's an amazing number for a such a compact camera, your question didn't say anything about keeping the camera especially light and compact.  Now let's consider lens choice. The speed of the lens isn't critical for classical landscape photography. More important factors are sharpness and angle of view. The Nikon kit lens for the D5500 \\u2014 the 18\\u201355/3.5\\u20135.6 VR II \\u2014 is not especially sharp over the range of focal lengths and f/numbers you would be using for landscape work. (See here for details Nikon AF-S DX Nikkor 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR mounted on Nikon D5300 : Measurements | DxOMark) [ http://www.dxomark.com/Lenses/Nikon/AF-S-DX-Nikkor-18-55mm-f-3.5-5.6G-VR-mounted-on-Nikon-D5300---Measurements__919 ]. Unfortunately, the Sony kit lens, the 16\\u201350/3.5\\u20135.6 \\u2014 is worse.  Improving the lens requires additional expenditure. The Rokinon 14/2.8, for example, would provide a much sharper image with an even wider perspective the kit zoom for about $400 USD. It's a manual focus, but that's not such a problem for wide-angle landscape work.  The final point is that landscape photography benefits from the use of tripods, neutral density filters, graduated ND filters, and polarizers. These accessories are key to many of the great shots you see in magazines and various galleries. Quality accessories are not cheap, and cheap accessories end up having to be replaced once you discover their shortcomings. Just recognize that these are additional expenses to consider.  So on this basis, in my view the best landscape interchangeable lens camera in this price range is the D5500 with kit lens, with a possible second lens suited to your needs and interests, and with the accessories you need to complete your landscape kit.  If all of that goes substantially over budget, then you might consider a used camera in the same price range, and lenses and accessories as budget permits. Then, at a later time, you could upgrade the camera body and reuse the quality accessories you purchased in the meanwhile.  Hope that helps."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "Camera and lens are both important. Larger sensor and higher resolution are preferred. The best though?

Also there are many older DSLRs to consider that are still fine cameras in 2015, but that are second-hand bargains now.

Choosing an SLR is not simply a matter of choosing the \\\"best\\\" body, and changing systems (because you made the \\\"wrong\\\": choice initially) is just time and effort down the drain that could be better used in some other way.  If you start out knowing the largest size you will ever print, and with some knowledge of how much you often have to crop an image to realise your vision, then you can make a good estimate of how many Mp you need in your sensor.    If you are planning to shoot in heavy rain, salt water spray, dust, or extreme heat or cold you'll need to think about how tough and weather-proof your equipment needs to be.  If you will be walking a long way (e.g. back-packing), then weight is a consideration.  You may primarily be interested in landscapes, but if you also plan to shoot other subjects (e.g. sport, wild-life) then things like frame rate, buffer depth, AF speed and low-light ability start to matter.  If it is ultimate technical quality you are after then larger formats beat the best current 35mm format DSLRs, and probably always will, if they use equally advanced technology.  But if you are looking at something like a Pentax 35mm-style DSLR then medium format probably does not meet your overall needs.

Not only is the 1D X around $6,000 (body-only), but you're going to need expensive CFast cards for 4K video, and the 4K video on the thing is in gigantic Motion JPEG files, and not all that amazing anyway. If I wanted a 4K camera for video, I'd recommend either get a Panasonic GH4 or perhaps a Sony A7s mark II.  The Nikon D80 (2006) and the D3 (2007) are ancient models and don't shoot video. The D3s does shoot video, but only 720p, not full HD.  The EOS 7D (2009) is also fairly old. It can shoot 720p or 1080p video, but only 12 minutes at a time. The others here can shoot 29\\u203259\\u2033 without stopping \\u2014 that's a limit set to avoid paying a European camcorder tax. While it doesn't apply at all in the USA, most camera manufacturers (other than Panasonic, far as I know) impose this limit even on North American and Japanese models.  The Nikon D5300 isn't a bad choice for video. It's a few models old, it came out in 2003, the current model is the D5600, so it's may be available for a value price. But this line is a consumer line, APS-C sensor, and not terribly expensive. It can shoot video at 1080p up to 60fps\\u2026 not something you'd need for vlogging, but you want 60p for sports or other action video. Another advantage for vlogging, the D5300 has built-in WiFi, so it can be controlled wirelessly via an app. Most Canon and Nikon can be tethered via USB for remote control, and some have add-on controls, but it's handy to have it built-in.  I have the EOS 6D, and it produces amazing video, particularly in low light, where it blows away my far more expensive dedicated camcorders. The 6D right now is a good bargain, but mostly because everyone expects Canon to announce the 6D mark II Real Soon Now. The 6D also has built-in WiFi.  The EOS 5D mark III is the upgrade of Canon's breakthrough EOS 5D mark II. It's a great camera, one of the go-to standards for video-on-stills camera shooting. But while it's a solid choice if you can afford it, it's not the best choice. For one, it's been superceeded by the EOS 5D mark IV, if you're looking for a higher end model that shoots great video.  Of those on your list, the Canon EOS 80D would be my choice for anyone wanting a strong video option. Like the Nikon, it can shoot a variety of modes up to 1080p60. But the real advantage is in the sensor. This is Canon's second-generation mid-range DSLR with what they call a Dual Pixel sensor. This sensor splits each pixel into two separate photodiodes. Based on the way they're masked, each sensor pair works like a phase-detect autofocus sensor. So unlike every other DSLR on your list, the 80D can give you full performance autofocus in video, and things you usually just find on camcorders and mirrorless cameras, like follow-focus in video, etc. Dual Pixel is also used on Canon's 5D mark IV and all the new Cinema EOS video cameras. And the 80D also has built-in WiFi.  Far as the larger idea of a full camera system goes, you can't really go wrong with either Canon or Nikon. They have the two most complete lines of cameras and two most complete collection of lenses. However, neither offers a mirrorless option. So that means you're only shooting video from the back screen, not the viewfinder. And that only the 80D on your list has fully function video autofocus\\u2026 the others will AF in video, but it's on demand, not continuous, and it's often not very good. The phase detect sensors that DSLRs use are not available with the mirror up, which is what you have in video mode.  For one-person vlogging, keep in mind you are going to want to see yourself, which means either an add-on monitor while shooting or an articulated screen. The 80D and the D5300 both have fully articulated screens which let you see what you're recording from the front of the camera. The others do not, and will absolutely require an external monitor for vlogging."}, {"upvote": 2, "content": "If you consider specifically DSLR, they are not waterproof.  But!!!

What was suggested if by chance the camera got submerged in water is that, don't try to dry it yourself or try to switch on, otherwise it can cause permanent damage. What you should do is that let the camera submerged in water, and rush to the nearest service centre describing the situation. Even if you are taking the camera to the shop, let it submerged in water bucket or something, do not let it dry. After handing over to the service centre they will take care of device.

Before I start the assertions, they are a few things that I want to debunk before I get comments claiming that I was biased or something like that.    %3E Debunk A: Narratively speaking, Kuvira is the strongest villain as she is the last main villain in the overall series. If I'm being honest, this gotta be the shittest claim I've heard tbh. The ATLA verse isn't based on narrative scalings unless they are pure statements of someone being the pinnacle of something, like the avatar being the strongest or Toph being narrative seen to be the strongest earthbender. It's not only narratively supported with the fact that Toph is the greatest earthbender though, as she consistently boasts about it and is written by Bryke to be the strongest.  Just trying to state that the new-gen %3E previous-gen solely based on narrative purposes is just ass\\u2026 very much so. While I did say I had a few things to debunk that were actually the only one, it's far too narratively inconsistent by feats, statements, and retcons throughout the series to keep on thinking that a single narrative argument can back up your claims.    %3E Kuvira's assertion B4 Kuvira actually has some good feats, as she had been shown to overpower base PTSD Korra who still had great control over the 4 elements, while suppressed.  Even though she was originally overpowering her, she got absolutely slammed by AS Korra (PTSD\\u2014nerf) and would've died if it weren't for the poison kicking in.  During Bryan and Mike's Q&A, they said that Toph (presumably Old Toph as this refers to B4 where Kuvira is the villain) would at least give a good fight for Kuvira under the premise that Kuvira herself would win.  For now, take the statement however you want, whether or so you want to believe that this implies all versions of Toph %3C Kuvira. Kuvira was also blatantly seen to be superior to everyone on the new Team Avatar (beside Korra), as Kuvira overpowering her base state should be seen as a better feat than what they have accomplished.    %3E Bumi's affirmation Old Bumi is the only variant that has feats and not pure hype, I'll be using him. Bumi has been shown to be the 2nd strongest Lotus member (based on showings), as he was seen in the comics to stalemate 14 yr Toph, who was proclaimed to be the greatest earthbender at this age.  Prior to this and during the eclipse, Bumi was shown chucking and tossing buildings that were more or less the size of an average building in Republic City.  So this basically means that this feat that Bumi performed was %3E to Lin, Suyin, Bolin, and other metal benders cutting down a building via earthbending.  And if you're wondering why this is relevant, is due to Suyin being able to stalemate Kuvira for a while (this was prime Kuvira, she didn't get stronger at all after this matchup, and remained the same in the final fight against Korra. Korra never used AS in the final fight, as it would have been an astronomical stomp.)   %3E Conclusion So by feats & what we've seen and what's been stated throughout the series, Bumi should take the W and narrative arguments can't be used in Kuvira's scaling as she isn't an Avatar/spirit or has been stated to be capable of doing something incapable of any previous bender (besides using a mecha).

Over the past few months, the TLOK downplay has become so immense that some believe that B3 Zuko would defeat someone like DAS Unalaq regardless of everything dictating otherwise. Some are just creating fallacious arguments which just factor things that don't matter in a battle that's a complete stop so I've decided to give an answer providing evidence to support my argument of Kuvira %3E EoS Toph.   %3E Section #1: Narrative standpoint/Author statement Without even demonstrating feats, it has been established early on that villains progressively become stronger throughout the series. As Korra has gained strength, the villains need to match a level where they can oppose the protagonist in both power and status which allows them to retain an equal standing.  Throughout the narrative, it has been pretty evident that Kuvira was at the pinnacle of earth benders demonstrated through her bouts against Korra and her being capable of preventing retaliation amongst those who disagree with her judgment.  In an interview with the authors (Bryan & Mike), it is directly stated that Kuvira is a master of her elements and Toph would be able to give her a good fight against her, diminishing the false hype of Toph obliterating Kuvira.   %3E Section #2: Kuvira's combat prowess As they were two fights between the two, it only seems appropriate to address them as separate matters, while still keeping in mind that her earthbending is at the top of the top, and scaling should be understood as: Kuvira %3E~ Toph or Kuvira ~ Toph.   * [1] Kuvira vs Korra fight Since it seems like a good idea to bring out Kuvira's greatest feats, it should be noted of her superiority to a weakened Korra while she was toying with her. Kuvira abruptly established her strength against Korra, leaving me to conclude that Kuvira as of this fight is %3E.   * [2] Kuvira vs Korra fight At this point, Kuvira is at best relative to base Korra, being shown to deal damage while also reacting to her attacks. This all changes when Korra uses AS which instantly put her above Kuvira. This allows me to assert that Korra is superior to Kuvira, making it Korra %3E Kuvira.   %3E Section #4: Toph It's necessary for me to establish where Toph scales to make this answer unbiased and somewhat educated for readers. I've been able to find a great deal of evidence that can make EoS Toph near the pinnacle of earthbending (or possibly on it).  Toph is repeatedly stated by herself and others to be the greatest earthbender having backed it up with her mastery of earthbending and the creation of metal bending & seismic senses. However, her claiming herself to be the greatest at such an age can't be validated over a few decades later were even the amateur benders are capable of metal bending and the evolution of different forms of bending styles. Even when you look at it from another perspective, it's quite contradictory due to Kuvira demonstrating feats tiers above anything performed by Toph that led to her bold claim over being the greatest.  Kuvira has shown a plentiful amount of feats that make her the better earthbender as well as the skill gap being very, very large. Even with Toph's seismic senses, Kuvira's speed feats have been at the best of the best, compared to even the likes of Prime Toph.   The narrative of Kuvira being the last villain of TLOK already makes her at the best of benders due to her needing to be at a certain level to actually fight the Avatar, which she has performed through her bouts. Kid Toph just gets mauled, especially when her best feats were just barely keeping up with B2 base Aang who is overall inferior to base B4 Korra."}, {"upvote": 14, "content": "So let's see who we have here  Geras  Gaara  Let's see there SKILLS  Geras  1.

EOS Ichigo probably still negs Kenpachi  I'll explain why, but before that\\u2026  Normally I would plug my servers but since a certain someone (Cough cough, Hanzo cough cough) always joins the Pure Boo server (Maybe from my links).  I'll only promote the Bleach scans server that we're working on.  https://discord.gg/TUMMcvpHbR And the KSI server too  https://discord.gg/8vAFUtSFQK So onto the answer LMAO.   Before I make this answer, I want to address something.  Ichigo did indeed get his powers back or at the very least his Quincy powers.  Not only that but Ichigo in TYBW got his Zanpakuto basically restored by Tsukushima.  Now, if you pay attention to the first scan for a bit.  He basically made a completely different and alternate past where Ichigo's Zangetsu was never destroyed, think about it like this.  Let's say there's a past, a past that can't change, or anything like that because it already happened, and in front of the past is an infinite amount of possibilities, and as Yhwach states, the future to him appears like sand.  As he states, he can just pluck one grain of sand and change that, so because of that, ALL of those future timelines have been affected by Yhwach, and in basically every since one of them, he's destroy Zangetsu.  So what Tsukushima does, is create an alternate past, where Zangetsu was never destroyed, basically making new infinite timelines that Yhwach has never affected yet.  Basically all of this allows Orihime to revert the sword back to it's original form.   Now to ACTUALLY get onto the answer.  Due to all of this, we can say that EOS Ichigo most likely wins.  He was low end relative to a Yhwach as he was able to harm EOS Ichigo in the fight  Not only that but in the fight, he was able to severely harm Yhwach too  Not only that but Yhwach himself compliments Ichigo  And in fact, he even broke Ichigo's Zangetsu because it might have been overpowered.  Kenpachi is strong in his own right, he's stated to basically be the strongest Soul Reaper  (Won't beat Ichigo but).  Still though, Kenpachi has some good feats, but EOS Ichigo was able to fight Yhwach and be lower end relative to him.  I don't see any way for Kenpachi to win.   So imo, EOS Ichigo wins.  Hope you enjoyed the answer"}, {"upvote": 3, "content": "It's kind of difficult to answer without actually getting into what you want really. Will try to give a generalised answer.  General Acceptance: Ethereum better known for its market capitalisation. Means they have more money in circulation. The only coin that beats Ethereum is Bitcoin in this regard. ETH also more well known than EOS. i.e., more places you can trade especially decentralized exchanges. Ethereum also has better wallet support.  Developer Support: Ethereum's developer community is larger than EOS's. There's a vast array of developers available if one wants to develop a dApp. However, the EOS block producers and block producer candidates are (indirectly) incentivized to help the dev community by providing support, tools and sometimes funding. The amount of support for EOS currently is phenomenal.  Smart Contracts: Solidity, the smart contract language for Ethereum is very close to Javscript and is purpose built for smartcontracts. With the Python version [ https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/v0.1.0-beta.10/ ] is out, it will be easier to code. EOS supports Webassembly smartcontracts usually written on C++. Technically you can write the code in any language which can compile into WASM though. There are IDEs [ https://www.eosstudio.io/ ] to help. If you are just starting to code contracts, you would be better off with EOS in my opinion.  Scalability: ETH's blocks are produced in ~15 seconds. EOS block time is ~500milli seconds. If you are developing an app for a consumer, you may find EOS closer fit for real-world scenarios. For a better comparison, EOS supports around 1000 TPS (transactions per second) while ETH is at 15TPS. Currently EOS accounts for 68% [ https://www.blocktivity.info/ ] of the blockchain transactions while ETH has 3%. Please note that this is just a comparison. Why EOS has such a massive share has probably much to do with how transactions are designed in EOS.  Cost: dApps built on ethereum need to spend ETH as Ethereum is proof of work currently. The price volatality of ETH stops one from spending it. The cost of transaction in EOS is adjusted by their inflation model. EOS do not charge a transaction fee. It's closer to how our current internet works. So users will be more inclined to use an EOS dApp in the long run as it is cheaper or free. We are currently starting to see this is the case.  Price stability: EOS/USD price is comparatively stable compared to BTC/USD or ETH/USD. Currently BTC is bullish and many alt coins followed suit while EOS is still $5-$8 rages.  EOS's design is more to do with holding it in your own wallet and using it than trading it on exchanges. With the new REX [ https://eosauthority.com/rex_history/ ] in action you can get \\u2018interest' by holding EOS. It's a reasonable passive income opportunity.  Security & Decentralization: Both, ETH's & EOS' security is provided by the network. ETH is protected by a global set of miners. But a miner with more resources can attach more hashpower and weaken the decentralization aspect of Ethereum. The network or an ETH holder cannot stop this from happening. It's the case with Bitcoin as 60% of the hashpower is controlled by just 5 people. EOS is a democratic system. The chain is protected by 21 voted block producers based on Delegated Proof of Stake [ https://twitter.com/mixdev/status/1143769516461023232 ]. Anyone holding EOS in their wallets can vote. A rogue block producer can be voted out simply by EOS account holders not voting them essentially kicking them out from the network. This will reinstate security of the blockchain. EOS has a potential problem of vote buying and other collusion channels. But the point is, the system has means to prevent or be offensive to those who act against the network; a feature Ethereum does not have.  Sustainability & Energy Efficiency: In a way, EOS is more sustainable than ETH. EOS is 17,236 times [ https://eosauthority.com/green/ ] more energy efficient than Ethereum.  EOS block producers run highly efficient server CPUs compared to high power GPUs or ASICs of ETH mining. This cuts down emissions as well as cost by a large margin.

Now that is ME and not You as I am quite happy with my Canon 70-D which I moved up to from a Canon Rebel t3i which is also a fine camera to use until it isn't any more.  Now IF you were to practice asking Better Questions then I can give you better answers. The word Better is the puzzling one in your question as I am left wondering what Better would include and so are you wanting to know which model has better Battery Life or is Better to shoot Video with or has a Better chance of Bouncing if you drop the thing on the ground. Now the thing might be Better  for me as I shoot on M for manual all the time whereas you might prefer to shoot on A for Automatic. So the 80-D may well be too complicated for you and full of features that you will struggle to understand the real purpose of. Now I may well decide that the 80-D is too heavy for me to carry with me when I go Hiking and so the 800-D or the Rebel series would be a better choice as I can just take the one lens [a Nifty Fifty] and I have got a compact and versatile lightweight Camera. Now I bought the Canon 70-D because I wanted to shoot Night Sky and other Night Shots and so I can also dial in degrees Kelvin on the camera to give a Custom background Colour when using artificial lighting which is just a Fun Thing anyway as one can shoot in RAW and do this in Lightroom anyway. I was also going to shoot Time-Lapse and this has not happened yet as neither has my Birding lens ever been used on Birds yet.

Let me give you this piece of advice: your camera is the least important thing in your camera bag. Lenses and lighting are far more important, and by far the most important piece of gear is the one between your ears. Invest your money accordingly.  A 5DS r is going for $3,700 new. An EOS R is going for $2000 for just the body. So I'm going to say your total budget is around $4500. A good rule of thumb is to spend 30% of your budget on the body and 70% on lenses. That gives you a budget of around $1350 for a camera body.  As a novice, you just don't need the capabilities of a state of the art camera. I have a 5D mark IV, and honestly 95% of the time any one of my older cameras (5D mark II, 7D, 50D) is going to do the job well enough.  Bottom line is that any pro-grade DSLR made in the last 10 years is going to serve your needs perfectly well. Save your money and buy a used 5D mark III ($900-$1200) or even a 5D mark II ($500\\u2013$800). Some reputable dealers for used equipment are B&H, Adorama, Abe's of Maine, KEH, and 42nd Street Photo.  Pair that body with a good general-purpose zoom lens like the EF 24\\u201370 f/4L IS ($900) to start with. The only other must-have accessories you need with that are a circular polarizing filter (around $100) and good tripod. That is a great kit to get you started learning photography.  Save the rest of your money for now until you reach the creative limits of your initial kit\\u2026 You shouldn't buy anything you don't have a specific need for. You might also seriously consider taking some of the money you save and spending it on some photography classes at your local community college.  What your second lens is going to be depends on the direction you go with your photography. My second lens was the EF 100 f/2.8L macro because I was limited in my ability to do flower pictures by not having a macro lens. My next several purchases were lighting gear. I've bought other pieces of equipment over the years to add new capabilities to allow me to do things I couldn't do with the equipment I had at the time. Avoid the temptation to buy things just because they're new and shiny.

And I think they made some good decisions, and a few bad ones that may have not been choices as much as technical limitations.  Neither Canon nor Nikon were actually new to mirrorless with last August's introductions. But the R and the Z are professional formats, even if the first models are not a match for the top-of-the-line DSLRs yet. Both Canon and Nikon took on the idea that mirrorless was something less than DSLR, a step between DSLR and compact digital cameras (aka point and shoot). Nikon's 1 system used the same 1\\u2033 sensor size found in high-end P&S cameras like the Sony RX10 and RX100. But Canon put out a very compact APS-C system with their EOS M. And a funny thing happened: while Nikon's 1 system is now defunct, the EOS M is very popular, albeit not necessarily in the USA. Canon's been the #2 mirrorless brand in Japan in 2016 and 2017 (BCN rankings, second to Olympus) and looks to be taking the #1 spot for the 2018 year\\u2026 without even counting the EOS R. Canon seems to have nailed the consumer mirrorless ILC with the EOS M.  So it should be no surprise that Canon got into mirrorless on a higher level with the EOS R, but then again, it should be. Canon is slower to react to competition than just about anyone. Why this, why now? Canon feels the competition.  For most of history since maybe the 1940s or 1950s, Canon and Nikon had much of the professional market for cameras. In the 1960s, led by Nikon, they won an 80% share, and it's been pretty much 80\\u201390% ever since. Canon managed to flip the market share on Nikon by being the first to court consumers, and then by delivering the fastest speeds for pro sports shooters. But for a long time, the only 35mm, then full-frame choice for most pros was Nikon or Canon.  This last year, the whole industry sold only 11.6 million ILCs, less than half of those sold in 2013. And 2017 was actually an 8% increase from 2016. But more the point, DSLRs sold only accounted for 65% of the ILC market\\u2026 clearly, Nikon and Canon were no longer winning an 80\\u201390% share. And while Canon's mirrorless sales were up 70% in 2017, Nikon wasn't even part of that. And of course, neither was competitive with Sony, Olympus, Panasonic, or Fujifilm in higher-end mirrorless. No one knows just where the DSLR vs. mirrorless ratio settles out in the long term, but it's not going to be terribly favorable to any company only making DSLRs.  What's It For?  If you look carefully at the EOS R, like the Nikon Z's, you'll know just what it's for: the EOS R is a mirrorless body for Canon users to buy, so that they don't buy Sonys. This is the big factor. Canon users have been trying Sony A7s with adapters, and liking them. Some keep it as an accessory, but some sell their Canon gear and move to Sony. Canon needs that to stop, and their first reaction to this situation is the EOS R.  Canon's introducing one body and four lenses, two of them quite expensive, but still, that's not a full system for nearly anyone who needs a system camera. It's a start. But if you're already a Canon shooter, the R is with an adapter is going to let you try out mirrorless with all of your glass \\u2014 even EF-S lenses, but EF-M lenses are impossible \\u2014 your existing batteries and flash units, etc. It's a much simpler way to experiment with mirrorless for today's Canon shooter. If you're new to ILCs and want full-frame mirrorless, EOS R won't be a great option for at least 3\\u20135 years, depending on how quickly Canon rolls out new glass.  So you're supposed to compare the EOS R to a Sony A7 Mark III, but the closest match is actually the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV. So you're getting more or less a mirrorless 5D Mark IV with some improvements/extra features for $900 less. That's a pretty fine deal, speaking from the Canon universe. It's a bit more expensive than the A7 Mark III, but no one's more aggressive on body pricing than Sony.  I think it succeeds in its mission. If I still had my Canon system and was ready for full frame mirrorless, the EOS R is a no-brainer versus the Sony. It's not even the cost of the bodies or the minute details of the features, but the fact it's already part of my system. The cheap lens adapter is only $100, and it works perfectly. For a bit more, I could get the adapter with filter holder, simply brilliant for video work.  Video Issues  Alas, on that latter one, Canon's still being Canon, and not in a good way. They're still crippling 4K video on the EOS R, delivering the same 1.7x crop you have on the EOS 5D mark IV. If you're buying a full-frame DSLR for video, the point is to have full frame video. With that crop, you're better off going to a Panasonic GH5 or a Blackmagic Design Pocket Cinema Camera 4K, depending on your needs.  I expect for most stills work, you have a 5D Mark IV as far as the quality goes. You won't quite match Sony in very low light, but you'll have a bit more resolution in bright light, so it's probably not a big deal for most photographers. You'll have the Canon color, which Sony has yet to match, and the Canon menus you're used to\\u2026 well, maybe. They have a few new controls on the camera, which changes around the way its used. There's a programmable ring control on lenses, but you won't run into that with adapted EF lenses unless you get the third adapter, the one with the ring control. There's also a touch strip on the back, which most reviewers aren't yet crazy about.  Neither Sony nor Canon has 10-bit in-camera video, which is what you need for serious Log shooting. But the EOS R does have that as an external option, at least. I'd bet on Sony's A7S Mark III offering 10-bit in some fashion, but like Canon, Sony's got their own cinema camera business they feel compelled to protect by crippling the mirrorless models. Oddly, though, Nikon opted for the same thing, in-camera 8-bit, external 10-bit, even without a video market to protect. I guess that leaves them both with a feature to add to a higher end model, next year. Or save money and buy the GH5 right now.  Conclusions  So basically, I think the EOS R is attractive to anyone with a full Canon system thinking about mirrorless. If Canon's annoying behaviors haven't driven you away yet, this may well be your mirrorless. I don't really find any huge problems with it. Knowing that Sony was the initial target, nothing about the EOS R or the Nikon Zs were particularly unexpected. Both aim for the Sony's, Nikon at both the A7III and the A7RIII, Canon's basically doing the A7III competitor now. I would hope they're holding off an A7RIII competitor until they have some improved sensor tech, probably also going into the EOS 5DS Mark II."}, {"upvote": 21, "content": "The EOS 1D X is pretty much overkill\\u2026 this is kind of an odd list, with over a 12:1 price range. Not only is the 1D X around $6,000 (body-only), but you're going to need expensive CFast cards for 4K video, and the 4K video on the thing is in gigantic Motion JPEG files, and not all that amazing anyway. If I wanted a 4K camera for video, I'd recommend either get a Panasonic GH4 or perhaps a Sony A7s mark II.  The Nikon D80 (2006) and the D3 (2007) are ancient models and don't shoot video. The D3s does shoot video, but only 720p, not full HD.  The EOS 7D (2009) is also fairly old. It can shoot 720p or 1080p video, but only 12 minutes at a time. The others here can shoot 29\\u203259\\u2033 without stopping \\u2014 that's a limit set to avoid paying a European camcorder tax. While it doesn't apply at all in the USA, most camera manufacturers (other than Panasonic, far as I know) impose this limit even on North American and Japanese models.  The Nikon D5300 isn't a bad choice for video. It's a few models old, it came out in 2003, the current model is the D5600, so it's may be available for a value price. But this line is a consumer line, APS-C sensor, and not terribly expensive. It can shoot video at 1080p up to 60fps\\u2026 not something you'd need for vlogging, but you want 60p for sports or other action video. Another advantage for vlogging, the D5300 has built-in WiFi, so it can be controlled wirelessly via an app. Most Canon and Nikon can be tethered via USB for remote control, and some have add-on controls, but it's handy to have it built-in.  I have the EOS 6D, and it produces amazing video, particularly in low light, where it blows away my far more expensive dedicated camcorders. The 6D right now is a good bargain, but mostly because everyone expects Canon to announce the 6D mark II Real Soon Now. The 6D also has built-in WiFi.  The EOS 5D mark III is the upgrade of Canon's breakthrough EOS 5D mark II. It's a great camera, one of the go-to standards for video-on-stills camera shooting. But while it's a solid choice if you can afford it, it's not the best choice. For one, it's been superceeded by the EOS 5D mark IV, if you're looking for a higher end model that shoots great video.  Of those on your list, the Canon EOS 80D would be my choice for anyone wanting a strong video option. Like the Nikon, it can shoot a variety of modes up to 1080p60. But the real advantage is in the sensor. This is Canon's second-generation mid-range DSLR with what they call a Dual Pixel sensor. This sensor splits each pixel into two separate photodiodes. Based on the way they're masked, each sensor pair works like a phase-detect autofocus sensor. So unlike every other DSLR on your list, the 80D can give you full performance autofocus in video, and things you usually just find on camcorders and mirrorless cameras, like follow-focus in video, etc. Dual Pixel is also used on Canon's 5D mark IV and all the new Cinema EOS video cameras. And the 80D also has built-in WiFi.  Far as the larger idea of a full camera system goes, you can't really go wrong with either Canon or Nikon. They have the two most complete lines of cameras and two most complete collection of lenses. However, neither offers a mirrorless option. So that means you're only shooting video from the back screen, not the viewfinder. And that only the 80D on your list has fully function video autofocus\\u2026 the others will AF in video, but it's on demand, not continuous, and it's often not very good. The phase detect sensors that DSLRs use are not available with the mirror up, which is what you have in video mode.  For one-person vlogging, keep in mind you are going to want to see yourself, which means either an add-on monitor while shooting or an articulated screen. The 80D and the D5300 both have fully articulated screens which let you see what you're recording from the front of the camera. The others do not, and will absolutely require an external monitor for vlogging."}, {"upvote": 11, "content": "Some camera companies revise the model number every time they release a new model. Canon does this with their consumer DSLRs. Nikon does it with all of them.  Canon is a bit weird with their consumer naming\\u2026 they use different names in Europe, the USA, and Japan, but all pretty sequential. On their advanced/professional line, they have the 1D (flagship full frame), the 5D (mainstream professional full frame), the 6D (prosumer full frame), and the 7D (professional APS-C)\\u2026 and those are always the base names. Sometimes with letter modifiers.  The mark indicates the major revision or edition of that. So they had the 5D, the 5D mark II, 5D mark III, and now the 5D mark IV.

There are a couple different 1D's as well: the 1D X mark II and the 1D C.  Olympus does a similar thing in their OM-D product line. The E-M1 mark II is the current pro model, the E-M5 mark II the current prosumer model, and the E-M5 mark III is the current consumer model.  Sony does it all over their product line: the RX series, the A7-series, eventually the A9-series, but not so much with the APS-C bodies. So far. Here's the RX10 mark IV\\u2026 easily IDed as the mark IV. The basic idea of a particular product is revised every two years or so, but it's still recognizable as that model. It's particularly important for Sony because they don't always withdraw the old model when then new comes out.  This is fairly useful, if you're not going to revise the product name. Apple's been notorious for this for some time. There is a double-secret product code for every Apple product, but that's not usually a consumer thing. So you have the iPhone.

Yes I had a Canon 70-D for a while until I grew out of it and found it lacking. Because it is a cropped sensor it doesn't do Wide as for example if you put a 14 mm lens on an 80-D it becomes the equivalent of about a 23 mm on a full frame DSLR so not exactly Super Wide at all. Cropped sensors are lacking in low light compared to full frame performance and so for me a Canon 80-D is not an ideal camera for what I do.  There is a lack of Canon Lenses which are Quality Built and designed to be used on the Cropped sensor camera's so what happens is that the lenses that are designed to be used on Full Frame Cameras will also fit the cropped sensor Camera's and so one has to buy that extra size which is very expensive but one cannot use the lens as it was designed to be used. So we end up buying extra size and carrying extra weight that we cannot use because it is designed to provide an image suitable for a much larger sensor.

So here is information from:  Canon 80D vs Canon M100 Comparison Review [ https://www.apotelyt.com/compare-camera/canon-80d-vs-canon-m100 ]  Which I have copied the review from.  But I suggest you read the whole article.  Arguments in favor of the Canon EOS 80D:   * Better sound: Can connect to an external microphone for higher quality sound recording.  * Better sound control: Has a headphone port that enables audio monitoring while recording.  * Easier framing: Has an optical viewfinder for image composition and settings control.  * Easier setting verification: Features an LCD display on top to control shooting parameters.  * More flexible LCD: Has a swivel screen for odd-angle shots in portrait or landscape orientation.  * Faster shutter: Has higher mechanical shutter speed (1/8000s vs 1/4000s) to freeze action.  * Faster burst: Shoots at higher frequency (7 vs 6.1 flaps/sec) to capture the decisive moment.  * Easier time-lapse photography: Has an intervalometer built-in for low frequency shooting.  * Longer lasting: Can take more shots (960 versus 295) on a single battery charge.  * Better sealing: Is weather sealed to enable shooting in dusty or wet environments.  * Better lighting: Features a hotshoe and can thus hold and trigger an external flash gun.  * More heavily discounted: Has been on the market for longer (launched in February 2016). Advantages of the Canon EOS M100:   * Better jpgs: Has a more modern image processing engine (DIGIC 7 vs DIGIC 6).  * More compact: Is smaller (108x67mm vs 139x105mm) and will fit more readily into a bag.  * Less heavy: Has a lower weight (by 428g or 59 percent) and is thus easier to take along.  * More legacy lens friendly: Can use many non-native lenses via adapters.  * Easier wireless transfer: Supports Bluetooth for image sharing without cables.  * More affordable: Was introduced into a lower priced category (58 percent cheaper at launch).  * More modern: Was introduced somewhat (1 year and 6 months) more recently. If the count of relative strengths (bullet points above) is taken as a measure, the 80D is the clear winner of the match-up (12 : 7 points). However, the relative importance of the various individual camera aspects will vary according to personal preferences and needs, so that you might like to apply corresponding weights to the particular features before making a decision on a new camera."}, {"upvote": 0, "content": "It is a good camera if you know its limits.

Do not get this line of thinking stuck in your head because it's not entirely true. In fact, to be honest, this statement is used many times by people who simply can't afford good gear and are jealous at those who can. If you can't afford good gear right now, that's fine; work with what you can afford and save up money to grow into better gear over time. The best camera is always the one you have with you and by this I mean, if you own a $6,500 Canon 1DX and it's sitting at home, your best camera may be the free one that came built into the phone in your pocket!  While it is true, skill is the most important aspect of almost anything, including photography, your gear and even more specifically, your lenses, are just as important. A good lens on an inexpensive camera is always better than a cheap lens on an expensive camera. If you're just starting out and looking for a camera for a beginner, try to think about what sort of photography you'll be doing. General photography such as family photos, photos of your friends, pets, etc.; landscape photography; wildlife photography; street photography, etc. If you don't know yet, that's okay but if you have a goal of developing skills specific to one of these styles, it will help with camera selection.  When getting started, I'd get something inexpensive but not so cheap that your photo quality ends up discouraging you altogether (again, this is where the \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" nonsense kicks in.) I'll cover a couple types and why they're good starter cameras. And with any camera you choose, always try to keep the camera out of \\\"automatic mode\\\" if possible so you begin to master the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  Point-and-Shoot or Camera Phone  These cameras are very inexpensive and with the newer smartphones, the camera is built right in and often takes better photos than the DSLR's from just a few years ago! This is the most inexpensive route to take (and may not cost a penny if you use the camera on your phone) and it helps you learn about composition, lighting, etc. If you're already past this point and want a camera you can grow into, the following are good options:  Traditional SLR's  I know, this is probably not what most people think of when deciding on a beginner's camera but I want to mention it because if you have one of these lying around in your house (parent's or grandparent's old camera, etc.), they're great for learning the basics of a camera with all of the digital stuff removed. SLR (single lens reflex) cameras aren't used much anymore because of the cost of operation, decreased photo quality, and lack of film processing labs, however, I think any aspiring photographer should own or at least use one because they are the \\\"original camera\\\", they are inexpensive, and they help give you a greater appreciation for the luxury of digital photography (not limited to 24-36 photos per roll, immediate results where you can see your photo seconds after taking it, easy and fast multiple frame shooting, and no cost by ruining a roll of film or wasting it on bad photos.) If you buy a traditional SLR 35mm camera, I'd go for something like the Nikon 35mm F2AS with a 50mm \\\"prime lens\\\", or similar. Here's a photo of one of mine:  Digital SLR's  Digital SLR's, or DSLR's, have been the most popular choice for many years now, they're easy to find used, and they're a good starting point in learning photography. These cameras are basically digital versions of the original SLR camera but offer much more flexibility and many more options. Whagt we're seeing right now, however, is a switch from DSLR's to \\\"mirrorless cameras\\\", including the very popular \\\"Micro Four Thirds\\\" cameras which use a smaller sensor, yet often outperform the DSLR's. I'll touch on those, below. Anyway, an inexpensive or used DSLR is a good choice for starting out and I'd recommend an entry level Canon DSLR such as one of the \\\"Rebel\\\" series cameras. I currently use a Canon 1DX which is NOT a beginner's camera, and my old Canon 5D Mark II (this is a great beginner's camera, easy to find, and inexpensive.) Here's a photo of the Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm prime lens attached:  Mirrorless Cameras  These cameras really are \\\"the future of photography\\\" although many professional photographers would scoff at you for even suggesting such a thing because just as it was when SLR's were phasing out, DSLR using pro's often get stuck in their ways and refuse to move with the times. Even today there are professional photographers who refuse to switch from SLR to DSLR! Mirrorless cameras are superior to DSLR's in almost every way: They have higher resolution (megapixels) for a fraction of the cost of DSLR's; there's no mirror flapping around making noise and causing camera vibration; they're smaller and easier to carry, many can shoot 4K and even Cinema 4K video (while Canon and Nikon refuse to adapt and offer this feature for a reasonable price in their DSLR's); and overall, they're less expensive. If you can afford one (they're often cheaper than many new DSLR's), go for it! I currently shoot with a Panasonic Lumix GH4 because I shoot photography AND I need to shoot 4K video and this camera does both. An even less expensive alternative is the Lumix GH3 which sells for around $500, a quarter of the price of the GH4. Here's a photo of the Lumix GH4, a \\\"mirrorless camera\\\":  Regardless of what you choose, unless it's a cheap $30 point-and-shoot or your phone's camera, try to make a decision on which camera format you want to grow into, otherwise you'll be wasting money on a camera and the expensive lenses that you'll end up not using when you switch to a different format.  Taking an introductory photography class or workshop is also a good idea when getting started as you'll more quickly learn the basics including aperture, exposure, shutter speed, composition, and editing. Good luck with your search and your journey into photography!"}, {"upvote": 5, "content": "It depends on what lenses you are planning to buy.  The M100 has a very limited lens selection.  You have the kit lens line up with 11-22mm, 15-45mm, 15-150mm, 55-200mm, and you have three primes, 22mm f2 and 34mm f1.4.  The 15-45mm kit lens will come with the camera, but it won't be that different from a high end cell phone.  The 55-200mm lens will be something you can't get in a phone. That one will be good for portraits. So will the 15-150mm.  The 22mm f2 is also good. It is a sharp lens that has the same usefulness as a cell phone but it will give you a lot better quality pictures than a cell phone. It should be a great travel lens. With that one the camera could fit in a large pocket or a purse.  The 34mm f1.4 is a high quality, expensive lens. It should be good for portraits and group photos, as well as landscape photos. It is the equivalent of a 55mm f2.2 Full frame lens, which isn't too shabby.

Not only is the 1D X around $6,000 (body-only), but you're going to need expensive CFast cards for 4K video, and the 4K video on the thing is in gigantic Motion JPEG files, and not all that amazing anyway. If I wanted a 4K camera for video, I'd recommend either get a Panasonic GH4 or perhaps a Sony A7s mark II.  The Nikon D80 (2006) and the D3 (2007) are ancient models and don't shoot video. The D3s does shoot video, but only 720p, not full HD.  The EOS 7D (2009) is also fairly old. It can shoot 720p or 1080p video, but only 12 minutes at a time. The others here can shoot 29\\u203259\\u2033 without stopping \\u2014 that's a limit set to avoid paying a European camcorder tax. While it doesn't apply at all in the USA, most camera manufacturers (other than Panasonic, far as I know) impose this limit even on North American and Japanese models.  The Nikon D5300 isn't a bad choice for video. It's a few models old, it came out in 2003, the current model is the D5600, so it's may be available for a value price. But this line is a consumer line, APS-C sensor, and not terribly expensive. It can shoot video at 1080p up to 60fps\\u2026 not something you'd need for vlogging, but you want 60p for sports or other action video. Another advantage for vlogging, the D5300 has built-in WiFi, so it can be controlled wirelessly via an app. Most Canon and Nikon can be tethered via USB for remote control, and some have add-on controls, but it's handy to have it built-in.  I have the EOS 6D, and it produces amazing video, particularly in low light, where it blows away my far more expensive dedicated camcorders. The 6D right now is a good bargain, but mostly because everyone expects Canon to announce the 6D mark II Real Soon Now. The 6D also has built-in WiFi.  The EOS 5D mark III is the upgrade of Canon's breakthrough EOS 5D mark II. It's a great camera, one of the go-to standards for video-on-stills camera shooting. But while it's a solid choice if you can afford it, it's not the best choice. For one, it's been superceeded by the EOS 5D mark IV, if you're looking for a higher end model that shoots great video.  Of those on your list, the Canon EOS 80D would be my choice for anyone wanting a strong video option. Like the Nikon, it can shoot a variety of modes up to 1080p60. But the real advantage is in the sensor. This is Canon's second-generation mid-range DSLR with what they call a Dual Pixel sensor. This sensor splits each pixel into two separate photodiodes. Based on the way they're masked, each sensor pair works like a phase-detect autofocus sensor. So unlike every other DSLR on your list, the 80D can give you full performance autofocus in video, and things you usually just find on camcorders and mirrorless cameras, like follow-focus in video, etc. Dual Pixel is also used on Canon's 5D mark IV and all the new Cinema EOS video cameras. And the 80D also has built-in WiFi.  Far as the larger idea of a full camera system goes, you can't really go wrong with either Canon or Nikon. They have the two most complete lines of cameras and two most complete collection of lenses. However, neither offers a mirrorless option. So that means you're only shooting video from the back screen, not the viewfinder. And that only the 80D on your list has fully function video autofocus\\u2026 the others will AF in video, but it's on demand, not continuous, and it's often not very good. The phase detect sensors that DSLRs use are not available with the mirror up, which is what you have in video mode.  For one-person vlogging, keep in mind you are going to want to see yourself, which means either an add-on monitor while shooting or an articulated screen. The 80D and the D5300 both have fully articulated screens which let you see what you're recording from the front of the camera. The others do not, and will absolutely require an external monitor for vlogging."}, {"upvote": 8, "content": "Yes, it is a great all around camera in APSC format.

One digit names, such as EOS5D: Professionals Having said this, a 250D offers a truckload of features which you also can find at professional cameras. And its 21 mp sensor delivers a stunning quality, which easily can compete with professional cameras. So, if you are skilled and use good lenses, there won't be much difference to images shot with an EOS 90 D for three times the money.  The differences to professional gear nevertheless are striking: Professional cameras deliver a far better user interface, a more rugged body, a better finder, often a faster AF, a faster shutter and an overall longer lifespan.  Maybe you compare it with a drilling machine. You can buy one for less than 100 USD at your local hardware store, and when you want to drill a 10 mm hole into something three times a year, it will serve you forever (mine is more than 30 years old today). But if you happen to be a construction worker, drilling 50 holes a day under different weather conditions, your drilling machine may cost ten times as much - for a reason.  There is another thing to mention: The EOS 250D has a so called crop sensor, size 15x23 mm. It is cropped against a so called full format sensor (24x36 mm) which is as big as a 35 mm film frame. A Canon EOS 5D Mk. 4 costs about five times as much as a Canon EOS 250D, and it has a full format sensor. Lenses which are computed to work with a 35 mm full format camera, require a full format sensor. Canon makes very expensive professional lenses, the so called L series. All these L-lenses are designed for full format cameras. They also work with crop cameras, but they do not unleash their full potential on crop cameras.

Do not get this line of thinking stuck in your head because it's not entirely true. In fact, to be honest, this statement is used many times by people who simply can't afford good gear and are jealous at those who can. If you can't afford good gear right now, that's fine; work with what you can afford and save up money to grow into better gear over time. The best camera is always the one you have with you and by this I mean, if you own a $6,500 Canon 1DX and it's sitting at home, your best camera may be the free one that came built into the phone in your pocket!  While it is true, skill is the most important aspect of almost anything, including photography, your gear and even more specifically, your lenses, are just as important. A good lens on an inexpensive camera is always better than a cheap lens on an expensive camera. If you're just starting out and looking for a camera for a beginner, try to think about what sort of photography you'll be doing. General photography such as family photos, photos of your friends, pets, etc.; landscape photography; wildlife photography; street photography, etc. If you don't know yet, that's okay but if you have a goal of developing skills specific to one of these styles, it will help with camera selection.  When getting started, I'd get something inexpensive but not so cheap that your photo quality ends up discouraging you altogether (again, this is where the \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" nonsense kicks in.) I'll cover a couple types and why they're good starter cameras. And with any camera you choose, always try to keep the camera out of \\\"automatic mode\\\" if possible so you begin to master the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  Point-and-Shoot or Camera Phone  These cameras are very inexpensive and with the newer smartphones, the camera is built right in and often takes better photos than the DSLR's from just a few years ago! This is the most inexpensive route to take (and may not cost a penny if you use the camera on your phone) and it helps you learn about composition, lighting, etc. If you're already past this point and want a camera you can grow into, the following are good options:  Traditional SLR's  I know, this is probably not what most people think of when deciding on a beginner's camera but I want to mention it because if you have one of these lying around in your house (parent's or grandparent's old camera, etc.), they're great for learning the basics of a camera with all of the digital stuff removed. SLR (single lens reflex) cameras aren't used much anymore because of the cost of operation, decreased photo quality, and lack of film processing labs, however, I think any aspiring photographer should own or at least use one because they are the \\\"original camera\\\", they are inexpensive, and they help give you a greater appreciation for the luxury of digital photography (not limited to 24-36 photos per roll, immediate results where you can see your photo seconds after taking it, easy and fast multiple frame shooting, and no cost by ruining a roll of film or wasting it on bad photos.) If you buy a traditional SLR 35mm camera, I'd go for something like the Nikon 35mm F2AS with a 50mm \\\"prime lens\\\", or similar. Here's a photo of one of mine:  Digital SLR's  Digital SLR's, or DSLR's, have been the most popular choice for many years now, they're easy to find used, and they're a good starting point in learning photography. These cameras are basically digital versions of the original SLR camera but offer much more flexibility and many more options. Whagt we're seeing right now, however, is a switch from DSLR's to \\\"mirrorless cameras\\\", including the very popular \\\"Micro Four Thirds\\\" cameras which use a smaller sensor, yet often outperform the DSLR's. I'll touch on those, below. Anyway, an inexpensive or used DSLR is a good choice for starting out and I'd recommend an entry level Canon DSLR such as one of the \\\"Rebel\\\" series cameras. I currently use a Canon 1DX which is NOT a beginner's camera, and my old Canon 5D Mark II (this is a great beginner's camera, easy to find, and inexpensive.) Here's a photo of the Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm prime lens attached:  Mirrorless Cameras  These cameras really are \\\"the future of photography\\\" although many professional photographers would scoff at you for even suggesting such a thing because just as it was when SLR's were phasing out, DSLR using pro's often get stuck in their ways and refuse to move with the times. Even today there are professional photographers who refuse to switch from SLR to DSLR! Mirrorless cameras are superior to DSLR's in almost every way: They have higher resolution (megapixels) for a fraction of the cost of DSLR's; there's no mirror flapping around making noise and causing camera vibration; they're smaller and easier to carry, many can shoot 4K and even Cinema 4K video (while Canon and Nikon refuse to adapt and offer this feature for a reasonable price in their DSLR's); and overall, they're less expensive. If you can afford one (they're often cheaper than many new DSLR's), go for it! I currently shoot with a Panasonic Lumix GH4 because I shoot photography AND I need to shoot 4K video and this camera does both. An even less expensive alternative is the Lumix GH3 which sells for around $500, a quarter of the price of the GH4. Here's a photo of the Lumix GH4, a \\\"mirrorless camera\\\":  Regardless of what you choose, unless it's a cheap $30 point-and-shoot or your phone's camera, try to make a decision on which camera format you want to grow into, otherwise you'll be wasting money on a camera and the expensive lenses that you'll end up not using when you switch to a different format.  Taking an introductory photography class or workshop is also a good idea when getting started as you'll more quickly learn the basics including aperture, exposure, shutter speed, composition, and editing.

And I think they made some good decisions, and a few bad ones that may have not been choices as much as technical limitations.  Neither Canon nor Nikon were actually new to mirrorless with last August's introductions. But the R and the Z are professional formats, even if the first models are not a match for the top-of-the-line DSLRs yet. Both Canon and Nikon took on the idea that mirrorless was something less than DSLR, a step between DSLR and compact digital cameras (aka point and shoot). Nikon's 1 system used the same 1\\u2033 sensor size found in high-end P&S cameras like the Sony RX10 and RX100. But Canon put out a very compact APS-C system with their EOS M. And a funny thing happened: while Nikon's 1 system is now defunct, the EOS M is very popular, albeit not necessarily in the USA. Canon's been the #2 mirrorless brand in Japan in 2016 and 2017 (BCN rankings, second to Olympus) and looks to be taking the #1 spot for the 2018 year\\u2026 without even counting the EOS R. Canon seems to have nailed the consumer mirrorless ILC with the EOS M.  So it should be no surprise that Canon got into mirrorless on a higher level with the EOS R, but then again, it should be. Canon is slower to react to competition than just about anyone. Why this, why now? Canon feels the competition.  For most of history since maybe the 1940s or 1950s, Canon and Nikon had much of the professional market for cameras. In the 1960s, led by Nikon, they won an 80% share, and it's been pretty much 80\\u201390% ever since. Canon managed to flip the market share on Nikon by being the first to court consumers, and then by delivering the fastest speeds for pro sports shooters. But for a long time, the only 35mm, then full-frame choice for most pros was Nikon or Canon.  This last year, the whole industry sold only 11.6 million ILCs, less than half of those sold in 2013. And 2017 was actually an 8% increase from 2016. But more the point, DSLRs sold only accounted for 65% of the ILC market\\u2026 clearly, Nikon and Canon were no longer winning an 80\\u201390% share. And while Canon's mirrorless sales were up 70% in 2017, Nikon wasn't even part of that. And of course, neither was competitive with Sony, Olympus, Panasonic, or Fujifilm in higher-end mirrorless. No one knows just where the DSLR vs. mirrorless ratio settles out in the long term, but it's not going to be terribly favorable to any company only making DSLRs.  What's It For?  If you look carefully at the EOS R, like the Nikon Z's, you'll know just what it's for: the EOS R is a mirrorless body for Canon users to buy, so that they don't buy Sonys. This is the big factor. Canon users have been trying Sony A7s with adapters, and liking them. Some keep it as an accessory, but some sell their Canon gear and move to Sony. Canon needs that to stop, and their first reaction to this situation is the EOS R.  Canon's introducing one body and four lenses, two of them quite expensive, but still, that's not a full system for nearly anyone who needs a system camera. It's a start. But if you're already a Canon shooter, the R is with an adapter is going to let you try out mirrorless with all of your glass \\u2014 even EF-S lenses, but EF-M lenses are impossible \\u2014 your existing batteries and flash units, etc. It's a much simpler way to experiment with mirrorless for today's Canon shooter. If you're new to ILCs and want full-frame mirrorless, EOS R won't be a great option for at least 3\\u20135 years, depending on how quickly Canon rolls out new glass.  So you're supposed to compare the EOS R to a Sony A7 Mark III, but the closest match is actually the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV. So you're getting more or less a mirrorless 5D Mark IV with some improvements/extra features for $900 less. That's a pretty fine deal, speaking from the Canon universe. It's a bit more expensive than the A7 Mark III, but no one's more aggressive on body pricing than Sony.  I think it succeeds in its mission. If I still had my Canon system and was ready for full frame mirrorless, the EOS R is a no-brainer versus the Sony. It's not even the cost of the bodies or the minute details of the features, but the fact it's already part of my system. The cheap lens adapter is only $100, and it works perfectly. For a bit more, I could get the adapter with filter holder, simply brilliant for video work.  Video Issues  Alas, on that latter one, Canon's still being Canon, and not in a good way. They're still crippling 4K video on the EOS R, delivering the same 1.7x crop you have on the EOS 5D mark IV. If you're buying a full-frame DSLR for video, the point is to have full frame video. With that crop, you're better off going to a Panasonic GH5 or a Blackmagic Design Pocket Cinema Camera 4K, depending on your needs.  I expect for most stills work, you have a 5D Mark IV as far as the quality goes. You won't quite match Sony in very low light, but you'll have a bit more resolution in bright light, so it's probably not a big deal for most photographers. You'll have the Canon color, which Sony has yet to match, and the Canon menus you're used to\\u2026 well, maybe. They have a few new controls on the camera, which changes around the way its used. There's a programmable ring control on lenses, but you won't run into that with adapted EF lenses unless you get the third adapter, the one with the ring control. There's also a touch strip on the back, which most reviewers aren't yet crazy about.  Neither Sony nor Canon has 10-bit in-camera video, which is what you need for serious Log shooting. But the EOS R does have that as an external option, at least. I'd bet on Sony's A7S Mark III offering 10-bit in some fashion, but like Canon, Sony's got their own cinema camera business they feel compelled to protect by crippling the mirrorless models. Oddly, though, Nikon opted for the same thing, in-camera 8-bit, external 10-bit, even without a video market to protect. I guess that leaves them both with a feature to add to a higher end model, next year. Or save money and buy the GH5 right now.  Conclusions  So basically, I think the EOS R is attractive to anyone with a full Canon system thinking about mirrorless. If Canon's annoying behaviors haven't driven you away yet, this may well be your mirrorless. I don't really find any huge problems with it. Knowing that Sony was the initial target, nothing about the EOS R or the Nikon Zs were particularly unexpected. Both aim for the Sony's, Nikon at both the A7III and the A7RIII, Canon's basically doing the A7III competitor now. I would hope they're holding off an A7RIII competitor until they have some improved sensor tech, probably also going into the EOS 5DS Mark II."}, {"upvote": 5, "content": "None.

The 15-45mm kit lens will come with the camera, but it won't be that different from a high end cell phone.  The 55-200mm lens will be something you can't get in a phone. That one will be good for portraits. So will the 15-150mm.  The 22mm f2 is also good. It is a sharp lens that has the same usefulness as a cell phone but it will give you a lot better quality pictures than a cell phone. It should be a great travel lens. With that one the camera could fit in a large pocket or a purse.  The 34mm f1.4 is a high quality, expensive lens. It should be good for portraits and group photos, as well as landscape photos. It is the equivalent of a 55mm f2.2 Full frame lens, which isn't too shabby.

Then he explained me the matter. Coincidentally he had the same camera and we called it 700D.  So, you see, there's no actual difference between a Canon EOS and Rebel. It's just the nomenclature strategy of Canon.  But keep in mind that only entry level Canon DSLRs are called as Rebel in USA.

Not only is the 1D X around $6,000 (body-only), but you're going to need expensive CFast cards for 4K video, and the 4K video on the thing is in gigantic Motion JPEG files, and not all that amazing anyway. If I wanted a 4K camera for video, I'd recommend either get a Panasonic GH4 or perhaps a Sony A7s mark II.  The Nikon D80 (2006) and the D3 (2007) are ancient models and don't shoot video. The D3s does shoot video, but only 720p, not full HD.  The EOS 7D (2009) is also fairly old. It can shoot 720p or 1080p video, but only 12 minutes at a time. The others here can shoot 29\\u203259\\u2033 without stopping \\u2014 that's a limit set to avoid paying a European camcorder tax. While it doesn't apply at all in the USA, most camera manufacturers (other than Panasonic, far as I know) impose this limit even on North American and Japanese models.  The Nikon D5300 isn't a bad choice for video. It's a few models old, it came out in 2003, the current model is the D5600, so it's may be available for a value price. But this line is a consumer line, APS-C sensor, and not terribly expensive. It can shoot video at 1080p up to 60fps\\u2026 not something you'd need for vlogging, but you want 60p for sports or other action video. Another advantage for vlogging, the D5300 has built-in WiFi, so it can be controlled wirelessly via an app. Most Canon and Nikon can be tethered via USB for remote control, and some have add-on controls, but it's handy to have it built-in.  I have the EOS 6D, and it produces amazing video, particularly in low light, where it blows away my far more expensive dedicated camcorders. The 6D right now is a good bargain, but mostly because everyone expects Canon to announce the 6D mark II Real Soon Now. The 6D also has built-in WiFi.  The EOS 5D mark III is the upgrade of Canon's breakthrough EOS 5D mark II. It's a great camera, one of the go-to standards for video-on-stills camera shooting. But while it's a solid choice if you can afford it, it's not the best choice. For one, it's been superceeded by the EOS 5D mark IV, if you're looking for a higher end model that shoots great video.  Of those on your list, the Canon EOS 80D would be my choice for anyone wanting a strong video option. Like the Nikon, it can shoot a variety of modes up to 1080p60. But the real advantage is in the sensor. This is Canon's second-generation mid-range DSLR with what they call a Dual Pixel sensor. This sensor splits each pixel into two separate photodiodes. Based on the way they're masked, each sensor pair works like a phase-detect autofocus sensor. So unlike every other DSLR on your list, the 80D can give you full performance autofocus in video, and things you usually just find on camcorders and mirrorless cameras, like follow-focus in video, etc. Dual Pixel is also used on Canon's 5D mark IV and all the new Cinema EOS video cameras. And the 80D also has built-in WiFi.  Far as the larger idea of a full camera system goes, you can't really go wrong with either Canon or Nikon. They have the two most complete lines of cameras and two most complete collection of lenses. However, neither offers a mirrorless option. So that means you're only shooting video from the back screen, not the viewfinder. And that only the 80D on your list has fully function video autofocus\\u2026 the others will AF in video, but it's on demand, not continuous, and it's often not very good. The phase detect sensors that DSLRs use are not available with the mirror up, which is what you have in video mode.  For one-person vlogging, keep in mind you are going to want to see yourself, which means either an add-on monitor while shooting or an articulated screen. The 80D and the D5300 both have fully articulated screens which let you see what you're recording from the front of the camera. The others do not, and will absolutely require an external monitor for vlogging."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "Not many if you are an enthusiast Canon shooter.

Do not get this line of thinking stuck in your head because it's not entirely true. In fact, to be honest, this statement is used many times by people who simply can't afford good gear and are jealous at those who can. If you can't afford good gear right now, that's fine; work with what you can afford and save up money to grow into better gear over time. The best camera is always the one you have with you and by this I mean, if you own a $6,500 Canon 1DX and it's sitting at home, your best camera may be the free one that came built into the phone in your pocket!  While it is true, skill is the most important aspect of almost anything, including photography, your gear and even more specifically, your lenses, are just as important. A good lens on an inexpensive camera is always better than a cheap lens on an expensive camera. If you're just starting out and looking for a camera for a beginner, try to think about what sort of photography you'll be doing. General photography such as family photos, photos of your friends, pets, etc.; landscape photography; wildlife photography; street photography, etc. If you don't know yet, that's okay but if you have a goal of developing skills specific to one of these styles, it will help with camera selection.  When getting started, I'd get something inexpensive but not so cheap that your photo quality ends up discouraging you altogether (again, this is where the \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" nonsense kicks in.) I'll cover a couple types and why they're good starter cameras. And with any camera you choose, always try to keep the camera out of \\\"automatic mode\\\" if possible so you begin to master the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  Point-and-Shoot or Camera Phone  These cameras are very inexpensive and with the newer smartphones, the camera is built right in and often takes better photos than the DSLR's from just a few years ago! This is the most inexpensive route to take (and may not cost a penny if you use the camera on your phone) and it helps you learn about composition, lighting, etc. If you're already past this point and want a camera you can grow into, the following are good options:  Traditional SLR's  I know, this is probably not what most people think of when deciding on a beginner's camera but I want to mention it because if you have one of these lying around in your house (parent's or grandparent's old camera, etc.), they're great for learning the basics of a camera with all of the digital stuff removed. SLR (single lens reflex) cameras aren't used much anymore because of the cost of operation, decreased photo quality, and lack of film processing labs, however, I think any aspiring photographer should own or at least use one because they are the \\\"original camera\\\", they are inexpensive, and they help give you a greater appreciation for the luxury of digital photography (not limited to 24-36 photos per roll, immediate results where you can see your photo seconds after taking it, easy and fast multiple frame shooting, and no cost by ruining a roll of film or wasting it on bad photos.) If you buy a traditional SLR 35mm camera, I'd go for something like the Nikon 35mm F2AS with a 50mm \\\"prime lens\\\", or similar. Here's a photo of one of mine:  Digital SLR's  Digital SLR's, or DSLR's, have been the most popular choice for many years now, they're easy to find used, and they're a good starting point in learning photography. These cameras are basically digital versions of the original SLR camera but offer much more flexibility and many more options. Whagt we're seeing right now, however, is a switch from DSLR's to \\\"mirrorless cameras\\\", including the very popular \\\"Micro Four Thirds\\\" cameras which use a smaller sensor, yet often outperform the DSLR's. I'll touch on those, below. Anyway, an inexpensive or used DSLR is a good choice for starting out and I'd recommend an entry level Canon DSLR such as one of the \\\"Rebel\\\" series cameras. I currently use a Canon 1DX which is NOT a beginner's camera, and my old Canon 5D Mark II (this is a great beginner's camera, easy to find, and inexpensive.) Here's a photo of the Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm prime lens attached:  Mirrorless Cameras  These cameras really are \\\"the future of photography\\\" although many professional photographers would scoff at you for even suggesting such a thing because just as it was when SLR's were phasing out, DSLR using pro's often get stuck in their ways and refuse to move with the times. Even today there are professional photographers who refuse to switch from SLR to DSLR! Mirrorless cameras are superior to DSLR's in almost every way: They have higher resolution (megapixels) for a fraction of the cost of DSLR's; there's no mirror flapping around making noise and causing camera vibration; they're smaller and easier to carry, many can shoot 4K and even Cinema 4K video (while Canon and Nikon refuse to adapt and offer this feature for a reasonable price in their DSLR's); and overall, they're less expensive. If you can afford one (they're often cheaper than many new DSLR's), go for it! I currently shoot with a Panasonic Lumix GH4 because I shoot photography AND I need to shoot 4K video and this camera does both. An even less expensive alternative is the Lumix GH3 which sells for around $500, a quarter of the price of the GH4. Here's a photo of the Lumix GH4, a \\\"mirrorless camera\\\":  Regardless of what you choose, unless it's a cheap $30 point-and-shoot or your phone's camera, try to make a decision on which camera format you want to grow into, otherwise you'll be wasting money on a camera and the expensive lenses that you'll end up not using when you switch to a different format.  Taking an introductory photography class or workshop is also a good idea when getting started as you'll more quickly learn the basics including aperture, exposure, shutter speed, composition, and editing.

Some posts transfer you on every promotion. If you love your city and wish to work there, look at the posting details of the CGL job you're aiming for. Also, you cannot always predict your rank and know for sure that you will get the posting you're aiming at. 2. Career growth. Sadly, most departments are still slow when it comes to promotions. Top positions are always captured by directly recruited officers by UPSC. It is very unlikely for you to rise to that position no matter how hard you work. Your promotion is not on merit but on the years of service. In private sector, merit gets more recognition. 3. Lifestyle. Office culture is not too great generally. It is not like corporates where sir/ma'am culture has ended and there's a proper HR section to take care of you and your motivation levels. Government offices are still old school. 4. Salary. For 4600 GP, in-hand salary in X city, which is the best you can get (excluding AAO) is around \\u20b960,000 per month. It is 40% less than what you've compared it with in the question. 5.

Now, you can decide."}, {"upvote": 131, "content": "I have Worked in SBI as a PO for almost 1 year and I also have many friends working as AAO after cracking SSC CGL AAO exam. There is no doubt that AAO is a much better job w.r.t all parameters that can be analysed. Some parameters which have been used by me to compare the two are:  1. PAY AND PERKS: SSC AAO offers much better pay as well as perks when compared with SBI PO. Not only are perks and pay better, it is also much more easy to use those perks as an AAO officer. The Human Resource in SBI takes a lot of time in clearing one's Perks which results in mental harassment and dissatisfaction with the organisation.  2. STATUS IN SOCIETY:  Let us face the truth, Bankers are not considered as important in our society today and other Government officers.  Although both Banking and CAG are expanding very fast and are bound to get even bigger in the future, CAG holds much more importance when it comes to the kind of work they do.  There is no fault of Bankers here. It is just the way Banking is perceived by the Government and People.  3. PAY COMMISSIONS:  The official pay commissions do not apply to bankers. Banking Union bargains separately with the government for its Pay and Perks. This leaves is more vulnerable to exploitation by the Government.  On the other hand, SSC Officers are linked with the overall Pay commission revision, which makes it more powerful in terms of revision of Pay regularly.  4. TRANSFER POLICIES:  Transfer Policies of CAG are very liberal and employee friendly. In long run, it is a more employee oriented organisation, which believes in taking care of its employees, Just Like RBI.  On the other hand, Transfer Policies of SBI are considered to be the worst among all Nationalised Banks. It follows a policy of frequent transfers into hinterlands of the country. While this approach provides a better learning to employees, it often results in discomfort considering that perks and basic facilities are hard to attain due to perk policy of SBI, when transferred frequently.  5. COLLEAGUES:  Here, both CAG and SBI stand at the same platform. There is a wide age gap within both organisations due to no hiring between 1990s and early 2000s. This results in a more monotonous work life for new comers. Offices are often filled with employees in the age group of 40\\u201360, taking a toll of new and young employees.  6. LUNCH TIME:  Although this is a very minor issue but it has a big impact on psychological satisfaction among employees. SBI does not provide an official LUNCH TIME to its employees. This means that all employees in a particular branch cannot eat their meals together. Lunch time is often an important part of Quality of Work Life. This leaves young employees like us dissatisfied with our work environment as we are unable to create an active social life within our work premises.  7. FUTURE PROSPECTS:  Here both organisations stand at par. Both institutions are expanding fast and are bound to expand further in the future.

(If it is dark enough you will see some stars. You might even be able to see the Milky Way in very dry and dark places). Take your first burst of shots. Take at least 3 at each setting. Set your shutter speed to 1 second and repeat the process Keep changing your shutter speeds and checking the results on your LCD screen. Take longer shots and shorter shots. The longer your shutter speed is the more star trails you will have. You need to find the balance between sharp and bright stars.  Change your camera's position periodically  Work with foreground images as well for contrast in the picture  Just keep at it and playing with settings. Take lots of shots at each setting. Usually you will not see what your image really looks like until you get back to your computer and process them. What does not work you can delete.  This is great fun. You will often be surprised at what you have captured when you process the images. You might catch a satellite moving across the sky with a long shutter speed, or a plane crossing the sky. Or a UFO. You just might be surprised.  Enjoy and keep practicing. The more you practice the better you will get at it.  I took these in Latvia a year ago late at night by a lake out in the boonies. I set shutter speeds from 1 second to 10 seconds. The shorter the shutter speed the sharper the stars . The air was humid and the elevation was almost 1 meter. I used a 100mm lens and a 300mm lens. As you can see I caught some airplanes in some of the images. As soon as I can get to a place that is dry and dark I will get clearer images. Also, Latvia is quite far north and the days are very long in the summer. To have a longer window of opportunity for shooting I would need to wear really warm clothing and get out in winter. In a desert climate it would be much easier than in northern Europe.  "}, {"upvote": 6, "content": "The exposure in this image is 30 seconds at f/2.8, with ISO 3200. The picture was taken with a full-frame DSLR camera (a Canon 6D) and a 16mm lens (extreme wide angle). You can compare this with the results that you want to get and adjust accordingly. Obviously you will need to put your camera on a tripod for such a long exposure, so you don't get motion blur.  One thing you should know is that if you make the exposure longer, you will get star trailing because the stars move across the sky due to the earth's rotation. If you want the trailing, then great. If you don't want star trailing (as in this image), then you need to observe the rule of 500, which says that your exposure time in seconds times the focal length of your lens should not exceed 500. In this case, 30 seconds times 16mm focal length gives 480, so I am within the limit. If you're really picky about even a little bit of trailing, you may want to observe a rule of 400 instead, to be more conservative. If you have a crop-factor camera whose sensor is smaller than the standard 35mm full-frame sensor size, then you will have to use the 35mm equivalent focal length rather than the actual focal length for your rule of 500 calculation.  One other practical hint: You're going to discover that focusing is a real challenge, because the scene is too dark for auto-focus to work, and there's hardly anything bright enough in view to see in your viewfinder to focus on. My strategy is to use manual focus with the camera's live view mode, and try to find the brightest star in the scene and focus on that. It will take some practice to get the hang of it.  You can see that the high-ISO capabilities of today's digital cameras bring Milky Way photography into the realm of practicality, but you do need a camera with a decent-sized sensor to do it \\u2014 you aren't going to be able to get these results with a mobile phone camera."}, {"upvote": 39, "content": "Milky Way shots are deceptively easy to pull off.  Here's all you need to take photos like this:  1. A camera : you'll need one with manual control 2. A tripod : you'll be using exposure times around 20\\u201330 seconds, so a tripod is a must 3. A wide, fast lens : for the best results, you will want the widest angle lens you can find. I generally use a 14mm lens. Also, you want the fastest lens you can find, meaning something with a low F number. F2.8 and lower works best. And that's it!! I will add that a shutter release will help so that you don't have to actually touch and jostle the camera, but it's not absolutely necessary.  Before I go into the specific steps, I should mention that this works best if you get as far away from cities as possible. There is a lot of light pollution from street lamps and whatnot that will hide the Milky Way. Also, I recommend trying to go out on a New Moon night when there is no moon in the sky, as the light from the moon can blow out the stars.  To find the Milky Way, I recommend using an app called Photo Pills or a desktop application called Stellarium. They will both help you find where the Milky Way will be on a given night.  So let's get down to the steps for shooting the Milky Way:  1. Aim your camera, mounted on the tripod, at the Milky Way. You'll want to put your camera into manual focus and focus to infinity, because in the dark your autofocus won't work very well. We focus to infinity because, well, the stars are really really far away. 2. Dial your camera settings to maximize the amount of light getting in to the camera. Here's what that means: put your camera in manual mode and set your f number to the lowest it can go to. 3. Put your ISO around 3200 to start, but you'll have to mess with this a bit. The higher your ISO goes, the more noise or grain will be introduced into your photo. It's different for every camera, but 3200 should give you enough exposure without entirely destroying the image with noise. I would recommend searching your menu for \\\"long exposure noise reduction. Without getting too technical, this will basically follow up your shot with a longer processing time. Don't wanna try to explain it here though. 4. Heres where it gets kind of tricky. You want the longest exposure that you can do, 30 seconds on most cameras. Here's the problem: an exposure that long will cause the stars to appear as tiny streaks, because the earth is rotating. Use the rule of 500 to determine how long of an exposure you can do: divide 500 by your focal length (full frame equivalent), and that is your shutter speed. Mess around with it a bit. 5. Trip the shutter. You should be able to see the Milky Way! Astrophotography is obviously a very intricate art, so there are many things that I didn't mention here that you will have to learn along the way, like noise reduction, foreground blending, stacking, and much more. With luck, this will be enough to get you started, and you'll be on your way to shooting the beauty that is our night sky!  Feel free to ask me questions in the comments!!"}, {"upvote": 21, "content": "The Milky Way spans much of the night sky. To even begin to get an interesting photo of it you're going to want a wide angle lens, not a telephoto. Something in the 14\\u201324mm range will do much better.  Then you'll need a dark, moonless night, a spot well away from city lights and any other light pollution.  After that, with the camera mounted on a nice sturdy tripod, you can begin to experiment with exposure. Set focus at infinity *( turn off ALL auto focus and auto-exposure. Set the ISO to 1600 and with shutter speed at 6 seconds, aperture at one click up from wide open. ( very few lenses are truly sharp wide open), point your camera at an area if the sky that obviously is showing the characteristic glow of the Milky Way, use the auto timer to release the shutter so you don't physically jiggle the camera, and then preview what you got.  Higher ISO will show more stars AND more sensor noise.  Longer shutter speeds will begin to show star trails.  Since the Earth is in continual motion, something along the lines of a barn door tracker will greatly increase how long you can expose without getting star trails.  Astro photography software will allow you to take many many photos and stack them to increase signal to noise issues, and see more stars than in any one shot.  Good luck! There is a fair amount to learn! Astro photography is nothing like terrestrial photography!"}, {"upvote": 132, "content": "Sports photographers need a few things that Canon dominated in the early days of DSLRs. These include:  Super fast telephoto lenses. When you see those distinctive white lenses in a crowd, that's Canon. Well, Sony's copied that look on a few of their lenses, but seriously, if you're using a Sony body at a pro sporting event, you're probably using the Sony A7 mark II or, soon enough, the new Sony A9 with a Canon lens and adapter. Maybe. Lots of people are working to make Canon lenses work great on Sony bodies.  Anyway, those are lenses like a 300mm f/2.8, a 400mm f/2.8, a 600mm f/4.0, etc. Some of these cost as much as an economy car, but they're in-demand by sports shooters.  Next comes high speed shooting, and after that, autofocus. Both of those pretty much started here, with the Canon EOS 1-N RS, in 1995. This camera shot 10 frames per second with no viewfinder blackout\\u2026 with film! And autofocus! In 1987, Canon had dumped their old lens mount and camera system for the all-electronic EOS system, and it was showing distinct advantages over the competition in this area.  The 1-N RS used a pellicle mirror, a non-moving transparent mirror, to achieve this speed. My first Canon EOS camera was an EOS RT which used the same technology, and could burn through film faster than your reaction time.  Canon's autofocus system improved with every new model in the early days of EOS, and it attracted sports photographers away from other brands throughout the 1990s. You can understand how these three factors combined in this one shot. The long telephoto with wide aperture is what gets you that nice shallow depth-of-field, separating the players from the crowd. There was only time to compose, not time to pick the perfect moment, not time to focus\\u2026 any mistake and you've missed the moment or have them out-of-focus as well.  This was followed up by digital versions, the EOS 1-D, the 1-D mark II, etc. All of these were flagship cameras designed for fast shooting. Today's EOS 1-D X mark II can shoot 14 fps (16 fps with the mirror up), buffers up 170 raw shots before writing to memory, and sports 61 autofocus points. There are other cameras that are faster. Both of them are mirrorless, not DSLR, and were introduced in the last year.  And finally, support. If you go to any major sporting event, there's a Canon Professional Services depot with replacement gear. Some stadiums have these permanently set up, otherwise it's a pop-up for that event. Canon makes very reliable gear \\u2014 other companies do as well. But for the folks shooting pro sporting, their income depends on getting THE shot. Canon's support keeps those shots coming.  Certainly other brands offer these features as well. If you look at any pack of spots photographers, the white lenses are probably Canon, the black lenses probably Nikon. Nikon was behind on autofocus for a decade or so, and that pushed Canon into a substantial lead. Once a smart company takes a critical lead, they work hard to keep it, and make every other company fight over second place."}, {"upvote": 16, "content": "Yes, it is possible. Largest aperture of f3. 5 is not bad. Set your camera on tripod, use manual mode, f3.5, shutter speed 15 seconds and ISO 1600. Do not use longer shutter speed because it will start trailing of stars.

I made a significant investment about this time last year in capital expenses by refreshing nearly all my camera gear. Although the R5 specs looks positively juicy, I'll need to realize a return on investment for the gear I purchased last year to justify any expansion. 2. Even though I did jump on the mirrorless bandwagon last year with the purchase of two EOS-Rs, it's very rare that I'm willing to become a beta tester for gear that hasn't been thoroughly field tested by the public. I know nothing as to the true performance of this camera so I'll wait for a MkII or MkIII before jumping in. 3. I'm slowly but surely cycling out all my EF kit, and replacing them with RF kit. But my workhorse cameras are still currently EF so my expenditures need to focus on moving equipment out of the pipeline before adding new camera bodies in- given the current economic climate, that will likely be a while. I am happy to see that Canon has doubled down on the RF lens platform. They kinda gave up with their micro-four-thirds M series, and anyone that bought in to that platform suffer because they bought BetaMax and not VHS\\u2026  On a side note- I believe that DSLR days are limited. The DSLR exists because the single lens reflex camera, even with it's janky shutter curtains and flip-up mirror, was a solid, predictable platform on which to build new digital technologies. Now that full-frame mirrorless has arrived, I think the DSLR days are numbered."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "NOT buying the Canon EOS R5, and here's why:  I have tens of thousands of dollars invested in my current system, all based on Nikon cameras and lenses. I simply can't justify \\u2018jumping ship' to a different camera or system despite the power and quality of the R5.  That is likely the overriding reason why MANY veteran photographers won't consider the Canon R5, because it's just not the camera that matters, it's everything else that fits in the camera manufacturer's ecosystem. As good as the Canon R5 may be, it can't hold a candle to my Nikon gear unless and until I am willing to add a similar collection of Canon lenses to the equation. Even at that, there are certain features and aspects of Nikon cameras/images/equipment etc. that I have learned to prefer over anything else out there.  A photographer with a sizeable investment in Sony, Fuji, or Panasonic gear is likely to have the same point of view, preferring to stay with what they know, love, and already own, than go through the process of ramping up another system.  Other factors are at play too:   * I've been buying cameras long enough to know that the major manufacturers play a constant game of leapfrog, each in turn introducing \\u2018breakthrough advances' that the other manufacturers eventually adopt, adapt, and add. It's really only a matter of time until everything that puts the R5 head-and-shoulders above the current competition is available on other manufacturers' models. (Think in-body stabilization, for example.) And, it's only a matter of time before someone else comes out with something that makes the R5 (or any other breakthrough camera) look out of date.  * Even now, Nikon is teasing its customers with the imminent release of the Z 6II and Z 7II, which both boast big improvements in video, focusing, frame rate, dynamic range, and processing power. It's enough of an upgrade to cause most Nikon shooters who might be considering a switch (to Canon or Sony) to have second thoughts. Canon, Sony, all of them do something similar, rolling out incremental improvements that make it far tougher for their current owners to abandon their current brand.  * The system a serious photographer chooses goes so deep that it becomes scary to even think about the big switch. It's not just bodies and lenses. It can include memory cards, card readers, batteries, extension tubes, teleconverters, filters, cables, flashes, flash triggers, even Photoshop/Lightroom presets!  * Whenever the unending battle over features rears its head, I try to remember that the weakest link in my photo system isn't any shortcoming in the camera, lenses, or associated gear. The weakest link is me. I'm the one who makes most of the mistakes, compromises, shortcuts, and misjudgements that impact the images I ask the camera system to create.

My 5D mark II and 7D are still in service and I feel no need to retire them either. They still take fantastic photos.

A buddy has one and we had a little fun shooting a crazy happy puppy around the backyard. Him with the R5 and me with a G9. He couldn't tell the difference when we threw the motion shots on the computer. I couldn't either but never care about precision. Both can shoot at 20 frames per second and produce really great results. The bottom line is he has the money to invest in the R5 system and I'm too cheap.

Why?  Because I shot with two Canon 5D Mk4 bodies and when the EOS R was released I immediately jumped on the bandwagon of those who dismissed the EOS R because it didn't have dual card slots.  But a friend of mine bought the EOS R (shortly after it was first available) and kept telling me how great it was, especially the accurate autofocus. I listened to what he said and it sounded great but I couldn't get over the lack of dual card slots.  We were working together on a promo shoot project and he brought his EOS R along and let me try it out.  I was immediately impressed with how well the EOS R felt in my hands. I never cared for the feel of the Sony bodies, this body felt like I could see myself using it. Mostly I was impressed with the autofocus performance. We tested autofocus through a 10-stop ND filter and it was fast and accurate.  I thought about it for a while and finally came up with some workaround solutions to the single card slot and felt comfortable (comfortable enough) to use the EOS R with its single card slot. I ordered my first EOS R and read the Advanced User Guide almost all the way through by the time it arrived.  The EOS R arrived on a Friday night and the next day I used it to shoot Metropolitan Fashion Week and it was great. Because it was so similar to every other Canon body I've owned it wasn't too much of a stretch to start using it right away.  After hearing all the stories about poor battery life I found it was much better than expected. I always use a battery grip and I brought extra batteries just in case since I had never used this camera before. Using the battery grip (two batteries) I shot 2,122 images at Metropolitan Fashion Week and 1,735 of those were with the 70\\u2013200mm f/2.8L IS II which uses battery power for image stabilization. At the end of the night I still had 50% battery power remaining.  -  After using the EOS R at a couple weddings I ordered a second body and battery grip so I'd have two matching bodies rather than shooting with the EOS R and 5D Mk4.  -  There are many things about the 5D Mk4 bodies that I missed when using the EOS R and it seems like most of those will be addressed in the EOS R5. I got up early and pre-ordered my EOS R5 at 5am so I could get it ASAP.  Do I care about 8k video? Not in the slightest. Do I care about 4k video? Not really, but maybe someday.

Ethereum waaay in the lead. Networkeffects significant forward momentum now almost impossible to stop."}, {"upvote": 13, "content": "Throughout 2015\\u20132017, several projects raised funds to develop general purpose smart-contract blockchain platforms, owing to 1) perceived market demand; 2) technical differentiators they might develop; and 3) expected challenges Ethereum might encounter.  It quickly became apparent that building novel smart-contract platforms is exceedingly complex, and nearly all platforms experienced significant delays (including ETH 2.0). Today, some of the most anticipated platforms are finally on the cusp of deployment.  Here's an overview of some upcoming projects:  DFINITY  DFINITY aims to build a decentralized Internet Computer [ https://dfinity.org/ ], where they would enable the public Internet to natively host backend software, transforming it into a global compute platform. Internet services would then be able to install their code directly on the public internet and dispense with all servers, cloud services, and centralized databases.  There are many implications to this idea, notably revolving around decentralizing the web [ https://blog.coinbase.com/the-biggest-challenge-of-the-consumer-web-and-how-crypto-is-poised-to-solve-it-5de2ab5b1c4a ] and enabling open innovation, but also creating a path to autonomous software such as open versions of Facebook or LinkedIn. As a side-effect, it may also carry potentially improved security models and remove IT complexities and costs, among other things. If successful, this would be a powerful paradigm shift in how the internet operates.  To accomplish this, DFINITY has assembled a strong team of technologists and published some breakthroughs [ https://medium.com/dfinity/dfinity-white-paper-our-consensus-algorithm-a11adc0a054c ] in consensus mechanisms to enable larger throughput (Threshold Relay).  Polkadot  Polkadot targets building an interoperability network, aiming to enable blockchain projects to:  1. Trustlessly transfer assets between different chains; 2. Enable cross-chain smart contracts that can interact with each other; and 3. Provide a framework to quickly spin up application-specific chains that can be used by other blockchains. Interoperability is a key building block for the crypto ecosystem. By way of example, it could enable crypto-kitties to create a specific blockchain with massive throughput (so you can breed those kittens as fast as you want), but your crypto-kitties could be accessed by Ethereum, and your platform could use ETH, Dai, or any other ERC-20 token (or possibly ETH infrastructure) natively.  The early days of web servers may be a helpful analogy. Back then, a single server hosted several web pages. If any page exploded in popularity, it slammed the whole server and took down all other web pages with it. The internet evolved to segregated, application-specific servers enabling each web page to scale as needed, without impacting anyone else. Replace web pages with blockchains, and this is just one aspect of what interoperability and application specific chains might do for crypto.  Polkadot is led by Gavin Wood (one among of Ethereum founder) his approach is conceptually similar to Cosmos [ https://cosmos.network/ ], but differentiated in how his interoperability network handles security.  NEAR Protocol  NEAR is similar in vision to Ethereum 2.0: A proof-of-stake, sharded blockchain with smart contract functionality, but with a twist in consensus design that better protects composability \\u2014 or the ability for smart contracts to seamlessly interact with each other across shards. Coinbase Ventures [ https://ventures.coinbase.com/ ] is an investor in NEAR.  The NEAR team, a collection of ICPC medalists [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest ], believe targeting dapp developers is critical to long-term traction and are emphasizing the developer experience. Their goal is to launch a truly scalable chain with seamless developer tooling and with a built-in ETH \\u2192 NEAR bridge so end-users can still use ETH tokens (and possibly ETH infrastructure), which would lower barriers to adoption.  In essence, NEAR is similar to ETH 2.0 but built on a new chain and new environment, thus forfeiting some of the significant network effects ETH has acquired. NEAR is planning a launch in Q2 this year.  Takeaways  Each ETH competitor also faces an uphill climb competing against the strong network effects Ethereum has accrued around infrastructure, tooling, distribution, and mindshare.  In the end, each new protocol's launch is simply the beginning of a much longer journey. And in the long run, these networks could add new functionality to the wider crypto protocol layer, broadening the crypto design space and increasing the potential for impactful dapps.

The only jutsu SOSP Naruto got hit and tanked was just a Base Chidori.  As for SOSP Madara, he tanked 8th gate Gai's attacks, Sage Art: Lava-Style Rasenshurinken(not completely tho), Six Path Rasengan and Chidori. But got destroyed by Gai's Ultimate Kick and cut through by Sasuke's Chidori Blade.  And this:   %3E Naruto Durability %3E Chidori %3E Chidori Spear %3E Madara Durability This is the most BS biased opinion.  By that Logic, Sasuke's base chidori would be far stronger than Night Gai's Ultimate Kick. Lol. That's BS too.  If SOSP Madara tanked Six Path Chidori easily, a Base Chidori would be nothing for him. Some said it was meant for sealing, not for damaging or piercing. Well, it is only half-right. In fact, Six Path Chidori has both of them(both sealing and piercing damaging). Would you guys think fodders like Kakashi and Asuma would tank Six Path Chidori because it was just meant for sealing? Lol. Some fanboys are so pathetic.

Actually, Naruto had his chance to show the durability against Lighting Fang. But he dodge it rather than take it. But I'm sure it will penetrate SOSP Naruto's body anyway. But SOSP Naruto will heal the wound anyway too.  So, Let's just do power scaling.  Naruto has Half Kurama Mode and SOSP and Frog SM. Madara has Full Juubito Mode, SOSP and Hashirama's Senjutsu Sage Mode. So, even though Madara has significant edge over Naruto, let's just assume that they have almost the same durability.  So, at best possible, the strongest attack Naruto would fully tank might be Night Gai's physical punch. Naruto won't fully tank Lava Rasenshurinken just like Madara(Naruto will probably die from it bc of no regeneration).

Yes Naruto gets incredibly fast etc but every second Naruto moves visibly slower, Isshiki even states that Naruto's punches aren't doing physical damage. Its the draining affect that is the problem.  This for me is not the mode Naruto should use vs Madara, Madara doesn't have 20 hours to live like Isshiki did, Madara also has a juubi. I personally think Baryon mode is not affective vs Juubi Jins, they have hyper regen, incredible life force and they have TSO's they can hide in. Naruto in Baryon Mode cannot touch TSO's since he's not using Hagoromo's power or six paths senjutsu. Baryon Mode burns Kurama's life force but Kurama is nothing compared to the juubi so Kurama's life force will drain before the juubi's does.  Also Naruto can't block infinite tsukuyomi, Naruto also cannot fly in Baryon mode, neither is he using six paths senjutsu so Madara will ruin him, he can't sense limbo without six paths senjutsu or sage of six paths mode so I just don't see it's effectiveness.  So Naruto will ultimately lose in this form. Baryon Mode was a cop-out, it just appeared when the opponent happened to have a limited time left. Its not really useful if your opponent has high durability, regen and life force. I don't know why they used Baryon mode like this, they could've easily just had it as KCM3. Naruto using all of Kurama's 100% of chakra in one condensed format around his body just for combat, or they could've had six paths senjutsu and the above, instead of Naruto using Hagoromo's chakra, Kurama's and the bijuu over the entire duration of the fight like vs Kaguya they could've just condensed all that power into mere minutes to give him higher strength than before.

He's shown thinking ahead like preventing Naruto from using Shadow Clones and forcing him on the defensive.  Or my favorite example of Sasuke being how he absorbing Kurama's chakra so he would deplete Naruto's and gain some. They always think they like this which is how they always seem to always have a way to oneup each other.  Sasuke was absolutely destroying Naruto in there first fight at the valley but once Naruto used kurama he got his ass kicked.

Outside of that, there is little reason for concern. The rating is not a reflection of a hard limit in the camera, it is simply a rating for how long the shutter is expected to last. Sometimes they fail sooner due to some unforeseen damage. Sometimes they last well beyond that rating. Most people will never have a camera long enough to have to even worry about hitting it. They either replace the camera well in advance, or they just don't use it enough. For scale, I once had an 80D that I sold after two years of really putting it to use for sports and wildlife, as well as events and portrait work. It had 18,000 shots on the shutter when I sold it. At that rate, it would have been 10+ years to hit the 100,000 shutter rating on the camera. That's as a pretty serious user too, a casual user probably doesn't even take 18,000 shots in 10 years.

It is the artist inside you who makes the difference. A good photographer makes the same picture stand out because of the skill. The camera is like a chisel and hammer in the hands of a sculptor.  The DSLR gives you option to control shutter speed, aperture, ISO, exposure compensation, metering mode, focusing point, and many other things that is not always possible with smartphone cameras or P&S. You should get comfortable with the camera features and how each control affects the picture. There are many articles, vlogs, etc., on this. There are even courses and workshops.  You should learn the art of composition, perspective, angles, light, getting colour, mood, etc. I will recommend that you attend some courses and workshops. You should learn how to shoot in RAW, and using manual controls and then the techniques of post processing. I come from film days where it was so difficult:   * Cost of raw film, processing, took their toll on the pocket  * There was no way we could review our picture. We needed to be perfect.  * We, the budget constrained, had to be careful with exposures. We did not always have the luxury of shooting at even 2 fps, leave alone 5\\u201310 fps continuous modes of today.  * A bad exposure meant an opportunity lost. With DSLR all these problems have vanished, so to speak. But I find many beginners buy an expensive DSLR (even the most basic entry level model is expensive) and then use the AUTO or SCENE or P (Program) mode to shoot. This is just such a terrible waste because then you are not going to learn and you may as well have spared the expense.  My advice to beginners:   * Set the camera to Auto ISO.  * Start with Aperture Priority mode (A on Nikon, Av on Canon). This mode forces you to set aperture, whereas camera sets the shutter speed and ISO. This mode is most suited for genetic photography including landscapes and portraits.  * If shooting sports and fast action, change to Shutter Priority (S in Nikon, Tv in Canon). This mode forces you to set shutter speed while camera does the rest.  * Gradually learn about ISO and then start tinkering with it.  * Learn about exposure compensations (Ev) and try changing that.  * Find out what matrix metering, centre weighted metering and spot metering do, where they help, etc.  * Finally switch to Manual or More mode where YOU TELL the camera what to do.

Now, with that being said, there aren't actually very many feats that we can use to gauge his power lmao.  Here is what we do know:   * Water Release: Water Dragon Bullet requires 44 hand signs to perform, but Tobirama only needed to make 1 hand sign.  * Tobirama can use water style techniques without the presence of any water.  * As a member of the Senju Clan, Tobirama has vast and potent chakra reserves (the more potent ones chakra is, the more powerful their techniques will be).  * He is seen (in both the manga and anime) utilizing Water Release techniques uniquely, such as covering a battlefield in water, cutting through targets, and creating water senbon.  * An extremely weakened Edo Tensei of Tobirama produced a Water Style: Water Wall that was strong enough to counter The Third Hokage's Fire Style: Fire Dragon Flame Bombs technique.  * Again, as only an Edo Tensei, Tobirama produced a Water Style: Water Shock Wave that flooded the battlefield, and required a massive Mud Wall by Hiruzen to counter.  *   * It should also be noted that (where, in other techniques, the water disappears) this technique maintained the presence of its water.  * Tobirama was then able to shape this flood water into tendrils and drag Hiruzen underwater after catching him off guard .   * Created a Water Style: Water Dragon Missile that was strong enough to counter a Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu from Izuna Uchiha, who is said to be relative in power to Madara before the latter obtained the EMS.  The only Shinobi that has shown feats comparable to these is Kisame. Many even argue that Kisame has stronger water style jutsu.  But I digress. Of course, we have many, many, many other water style users from Naruto to Shippuden to Boruto.  And there aren't any Hax feats from the Otsutsuki Clan and Co. that we can use to diminish Tobirama's power yet.  But Tobirama's versatility, chakra reserves, and chakra potency should allow him to dish out some pretty destructive jutsu, and they do allow him to.

That's more than insane! Thanks a lot everyone!  First we must understand that Tobirama lived in war. He was born in it, molded by it, he didn't knew peace until he was already an adult, and I totally didn't rip that off from Bane.  Every jutsu he created was aimed for war, later categorized as Kinjutsu because it was either too dangerous, or simply immoral.  The Kage Bushin  It is meant to replicate fighters in order to confuse the enemy. The problem is that every clone halves your chakra, and not every ninja can have a good performance with his chakra halved. Even master ninjas like Kakashi only use it every now and then. Certainly the only characters that can use this as a normal method are Naruto and Boruto, the first because he is very proficient with it, and the second because he is just used to fighting that way.  Hiraishin  The flying thunder god jutsu is one of the greatest movement techniques in the whole Narutoverse, second to none in long range. The reasons for it's development are unclear, but it's probable that it was either created as a method of fast transportation, or a weapon to be use in the war against the Uchiha, who could react to pretty much everything with the sharingan.  The problem with this Justu is that it's borderline impossible to be used. Only two people have mastered it of the five people that we've seen using it, Tobirama and Minato. But to understand why is it labeled Kinjutsu we must look at the other three: Genma Shiranui, Raid\\u014d Namiashi and (apparently) Iwashi Tatami. To know why they matter so much, you must know that this guys were given pretty simple task: Protect the Hokage, and later, to protect the feudal lords. This guys are among the TOP shinobi of Konoha. They could even stand against the sound four and their curse mark, without any type of power up or hidden jutsu that we know of. It takes the three of them to use they flying thunder formation, and what they can teleport is limited. Any shinobi that is, in some way, less than Kage, could never use the technique. My assumption is that the quantity of chakra control needed to use this space time jutsu is gigantic, not apt for everyone. This, and the fact that it seems the user needs to be a sensor to be able to use the seals.  Finally, but not less important, the edo tensei.  The Summoning: Impure World Reincarnation, was created as a way to cause as many casualties as possible without having to risk your own party. The armies are at best diminished in numbers, but also, whoever survives gains a huge psychological burden: they just had to fight againt their comrades, maybe loved ones, maybe people they spent nights and days with. And this later is the very reason why it's a Kinjutsu, it's the highest immorality, to play with human lives and souls."}, {"upvote": 34, "content": "Sarada STOMPS!!!

"}, {"upvote": 41, "content": "You pretty much only find very high megapixel image sensors in cameras systems: Canon and Nikon, Sony and Hasselblad, etc. The very point of a camera system is that one size doesn't fit all. A 12 megapixel, a 24 megapixel, and a 50 megapixel sensor can each do a fine job, but they don't necessarily do exactly the same job.  The first really high resolution full-frame DSLR was the Canon 5DS/5DSR. These went to 50 megapixel before the mainstream full-frame cameras had even quite made it to 24 megapixels. Why? Well, in part because there are already a proven demand for 50 megapixel cameras in the medium format market. It's a wise move if you can either attract customers away from a potential competitor or prevent your own from going to that competitor.  Business-wise, another thing was already clear about the DSLR and, really, the whole camera market: there would be less reason to keep replacing your DSLR with a new model, year after year, because digital cameras were becoming mature. To boost sales, most camera vendors have done what they can to sell the same photographer more than one body in each generation. That inherently means some specialization.  Some applications really benefit from more resolution. You're not shooting action, such cameras are slower than their lower resolution alternatives, but they capture more information in every shot. This is applicable to landscape photography, images which might be printed large. And fashion or ad photography, photography that may wind up on billboards.  Of course, there are work-arounds \\u2014 not everyone needs a 50 or 100 megapixel camera. For example, I shot yonder photo of Sedona with a 16 megapixel Olympus E-M5 Mark II Micro Four Thirds camera\\u2026 it's just made up of 30 separate images. If I had my tripod, I could have shot that \\u2014 an essentially motionless subject \\u2014 in the camera's 64 megapixel hires mode, which would create raw files based on eight separate photos and shifting the sensor.  What do you give up with a high resolution? As you suggested, light sensitivity, as long as you're comparing sensors made from the same sensor technology. When Sony introduced their A7R Mark II, it had a 42 megapixel BSI sensor, the first in a full-frame sensor. It was in some cases outperforming their A7 Mark II 24 megapixel model. Sony also makes the A7S, which is a 12 megapixel, video-oriented full frame mirrorless. The 4K video frame is about 8 megapixels, you don't need any more resolution, and so you can make larger, mode sensitive photodiodes, deeper charge wells, and deliver an overall more sensitive camera.  However, in the A7 Mark III, Sony introduced a 24 megapixel BSI sensor, which compared pretty favorably to the special purpose A7S Mark II. We have not seen the A7S Mark III yet, so there's an awfully good chance that Sony's doing exactly what you're after, making a lower resolution, more sensitive sensor.  I could claim that the 20\\u201324 megapixel range is what most photographers are going to want at present. If you don't need 50 megapixels, you're spending lots of extra money on storage, or shooting at an interpolated resolution, only rarely using the full capability a high resolution sensor and suffering in low light. By the same measure, not everyone needs a super low light model with lower-than-standard resolution, at least if you're shooting stills.  And since Canon and Sony launched these lines, we've seen Nikon do likewise, with the D750 and D850, then the Z6 and Z7. One 24 megapixel sensor, one 45 megapixel sensor. And Panasonic's also launching their L-Mount system with the 24 megapixel S1 and 47 megapixel S1R. So clearly, there is a market for higher resolution sensors.  Here's a photo I took over the weekend. The finished version is 18 megapixels, shot with my 20 megapixel Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark II, but the original is acutally a 6-shot composite at 47 megapixels. In this one instance, I suppose I could have captured the whole image with that Panasonic S1R or Canon 5DS. But either way, the freedom to crop is kind of useful, and that's another reason some folks like the higher resolutions.  Others might cry lazy composition\\u2026 and they have a point. Thing is, for me, I was on a 5 mile hike when I shot this, and the rest of the group just keeps going. Two of the big reasons I switched from Canon to Olympus is the size and speed of these cameras. When I have more time I certainly take it, but even then, before I sold my Canon system, my typical bag for a hike had 15\\u201325lbs of gear. That was just too much, short of a super low light shot on a tripod, the same image quality. Yeah, my Canon 6D was also 20 megapixels. I've never really felt the need for more\\u2026 or, really, to stick to 3:2 or 4:3 images. The photo should take up all room it needs."}, {"upvote": 80, "content": "The number of pixels tells you the spatial resolution of the camera's sensor. That alone doesn't really tell you all that much about image quality.  Together with the sensor size, the pixel count can give you a hit. But all else being equal, the color resolution will be inversely proportional to pixel count, while noise will be proportional to pixel count. Smaller pixels in the same area, more noise per pixel, less dynamic range.  Consider a 20 megapixel full frame camera versus a 48 megapixel smartphone, such as those made with Sony's new IMX586 sensor chip. The pixel size on that chip is 800nm across. The pixel size on the full frame camera is around 6600nm across\\u2026 nearly 70x the light gathering ability per pixel. Photos are made from light. And the weakest link is often not the sensor, capturing that light, but the lens, focusing that light.  The Lens  Strangely enough in this age of everpresent photography, consumers concentrate on the sensor's pixels, ignore the color resolution, and most oddly, ignore the lens itself. Thanks to lens design and diffraction, it's not certain that your actual effective optical resolution will be all that close to your sensor resolution. For example, there are many low to midrange point and shoot cameras with 20 megapixel sensors, but the effective optical resolution through their f/3.0-f/3.5 lenses are probably more in the 12-14 megapixel range. That's at the wide angle setting\\u2026 by the end of the zoom range at f/5.6-f/6.3, you may be lucky to have an effective 6 megapixel shot.  And that just considers diffraction. The lens design may further cripple the image. You didn't really image that the $3.50 plastic lens in your new smartphone compares to a $1,000-$5,000 professional lens, did you? Each lens has a minimum feature size, the finest resolution that it can provide. For the same image quality on that aforementioned 48 megapixel phone, you need a lens that's a whole 8x sharper than your full frame lens, for which you are willing to pay about 1/500th as much money.  Long before digital cameras, lens designers used resolution charts like this to determine the practical resolution of a lens, and when shot on film, a lens/film combination. Despite their analog nature, every lens has a limited resolution, a limited bandwidth to use the equivalent term in analog design. Lens designers would publish a resolution measured in line pair per millimeter. Since it takes a minimum of two pixels to generate a line pair (one black, one white), you actually can get a digital equivalent meaure of any optical system, whether digital or film. And that's one way to tell if your camera is actually delivering what you think you paid for.  A Good Lens is Designed for the Sensor!  So let's take an example: I have a lens that's measuring 150lp/mm\\u2026 that's a good lens. For a 35mm image, which is 36mm x 24mm, that translates to 5,400lp x 3,600lp. The lowest resolution digital sensor that can represent that would be 10,000 x 7200 pixels, or 72 megapixels. So you could use this lens on your 40\\u201350 megapixel full frame camera and pretty sure the limits are not your lens. In fact, that's probably pretty good for the next generation of 60\\u201375 megapixel cameras reportedly coming soon!  However, a lens at 50lp/mm would yield 1,800lp x 864lp, 3,600 x 1,728 pixels, or about 6.3 megapixels. So with that lens, you're not going to see any real difference between your 12 megapixel, 24 megapixel, and 50 megapixel full frame cameras.  What if we put that first, very excellent lens on an APS-C camera, a sensor size of 23.7mm x 15.60mm. That gives us 7,110 x 4,680 pixels, or 33 megapixels. That's pretty good for APS-C today, which tops out at around 26 megapixels, and the near future: Sony's got the IMX510 on the way, a 32 megapixel APS-C sensor. That other lens, however, would be completely worthless as an APS-C lens.  What about 1\\u2033 camera? Sony, Canon, Panasonic, and others all sell pretty nice compact digital cameras with 1\\u2033 chips\\u2026 Nikon even made a mirrorless system, the Nikon 1 System, using that smaller (13.20mm x 8.80mm) chip, but it was ended last summer. So that's now cropping at 3,960 x 2,630 pixels, or 10.4 megapixels. So that absolutely stellar lens for 35mm/full-frame is kind of a super low quality lens, as-is, for our 1\\u2033 consumer pocket cameras. Clearly, one must engineer a lens differently for smaller cameras than larger cameras. The lens doesn't have to cover the same image, but it's got to have a dramatically higher linear resolution.  And in fact, it's unlikely to help as you get too small. None of those high resolution phones are getting anything near a real-world 48 megapixels. For one, you'd need an f/1.2 lens or better. The fastest lens on a smartphone right now is f/1.5, and that's made for an even smaller sensor. One of the big limits of building a phone camera is the fact your phone isn't a phone, but a pocket computer, and most users won't accept much of a compromise in form for that computer. So a thicker lens is out of the question. In practice, you probably won't see much beyond an optical resolution of 30-something megapixels in bright light, drop down to 12 megapixel in lower light. They are far too noisy for late day or indoor use in full resolution.  A Note to APS-C Users  Think about this for a few minutes. If you're a Fujifilm APS-C user, no problem. Your lenses are designed for your sensor size. But consider Canon, Sony, and Nikon, who sell both APS-C and Full Frame lenses. But look closely, and you'll find very, very few higher quality lenses designed for Canon, Sony, or Nikon APS-C bodies.  Well, we just buy the high quality full-frame lenses is what you'll probably be saying at this point. Yeah, that's what I did, too, back when I had Canon gear. But then think about this: when Canon put out the Canon 5DS, their 50 megapixel full frame DSLR, they published a list of lenses that were recommneded for that resolution\\u2026 because they had never had a camera with that resolution. In fact, that was better than twice the resolution of the best professional 35mm films. In fact, a large number of even Canon's L-series had never been designed for the possibility of that much resolution. I was actually happy to discover I had several lenses on that list\\u2026 not that I had the budget, but still, nice to know.  Here's the thing\\u2026 in APS-C form, you need a 19 megapixel sensor to match the pixel density of Canon's 50 megapixel monster. That's right \\u2014 all of those APS-C models, like my old Canon 60D, the Rebels, the 7D, so many 18 megapixel sensor cameras Canon made for years were basically pushing the limits on their optical design. No wonder you got such a better result with a full-frame. And today, most of Canon's and Nikon's are 24 megapixels. That's 62 megapixels on a Canon full frame, using the same pixel density (a bit less on a Nikon, since Canon uses a smaller APS-C sensor than everyone else)!  So in short, you're kind of locked into consumer-grade in Canon, Nikon, or Sony APS-C, almost regardless of the glass you buy. Because no one's making top lenses for APS-C on these cameras. That's also why Fujifilm users get results much closer to full-frame: they're using lenses designed for the sensor they have!  User Error  Now, all that said, yes, one's ability to use the equipment is also a factor. Premium smartphones these days employ pretty good AI to essentially allow anyone to pick up the phone and get a decent shot. That's leaving all of the technical issues to the phone's AI, leaving you to worry about the creative aspects of photographic composition. Best case, you get a really good photo, it goes out online, people view it on their 2K-4K screens and maybe have not the slightest clue you shot it in 12 megapixel on a phone rather than 50 megapixel on an expensive full-frame camera.  And sure, it goes the other way as well. Your typical professional system camera doesn't hold your hand too much. Yes, some of the best sensors out there offer more forgiveness than smaller chips, much less compact digital and phone camera chips. So some people do get away with weaker technique using an expensive camera.  And sometimes, they don't get away with it. I saw a video awhile back of a photo enthusiast comparing one of the better pro/enthusiast cameras to his iPhone. He was actually getting better results with the phone! His conclusion: phones were starting to surpass big cameras in image quality\\u2026 amazing! My conclusion: he was fairly clueless on setting exposures, he kept exposing way too far to the right. User error, regardless of megapixels.  When I say expose to the right, that's in reference to a histogram. There's a school of thought that tells you to move your exposure as far to the right \\u2014 as far into the highlight/bright part of the histogram \\u2014 as you can without losing anything. That results in more light being captured, shadows being lifted, and in general, it helps keep low level noise out of the image.  However, if you do expose too far to the right, you blow out your highlights and lose information. Your iPhone, your Google Pixel, etc. are not going to do this. A good camera will have far more latitude here than your phone or a P&S, but if you blow out your highlights or crush your shadows (too far to the left), all that extra color and image resolution in your expensive camera won't make up for setting a correct exposure. Which is what that AI in your phone is doing, maybe even stacking multiple shots to get around the limitations of its sensor chip.  So, to answer your question in summary, it can be user error or lack of knowledge. It can also be the limitations of your hardware, of your lens or your camera's color resolution. A good photographer will master any camera and get good shots, but that's not one single thing. That's setting the exposure correctly. That's shooting in raw, so that digital darkroom processing actualy works correctly. That's actually doing that post-processing work on the image after exposure, dodging and burning, delivering the best version of that photographic intent possible. That's selecting a subject appropriate to that camera's abilities.  Knowing what to do gets you a better photo with a worse camera pretty much every time. But that worse factor is simply not about megapixels. In fact, in everyday view-on-the-web experiencing of photographs, once the camera's at 8\\u201312 megapixels, you're golden. Other issues will prevail. Unless you have a habit of pixel peeping, the camera resolution is not what you'll see as important."}, {"upvote": 33, "content": "Megapixels don't matter.  But in the most phone or camera advertisements, you may think they're the most important factor for camera quality. They highlight the megapixels of the camera, no other specifications.  A megapixel is a measure of resolution i.e. 1 million pixels.  Megapixels are only useful when you have to print the image. Like on a large size paper or more.  Other things that do matter are   * Sensor Quality (low noise, high dynamic range, and so on - all of which get better with a large sensor)  * Lens Quality (sharpness, quality of bokeh etc)  * Camera Firmware, i.e. ability to use RAW format, or create JPEG files with good quality. Also, it's important to understand that lighting plays a HUGE role in how the photo turns out.  Hope this answers your question.

It radically alters how we build applications online and makes it possible to applications previously not possible.  Ethereum, one of the most talked about blockchain platforms, is competing to become the next generation foundation for building applications. However, it is now under threat from what has been described as the Ethereum killer.  EOS, is the latest blockchain platform out of the blocks. It is causing a stir amongst blockchain experts, who are super excited by its potential. Analysts say it is will make other blockchain platforms obsolete.  Here are 5 reason why EOS might make Ethereum obsolete  EOS has superior technology compared to Ethereum  EOS was developed after the proliferation of multiple blockchain experiments like Ethereum. All of them attempt to lure in developers, enterprises and users to their platform. Unfortunately, the limits of their technology are a drag on what is possible.  Ethereum, suffers a limitation of transactional throughput. Because of a process known as serialization, transactions on it are limited to being processed sequentially. Therefore, all processes that go through its blockchain, cannot be processed simultaneously. Instead, they have to be processed in the order they are received relative to other transactions.  The EOS platform, recognized this limitation, and solved it by implementing asynchronous communication and parallel processing of transactions. This means multiple transactions running on EOS do not have to queue and wait their turn. Rather, they all get processed together, simultaneously on a distributed network. This is a remarkable feat in transactional capacity.  With this capability, EOS can handle more transactions, scale faster and to a wider audience than what is possible with Ethereum.  EOS can process more transactions per second than Ethereum  For blockchain platforms to become successful, they need to accommodate a ton of traffic on their network. The number of transactions a network can handle per second is a metric for comparing blockchain performance.  At its peak on June 11th, 2017, Ethereum experienced one of its highest traffic on the network. Unfortunately, even at its peak, it could only handle a throughput of 5.2 transactions per second. In the cryptocurrency world, this may seem impressive. However, for commercial grade applications, it is merely a drop in the bucket. With hundreds of banks, governments and major companies looking to build blockchain applications, much more is required.  EOS identified the folly of the current blockchain transaction capacity models. So they have implemented asynchronous communication and parallelization. With parallelization, multiple transactions are processed simultaneously, enabling horizontal scalability of the network. In addition, EOS has adopted Graphene technology, which has been proved to achieve 10,000 - 100,000 transactions per second.  Combining both technologies, EOS can achieve a modest 300,000 transactions per second. But, this is only the beginning. The road map is to scale to process 1 million transactions per second. EOS will support the bandwidth requirements of commercial and enterprise grade applications. For context, facebook and google handle about 52,000 and 40,000 transactions per second respectively.  Mass adoption of blockchains boils down to the scaling ability of platforms. EOS has scalability at the core of its design.  EOS has zero transactions fees while Ethereum's fees are going higher  Blockchain networks typically consume resources for security and processing. The de facto approach has been to pay the owners of resources. Miners collect fees from users to keep the network running. This design however, is detrimental to lowering the barrier of adoption.  The Ethereum blockchain enables developers to build decentralized applications at no cost. The downside is users pay the price for consuming the network's resources. Users of Ethereum applications have to pay fees for every transaction processed by miners. Every storage operation, bandwidth use and calculation has to pay gas fees which is expressed in Ether. The amount of fees is calculated based on the complexity of the transaction.  If users do not pay enough fees, their transactions are excluded. It is worse because fees can change at any time and there is no way to predict in advance.  EOS was built from the ground up to do away with this insane model. To onboard users en mass, it needs to be cheap to use applications on platforms. For this reasons, transactions on EOS incur zero fees. This model eliminates the hassle of purchasing cryptocurrency to pay network fees. Additionally, developers also do not incur any cost to run applications on EOS. All they need, is to hold a certain number of EOS tokens that assures them a preset allocation of bandwidth.  EOS's zero fee approach to onboarding users and developers on its platform is by far superior to Ethereum's pay to use fee model.  EOS's Daniel Larimer has more experience building blockchain versus Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin  Blockchain's are a relatively new technology, that combine decades worth of prior art. It takes years of experience programming in different fields and a big picture view of the future to build one.  Vitalik Buterin, was barely out of high school when he set out to build the Ethereum blockchain. He started out as a cryptocurrency writer for Bitcoin magazine and opted not to go to college. 14 months later, he joined teams working on digital assets protocols - Mastercoin and Coloured coins.  While on these projects, he witnessed first hand the limitation of protocols built on Bitcoin. So he conceived the idea of Ethereum, an independent blockchain in 2014, but lacked the developer skills to build it from scratch. He had to find other developers to help him make Ethereum a reality.  Dan Larimer on the other hand, graduated from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in 2003 with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science. He worked on various projects such as a virtual reality simulator and unmanned vehicle control systems.  In the early days, Dan worked closely with Satoshi Nakamoto refining bitcoin. He realized its shortcomings and moved on to build a high performance decentralized exchange known as BitShares. 2 years later, he built Steemit, a social media site powered by blockchain. Steemit is hailed as the most user friendly blockchain to date.  Dan's ground breaking technology Graphene was used for both Bitshares and Steemit. Both combined have more blockchain transaction activity per day than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitshares processes between 600,000 - 700,000 transactions per day, while Steemit handles 120,000 transactions per day.  As the CTO of EOS, Dan has brought his experience, lessons and technology from previous projects. EOS combines all the great qualities of Bitshares and Steemit to come up with a superior blockchain platform.  Final Thought  People don't realize that there are other ways to earn great profits on cryptocurrency rather than just buying them. For example, investing with trusted Non-Ponzi cryptocurrency investment companies for profits, companies like Cryptobond (www.cryptobond.tech) pay double your cryptocurrencies (Ethereum, EOS and others) in 7 days of investment, isn't that great?  Developers, entrepreneurs, Banks, fortune 500 companies and governments have expressed interest in building blockchain applications. Current blockchain platforms such as Ethereum are limited in scalability, fees and throughput. They were not designed from the ground up with commercial applications in mind. Attempting to do the major changes necessary now is like trying to disassemble an engine while it is running  EOS is building a blockchain platform for scale, ease of use and millions of transactions per second. It is incorporating the lessons and failure of existing blockchain models. With an eye on the future of commercial adoption, EOS has a leg up on Ethereum, by building to remedy the failures."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "EOS has a substantial blockchain size issue that appears to me to doom it.

I almost gave up too until i came across CryptoFXnetwork Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www . cryptofxnetwork . com) where i get profit on my invested cryptocurrency after 10 trading days. Don't be left out. Be like me. I still believe in Cryptocurrency. Please Note: This is me just telling you about my personal experience so far so good about investing on the only legit cryptocurrency investment platform i have seen online, I am in no way trying to advertise or give you a financial advise on how to spend your money. You can make your research and if you find the platform deem fit then you can go ahead just like i did.  When it was first launched, the price of the EOS cryptocurrency sat at $2.29. However, it then doubled in less than 24 hours, with EOS hitting $5.40.  This hike did not last, however, and the coin soon started falling, breaking one support level after another. EOS found its bottom at $0.59, which is where it remained until late October 2017. Once the crypto bull run that marked the year reached its peak, EOS joined the rally, and it skyrocketed to $16.39 on January 13, 2018.  However, while most coins peaked around this date or earlier, EOS' all-time high came later, in April 2018. In mid-April, the crypto market \\u2013 which had been crashing since January \\u2013 started seeing a new bullish wave. Prices started going up, and many assumed that the so-called 'crypto winter' was over.  These days, we know that the surge in April was only the eye of the storm, as the crash continued as May 2018 arrived. But, for those few weeks, the EOS price jumped once more, breaking its former record, and going up to $22.89. This was the coin's highest price, and it has never reached these highs again, at least so far.  Following this second surge, EOS kept dropping, briefly stopped by support here and there, but eventually, it dropped to its new bottom at $1.86 around December 7, 2018. In 2019, the coin saw gradual growth, although it progressed slowly, and everything it had achieved by mid-2019 was undone in the second half of the year, as it slowly returned to the level where it sat ever since \\u2013 between $2 and $2.8.  The EOS price has fluctuated in this range, except for on three occasions in 2020. The first one was between mid-January and mid-February, when it joined another bull run that took it to $5.35. The second was in August 2020, when it hit $3.7, and the last one is right now, led by Bitcoin (BTC), which is once again approaching its all-time highs at $20,000.  EOS, on the other hand, is as far away from its own record as it can be, hovering around $3.26.  What is happening to EOS these days?  Unfortunately, EOS has not been making headlines in 2020, as the crypto industry is mostly focused on the decentralised finance (DeFi) sector. When DeFi started slowing down, bull runs took over, and most of the attention went to Bitcoin.  However, that does not mean that EOS has been doing nothing. Its developers at Block.one recently announced the EOS Resource Model proposal, and the soon-to-arrive review of various talented organisations that responded to the company's invitation to evaluate their code.  Block.one also recently expressed its pleasure with how Spielworks built a rewards and loyalty platform for gamers using EOSIO.  The company also worked on adding new features to its Training and Certification segment of the blockchain.  And, of course, as a development platform, EOS has also been making moves to attract people to develop new DeFi projects on its network. The network already has quite a few successful projects, although the majority of the developers are still focusing on developing DeFi on Ethereum.  EOS price prediction 2021: what to expect from EOS going forward?  Lastly, we arrive at the most interesting part \\u2014 EOS coin price prediction for 2021 and beyond.  According to TradingBeasts, the EOS price in December 2020 will reach a maximum of $3.4, after which the forecasting service expects it to drop back down to $2.7, on average.  In January 2021, its EOS crypto price prediction shows the coin remaining near this level, at around $2.7, later expecting it to experience a slow but steady rise throughout the year, with the coin having the potential to hit a high of $3.9 next December. The average price of EOS is predicted to reach $4.07 in December 2022, and then $5.03 in December 2023.  Wallet Investor also expects the currency's price to rise in early 2021, although their EOS coin forecast says that the asset will see a price crash in the second half of the year. The event will potentially lead EOS down to $1.2 one year from now.  As for CryptoGround, they have a very bullish EOS prediction. In fact, their EOS forecast claims that the coin will simply keep climbing, with its value reaching $4.17 in six months, $4.7 in one year, and $21.4 by December 2025."}, {"upvote": 17, "content": "EOS has the following unique benefits.  \\u25cf High transaction throughput: EOS enables the execution of millions of transactions per second, which means that it has high transaction throughput.  \\u25cf Free transactions for end-users: EOS provides the users to mine and execute a large number of transactions without any additional fees.  \\u25cf Governance based on user votes: Each transaction executed in EOS is bound to follow the rules laid down in the constitution.

Tanks will never be obsolete because it's role is irreplaceable.  Drones cannot capture land, while tanks can. Tanks could literally fight inside a battlefield without any fuel and take a lots of punches, while drones can't.  Tanks could fire high explosives onto targets at a cheap cost, while drones needs $72,000 just to kill a grunt, when you could just machine gun the grunt.  Tanks deliver massive firepower at a low price, while drones can't.  Tanks work under the logic:  Big gun destroy everything  but enemy easily destroy big gun  so put big gun in fortification  but big gun no reach people  so put big gun on fortification that is moving  That simply doesn't work on drones. The ammunition used by tanks would cost around $2000, while missiles costs about $50,000. A massive difference.  EDIT:  I wanna try this:  Welcome to Quora's Unknown Battlegrounds(QuoBG), where I, write and analyze as if this is a game. No politics, no bias, purely about military technology.  On the previous part, I talked about fixed-wing UAVs, like this one:  But today, I wil talk about this type of drone as well. Photo Src.: Unsplash  These types of drones will still not make tanks obsolete. You can't just call drones everytime you want to blow up someone's room. A tank could fire at every single building it could see, while a drone needs to kamikaze.  Yes, there is a concept of kamikaze drone swarms armed with machine guns. But that cannot replace the role of a tank, which centers around it's big gun.  Unlike the previous type of drone, these drones are readily available in the market. Civilians could buy it, making it a perfect starter for new drone players.  They could easily drop cheap grenades, IEDs, etc. with sufficient accuracy, and attack silently. Efficient, and easy to handle as well.  Any new player could perform well with this drone.  They could drop this on enemy infantry players, and eliminate an entire squad.  This type of drone could also enter and clear rooms if equipped with a firearm, fire control system, and extra maneuverability. A bit of an expensive upgrade, but worth it.  Against tanks, they would be super effective ambushers. They could appear out of windows, or pop out of cover from rubbles. The roof mounted machine gun would also have a hard time shooting such a small and nimble target.  The player could equip EFP IED. Explosively Formed Penetrator.  [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosively_formed_penetrator ]Then the penetrators would be facing downwards.  The drone could then simply land on the top of the turret, where the armor is weakest, and penetrate the tank.  Such a weapon would make a good tank hunter.  HOWEVER  This will not keep tank players from not using tanks. If your objective is to kill as much enemy players as possible, tanks would be the top choice.  Quadcopter drones would most likely be kamikaze-like, and single use.  If your teammates are dying of overwhelming firepower, and in need of a lots of firepower, a drone will mostly not give a significant damage. A tank could keep giving immense fire support for several hours or days, even without ammo for it's main gun, for it has two more guns.  One note, is that tank players, and their teammates also learn.  They certainly will create anti-quadcopter-drone measures.  The enemy could use jammers so that the player will lose control over the drone. Photo Src.: Military and Aerospace Electronics  A drone gun, which also does the same thing. Photo Src.: Military Times  And even net guns. Photo Src.: Wikipedia  Some drones have feature wherein they will return to their owner once disconnected or jammed. However, this could reveal your position, and lead to your doom.  Other drones could be autonomous to counter jammers. However\\u2026  Their efficacy at the moment is still questionable.  The autonomous upgrade is still on progress. The AI must be able to identify friend or foe first. As for the movement, we could use lidars which could tell the AI where the wall is and how far it is.  Robot vaccum cleaners already uses lidar to know where the wall is. Photo Src.: Yanko Design  The only problem is that the one used by quadcopters must pierce through the immense clutter of the battlefield, and still know how far the wall is.  In conclusion,  Quadcopter drones cannot deliver a significant, sustained firepower. However they will make a perfect weapon for insurgent and guerilla status players.   * Good for ambush? Silent and small, YES  * Could deliver a quick pain in the ass? YES  * Is cheap? ABSOLUTELY  * Makes a good hit and run? YUP  * Good for attrition? YES. Wreck tanks one by one.  * Annoy or instill fear among the enemies? YES As for a conventional force. They make good recon and scouts, or even forward observers. However, do not expect them to change the tide of a fierce gunfight. As I said, they cannot deliver sustained firepower, only a quick burst.  Yet, they will make a good weapon of attrition.  They are a deadly force against tanks, but this is not enough to make tanks obsolete.  EDIT: WHILE TAKING A BATH, I HAD ANOTHER INTERESTING THING THAT CAME INTO MY MIND\\u2026  The days of conventional war is over, and asymmetric warfare is what's left.  That's right! Package delivery drone. Photo Src.: Loss Prevention Magazine  A commander player could use drones as a way to deliver relief goods. This could increase the morality of your troops, increase charisma points of your team, and reduce the turning-to-the-dark-side rate of the local population, without risking any lives.  HOWEVER\\u2026  The enemy side could use this against you by becoming total assholes, and delivering deadly packages such as bombs, poison, diseases, etc., disguised as toys, and framing your side. Which is very bad.  TO COUNTER THIS\\u2026  Infantry may go directly into the area.  A UN soldier giving a medical checkup. Photo Src.: United Nations Peacekeeping  Aside from being much harder to tamper with, like the one at the drones, this also has a larger charisma points in return.  Yet in some situations, you might not have the luxury to be able to go to them. In that case, you could use drones. But if the enemy side also uses drones, I am not sure if they will greet the drone carrying an innocent package nicely.  In that case, you could bring, not a tank, but an APC.  UN Soldiers on board an APC. Photo Src.: United Nations Peacekeeping  However, if the path towards the civilian area is very hostile, that's when you could bring a tank, or an IFV.  In conclusion,  Quadcopter drones could deliver relief goods with much ease, and also at a very low cost. However, bringing players to the locals has a much larger impact, but also has it's risk. To mitigate the risks, you could do it on safe, controlled, or cleared areas. While drones could be used to deliver to areas that is surrounded by threat yet, or is still unreachable.  One possible example is the DMZ of the two Koreas. You could slingshot USBs, hard drives, etc., containing kpop songs and kdramas, or smuggle choco pies, to increase defection rate, and increase your charisma points.  However, you will not have the luxury to go directly pass the border and do some relief operations or so. So you may use drones. Just make sure that the enemy commanding players under the North Korean faction won't be a dickhead and kill their own civilians by using drones as well, and then frame you."}, {"upvote": 185, "content": "Cassar points to new technologies presenting opportunities in his interview with The Malta Independent, noting that Malta faces important tests including the first International Monetary Fund (IMF) Financial Sector Assessment Programme for Malta since 2003.

Cassar says it's wonderful, but that a blockchain revolution of business and government could still be years away because many barriers would need to fall in.

CRYPTOCURRENCIES \\u2013 A THREAT TO FIAT CURRENCIES OR THE TRADITIONAL ROLE OF BANKS?  Cassar believes there is little evidence to suggest that cryptocurrencies are a threat to fiat currencies in the short or medium term however he does believe they are a threat to banks:   %3E Their traditional role as main payment intermediary for funds and currency transmission will become challenged, if not obsolete. He explains that many banks are steering clear of cryptocurrencies because of their novelty, as they are not conventional legal tender, or backed by a central bank and present the risk of money laundering.  Other banks he says, are taking advantage of the opportunity by advising on ICOs, providing crypto-tracker funds, custody services, and taking a more open stance. Though it will be a risky road, Cassar is optimistic about the future of cryptocurrency:   %3E Cryptocurrencies are here to stay and, just like the early days of the internet which created a furore because of lack of regulation, once regulation and education improve and banks gain more confidence, some may reap first-mover advantages. On the emergence of technology companies gaining banking licenses to operate in the sector and take advantage of new financial technologies Cassar quotes Walter B Wriston from 1981:   %3E The belief that a market is yours by some divine right is an old dream. Companies that fail to change become tombstones in the corporate graveyard. NO OPTION BUT TO INNOVATE  In the face of the new technologies that cryptocurrencies and blockchain represent, if banks want to stay relevant, they have no option but to innovate. However, current banking innovation is costly with no exclusivity, which is making way for fintech firms to lead innovation.

I almost gave up too until i came across CryptoFXnetwork Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www . cryptofxnetwork . com) where i get profit on my invested cryptocurrency after 10 trading days. Don't be left out. Be like me. I still believe in Cryptocurrency. Please Note: This is me just telling you about my personal experience so far so good about investing on the only legit cryptocurrency investment platform i have seen online, I am in no way trying to advertise or give you a financial advise on how to spend your money. You can make your research and if you find the platform deem fit then you can go ahead just like i did.  When it was first launched, the price of the EOS cryptocurrency sat at $2.29. However, it then doubled in less than 24 hours, with EOS hitting $5.40.  This hike did not last, however, and the coin soon started falling, breaking one support level after another. EOS found its bottom at $0.59, which is where it remained until late October 2017. Once the crypto bull run that marked the year reached its peak, EOS joined the rally, and it skyrocketed to $16.39 on January 13, 2018.  However, while most coins peaked around this date or earlier, EOS' all-time high came later, in April 2018. In mid-April, the crypto market \\u2013 which had been crashing since January \\u2013 started seeing a new bullish wave. Prices started going up, and many assumed that the so-called 'crypto winter' was over.  These days, we know that the surge in April was only the eye of the storm, as the crash continued as May 2018 arrived. But, for those few weeks, the EOS price jumped once more, breaking its former record, and going up to $22.89. This was the coin's highest price, and it has never reached these highs again, at least so far.  Following this second surge, EOS kept dropping, briefly stopped by support here and there, but eventually, it dropped to its new bottom at $1.86 around December 7, 2018. In 2019, the coin saw gradual growth, although it progressed slowly, and everything it had achieved by mid-2019 was undone in the second half of the year, as it slowly returned to the level where it sat ever since \\u2013 between $2 and $2.8.  The EOS price has fluctuated in this range, except for on three occasions in 2020. The first one was between mid-January and mid-February, when it joined another bull run that took it to $5.35. The second was in August 2020, when it hit $3.7, and the last one is right now, led by Bitcoin (BTC), which is once again approaching its all-time highs at $20,000.  EOS, on the other hand, is as far away from its own record as it can be, hovering around $3.26.  What is happening to EOS these days?  Unfortunately, EOS has not been making headlines in 2020, as the crypto industry is mostly focused on the decentralised finance (DeFi) sector. When DeFi started slowing down, bull runs took over, and most of the attention went to Bitcoin.  However, that does not mean that EOS has been doing nothing. Its developers at Block.one recently announced the EOS Resource Model proposal, and the soon-to-arrive review of various talented organisations that responded to the company's invitation to evaluate their code.  Block.one also recently expressed its pleasure with how Spielworks built a rewards and loyalty platform for gamers using EOSIO.  The company also worked on adding new features to its Training and Certification segment of the blockchain.  And, of course, as a development platform, EOS has also been making moves to attract people to develop new DeFi projects on its network. The network already has quite a few successful projects, although the majority of the developers are still focusing on developing DeFi on Ethereum.  EOS price prediction 2021: what to expect from EOS going forward?  Lastly, we arrive at the most interesting part \\u2014 EOS coin price prediction for 2021 and beyond.  According to TradingBeasts, the EOS price in December 2020 will reach a maximum of $3.4, after which the forecasting service expects it to drop back down to $2.7, on average.  In January 2021, its EOS crypto price prediction shows the coin remaining near this level, at around $2.7, later expecting it to experience a slow but steady rise throughout the year, with the coin having the potential to hit a high of $3.9 next December. The average price of EOS is predicted to reach $4.07 in December 2022, and then $5.03 in December 2023.  Wallet Investor also expects the currency's price to rise in early 2021, although their EOS coin forecast says that the asset will see a price crash in the second half of the year. The event will potentially lead EOS down to $1.2 one year from now.  As for CryptoGround, they have a very bullish EOS prediction. In fact, their EOS forecast claims that the coin will simply keep climbing, with its value reaching $4.17 in six months, $4.7 in one year, and $21.4 by December 2025."}, {"upvote": 5, "content": "Let's take a look at what EOS is aiming to do - EOS's CTO, Daniel Larimer, claims that no blockchain platform can provide the performance that ordinary people want. He claims that ordinary people are more concerned with performance than with decentralization. Larimer's goal with EOS is to develop a platform for decentralized apps that works the way users want them to.  This results in Ethereum being their main competitor! Compared to Ethereum, EOS is attempting to make it easier to develop dApps. EOS is said to require less code than Ethereum because it has more basic capabilities and is easier to learn how to use and navigate. This is critical because the majority of people lack the technical skills required to utilize Ethereum.  HOWEVER - The case to be made about Ethereum is that it is led by a VERY strong development team which is headed by our lord and saviour - Vitalik. The man is a legend and has delivered on just about every promise they made. Ethereum is slowly moving to PoS (proof of stake), which is an amazing move, and there are other good things coming to Ethereum as well.

A new kitchen and new bathroom definitely add value, but cost/benefit not that much. If you put 30k into a new awesome kitchen you may increase the value if your home by only 25k.

A nice lawn, fresh paint, nice landscaping, and a white picket fence maybe. That will add a lot of value or at least make the prospect have a great first impression.

It is a decentralized platform based blockchain and enables the users, organizations, and different entities to develop, and execute commercial-scale distributed and decentralized apps. (DApps) using same platform.  It is different from both Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of its design paradigm and technical implementation.  The term EOS has no officially declared full form. Moreover, the creators of EOS have also decided not to define this acronym and use it as it is formally. BlockOne has developed it; whereas, its core developer is BM (Daniel Larimer).  EOS has the ability to support all core and fundamental functionalities required by different businesses to enable themselves along with other people to make blockchain-based DApps in a similar fashion so that of the web-based applications.  These applications are hosted with functionalities like safe and sound access and authentication provisioning, permission, usage management, data hosting, and smooth communication between the end-users, DApp, and the Internet.  The EOS blockchain aims to build such a platform that can perform millions of transactions per second. These transactions are to be performed without any additional cost.  In EOS, blocks are produced by Block Producers, just like miners produce them in Ethereum. Once the blocks are generated, they are being paid by EOS blockchain instead of the users paying for them.  EOS blockchain system has a built-in inflation system that helps in the maintenance and proportion of an ecosystem. In EOS, two blocks are produced simultaneously every second.

If you're in a neighborhood of 50,000 dollar houses, sorry, you can't spend 40 grand on a kitchen. It won't return as much as it costs. Don't aim to be the most expensive house on the street.  Second, the highest returns will be on fixing flaws. If the house is pretty nice except it still has granny's 1959 kitchen that's where you spend. If your neighborhood has high parking demand and you only have one space, look to double the driveway, add to the garage, or add a pull-off. If there is no dishwasher that's a flaw. No over the stove microwave, flaw. Window ac instead of central, flaw.  Third, maybe the flaw isn't fixable, like being on a noisy road or next to a fast food joint. At least diminish it, like triple-pane windows on that side, a berm, a fence, and/or bushes. If you have a yard where grass doesn't grow, switch to a low water landscape plan that doesn't use grass. Diminished flaw.  Fourth, first impressions count. The front entrance should be boldly colored, attracting the eye. It should be widely framed, well-lighted, and easy to approach. The front door lock should be smooth and easy to operate. Remember that the showing agent will be keying in through that door. The driveway and sidewalk should be powerwashed. Landscaping should make the yard look big, no clutter  Fifth, the thing that always adds way more value than cost is paint, inside and out. Make an empty canvas with your paint with very light shades and completely white ceilings. The art and furnishings are the color not the walls.  Sixth, finished basements don't pay. They have low ceilings, inadequate windows, noisy mechanicals, and most people after spending money on finished basements discover they barely use them, too dark and too separate from the main quarters. The exceptions are if you are fixing the flaw of way too little square footage, have a walk-out basement with daylight windows, or can add a bath, kitchen, and outside entrance for a Mother-in-law type or even legal separate unit. Mostly I like a very light finish in basements. Just make the space bright, clean, and very sparsely furnished. A big empty space is appealing to buyers. They can imagine their own use. Don't clutter it with a pool or ping pong table. Maybe lay down a light colored rug but not wall to wall carpeting. If the house has the flaw of too few bedrooms then finishing half the basement might pay. You might need to dig out a window well to be an emergency egress, otherwise by building code it's not a bedroom. Besides then you have some natural light.  Seventh, don't exceed conforming use. If most houses in the neighborhood are three bedroom then paying for a fourth bedroom adds less than its cost, and adding a fifth is so non-conforming it adds 1/10 the cost of building it. The exceptions are when you get it cheap. Say for example you are building a detached two car garage (in part because nearly all your neighbors have large garages and yours only has a small one car attached. That's a flaw. See number two above.). Turning the old garage into a bedroom cheaply could add more than it costs. If you are in a two bed house in a three bed neighborhood you are fixing a flaw, see number two above.  If you are in an affluent area of 3000 sf homes and you have 1900 sf then an addition could pay, but you don't have to go big. Get up to 2500. I've been in big houses with tons of wasted space, little hallways here, there, everywhere. It's ok to trail the average a little. Be efficient.  Eighth, a light remodel can do wonders. Maybe in a bathroom after painting I'll replace a faucet, the curtain rod with one of those curved ones, and the light fixture with a multiple bulb LED. It's not a gut-to-the-studs renovation, but it can freshen up the space considerably.  Ninth, perception is value. For example I personally don't think radon is near as dangerous as most people do, but I know their perception affects value. So when buying a house I test for radon, get a clause in the contract, and do the mitigation. I know I'm going to sell some day. Those that perceive a problem will let it affect their desire to buy and willingness to pay more. I'd rather nip that in the bud so when they test for radon it comes in below the 3.9 pico-curie action level. Flaw fixed. For the same reason I remove lead pipes and buried oil tanks. When I go to fill out the seller's disclosure form when it comes to lead pipes and oil tanks I check the box no. Flaw fixed.  Things that make it more saleable add value. If it's appealing that's value.  Also if by clever decorating you can make a space \\\"feel\\\" bigger then that's perception. It works on real estate brokers and appraisers too. There's room for subjective shading adjusting values for the CMA.  Tenth, value is determined by buyers not sellers. If you have a pencil to sell and ten possible buyers in front of you then the value is whichever buyer will pay the most. If you have one hundred buyers then whoever among them willing to pay the most determines the value. If your pencil is odd, like a strange color or only is comfortable for lefties, such that nine of ten buyers would reject it then you have a non-conforming property that will take longer to sell and get less money.  There is no absolute value. If you spend 40 grand on a stupidly designed kitchen you can't hold a gun to the buyer's head and demand your money back. You have to be smart but humble, with understated style, conservative (but not cheap) in spending on improvements, and put yourself in the buyer's shoes.  All the advice above is pretty standard stuff. Most good appraisers and brokers will agree, but I do want to add one little thing that's different. I like a little hook, something memorable. If a couple of transferrees are being squired around to ten houses on a Saturday by a rookie agent I want them to remember my house for something interesting or amusing, a theme perhaps, like dolphins, an interesting piece of art, a water effect in the yard, or just anything that'll make them say something like The House with all the Pumpkins instead of 123 South Maple Avenue. I want to stand out a little, be memorable.  I hope this lengthy answer is helpful and concise. I also have written about priorities in building a house and how to stage a house for sale. I welcome feedback in the comments. I would love to learn something new and make a change to my advice.

Without a doubt, the answer is 100%, YES.  Here are some fundamental reasons why Litecoin ($LTC) will increase in value this year:  1. Segwit, Lightning Network, and Atomic Swaps. [1] These are just some of the few technological developments that Litecoin Foundation and Charlie Lee are working on to make sure $LTC is a coin utilized for daily micro transactions. I will stand by what I say over and over again: Charlie Lee's best decision is making sure Litecoin is a companion to Bitcoin rather than a competitor. I'm fairly certain there are a few Bitcoin billionaires that agree with Charlie's stance. Think of Bitcoin as the $100 bill and Litecoin as the $20. There is a need for both currencies. 2. LitePay. [2] LitePay which is expected to launch on February 26, 2018, will facilitate transactions and allow you to accept payments through Litecoin, store and spend and even convert $LTC into dollars. [3] 3. Fast Transactions & Growth. It takes about 2 minutes to make a transaction with Litecoin while you can expect a much longer wait time with Bitcoin. Charlie Lee is also more concerned about Litecoin's usage than its market cap. People need to use Litecoin for it to succeed. He's focusing on what's important when everyone else is crying about why they're not overnight millionaires. Like or dislike his tweets, Charlie Lee is one of the most talented, respected, and connected people in the cryptocurrency space. His words matter and affect price, which is why he had to donate his shares of Litecoin to charity. Without ownership of the coin, he cannot be accused of insider trading. Something is brewing for Litecoin and it's only a matter of time before we see what that is.  Finally, let's not forget that Litecoin began 2017 at $4.33. It's current price as of the writing of this post is $181.88, a 4,100% increase! It is unlikely that you would see this kind of return in the traditional stock market; I don't why know people aren't more estactic about what Litecoin has already done. If Litecoin just does a paltry 10x increase this year, it's year-end price would still be $1,810!   1.

The Ethereum network could almost be described as application-agnostic, i.e. it is specifically designed as a neutral platform for all potential applications. In this way, as stated by the Ethereum Design Rationale document on github: Ethereum has \\\"no features\\\", refusing to build in \\\"even very common high-level use cases as intrinsic parts of the protocol.\\\"  %3E Another significant difference between EOS and Ethereum is in the blockchain consensus mechanism and overall blockchain governance approach. Whereas Ethereum uses Proof-of-Work (and will soon switch to hybrid Proof-of-Work/Proof-of-Stake), EOS will use Graphene technology that utilizes the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPOS) consensus mechanism.  %3E In order to consider a platform as commercially viable, scalability is of utmost importance. This is one key area where EOS and Ethereum will differ. Currently, the Ethereum network is limited by the single threaded performance of a CPU. Early test networks achieved 25 transactions per second (in somewhat optimized conditions), which could likely be increased to 50 or 100 tx/s with optimizations. However, under load from real applications, the current transaction limit of the Ethereum network is likely 10 tx/s or less.In the past, the network has been overwhelmed and overloaded with transactions to the point that all but the highest-fee transactions were rejected. Note that Vitalik Buterin has laid out a roadmap to \\\"unlimited scalability\\\" which heavily relies on the concept of sharding. As far as I understand (which is NOT well), sharding is a technologically challenging concept that certainly increases the complexity and attack surface of the network, and potentially lowers the security of the network.  However, in terms of scalability, EOS will have two significant advantages over the Ethereum network, and once implemented, EOS will likely be on the only platform that can handle truly commercial-scale decentralized applications.First, EOS will rely on Graphene technology, which has been shown in stress tests to achieve 10,000-100,000 transactions per second. Secondly, EOS will use parallelization to scale the network, likely up to millions of transactions per second. If these benchmarks are realized, EOS should be able to support thousands of commercial scale DAPPs. EOS will use asynchronous communications and separate authentication from execution to achieve speedups, and because it will have no transaction fees, EOS also does not require counting operations.  %3E Related to the scalability of the network, it is also important to discuss potential attack vectors to the network. In this chapter, I will briefly discuss the potential for denial-of-service type attacks. This type of attack is when a malicious attacker spams a network with traffic in order to prevent legitimate traffic from getting through. It is my understanding that the Ethereum network has been proven to be vulnerable to such DOS attacks, while EOS should be invulnerable to such attacks.  %3E Essentially, this is a comparison between and ownership model and a rental model. With Ethereum, gas fees are required in exchange for every calculation, storage operation, and bandwidth utilization. Furthermore, the required fees fluctuate and can spike prohibitively high as miners preferentially select transactions with the largest fees.  In contrast, EOS will utilize an ownership model, in which holding EOS tokens gives users a proportional share in the network bandwidth, storage, and processing power. This means that if someone owns 1% of the EOS tokens, they will always have access to 1% of the network bandwidth, regardless of the load on the rest of the network.

It radically alters how we build applications online and makes it possible to applications previously not possible.  Ethereum, one of the most talked about blockchain platforms, is competing to become the next generation foundation for building applications. However, it is now under threat from what has been described as the Ethereum killer.  EOS, is the latest blockchain platform out of the blocks. It is causing a stir amongst blockchain experts, who are super excited by its potential. Analysts say it is will make other blockchain platforms obsolete.  Here are 5 reason why EOS might make Ethereum obsolete  EOS has superior technology compared to Ethereum  EOS was developed after the proliferation of multiple blockchain experiments like Ethereum. All of them attempt to lure in developers, enterprises and users to their platform. Unfortunately, the limits of their technology are a drag on what is possible.  Ethereum, suffers a limitation of transactional throughput. Because of a process known as serialization, transactions on it are limited to being processed sequentially. Therefore, all processes that go through its blockchain, cannot be processed simultaneously. Instead, they have to be processed in the order they are received relative to other transactions.  The EOS platform, recognized this limitation, and solved it by implementing asynchronous communication and parallel processing of transactions. This means multiple transactions running on EOS do not have to queue and wait their turn. Rather, they all get processed together, simultaneously on a distributed network. This is a remarkable feat in transactional capacity.  With this capability, EOS can handle more transactions, scale faster and to a wider audience than what is possible with Ethereum.  EOS can process more transactions per second than Ethereum  For blockchain platforms to become successful, they need to accommodate a ton of traffic on their network. The number of transactions a network can handle per second is a metric for comparing blockchain performance.  At its peak on June 11th, 2017, Ethereum experienced one of its highest traffic on the network. Unfortunately, even at its peak, it could only handle a throughput of 5.2 transactions per second. In the cryptocurrency world, this may seem impressive. However, for commercial grade applications, it is merely a drop in the bucket. With hundreds of banks, governments and major companies looking to build blockchain applications, much more is required.  EOS identified the folly of the current blockchain transaction capacity models. So they have implemented asynchronous communication and parallelization. With parallelization, multiple transactions are processed simultaneously, enabling horizontal scalability of the network. In addition, EOS has adopted Graphene technology, which has been proved to achieve 10,000 - 100,000 transactions per second.  Combining both technologies, EOS can achieve a modest 300,000 transactions per second. But, this is only the beginning. The road map is to scale to process 1 million transactions per second. EOS will support the bandwidth requirements of commercial and enterprise grade applications. For context, facebook and google handle about 52,000 and 40,000 transactions per second respectively.  Mass adoption of blockchains boils down to the scaling ability of platforms. EOS has scalability at the core of its design.  EOS has zero transactions fees while Ethereum's fees are going higher  Blockchain networks typically consume resources for security and processing. The de facto approach has been to pay the owners of resources. Miners collect fees from users to keep the network running. This design however, is detrimental to lowering the barrier of adoption.  The Ethereum blockchain enables developers to build decentralized applications at no cost. The downside is users pay the price for consuming the network's resources. Users of Ethereum applications have to pay fees for every transaction processed by miners. Every storage operation, bandwidth use and calculation has to pay gas fees which is expressed in Ether. The amount of fees is calculated based on the complexity of the transaction.  If users do not pay enough fees, their transactions are excluded. It is worse because fees can change at any time and there is no way to predict in advance.  EOS was built from the ground up to do away with this insane model. To onboard users en mass, it needs to be cheap to use applications on platforms. For this reasons, transactions on EOS incur zero fees. This model eliminates the hassle of purchasing cryptocurrency to pay network fees. Additionally, developers also do not incur any cost to run applications on EOS. All they need, is to hold a certain number of EOS tokens that assures them a preset allocation of bandwidth.  EOS's zero fee approach to onboarding users and developers on its platform is by far superior to Ethereum's pay to use fee model.  EOS's Daniel Larimer has more experience building blockchain versus Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin  Blockchain's are a relatively new technology, that combine decades worth of prior art. It takes years of experience programming in different fields and a big picture view of the future to build one.  Vitalik Buterin, was barely out of high school when he set out to build the Ethereum blockchain. He started out as a cryptocurrency writer for Bitcoin magazine and opted not to go to college. 14 months later, he joined teams working on digital assets protocols - Mastercoin and Coloured coins.  While on these projects, he witnessed first hand the limitation of protocols built on Bitcoin. So he conceived the idea of Ethereum, an independent blockchain in 2014, but lacked the developer skills to build it from scratch. He had to find other developers to help him make Ethereum a reality.  Dan Larimer on the other hand, graduated from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in 2003 with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science. He worked on various projects such as a virtual reality simulator and unmanned vehicle control systems.  In the early days, Dan worked closely with Satoshi Nakamoto refining bitcoin. He realized its shortcomings and moved on to build a high performance decentralized exchange known as BitShares. 2 years later, he built Steemit, a social media site powered by blockchain. Steemit is hailed as the most user friendly blockchain to date.  Dan's ground breaking technology Graphene was used for both Bitshares and Steemit. Both combined have more blockchain transaction activity per day than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitshares processes between 600,000 - 700,000 transactions per day, while Steemit handles 120,000 transactions per day.  As the CTO of EOS, Dan has brought his experience, lessons and technology from previous projects. EOS combines all the great qualities of Bitshares and Steemit to come up with a superior blockchain platform.  Final Thought  People don't realize that there are other ways to earn great profits on cryptocurrency rather than just buying them. For example, investing with trusted Non-Ponzi cryptocurrency investment companies for profits, companies like Cryptobond (www.cryptobond.tech) pay double your cryptocurrencies (Ethereum, EOS and others) in 7 days of investment, isn't that great?  Developers, entrepreneurs, Banks, fortune 500 companies and governments have expressed interest in building blockchain applications. Current blockchain platforms such as Ethereum are limited in scalability, fees and throughput. They were not designed from the ground up with commercial applications in mind. Attempting to do the major changes necessary now is like trying to disassemble an engine while it is running  EOS is building a blockchain platform for scale, ease of use and millions of transactions per second. It is incorporating the lessons and failure of existing blockchain models. With an eye on the future of commercial adoption, EOS has a leg up on Ethereum, by building to remedy the failures."}, {"upvote": 291, "content": "In 2009, Bitcoin was introduced and not many people knew about it. Over time, when people learned about the decentralization from fiat money, they learned they can be more free. No more worrying about your money being frozen from big banks and intermediaries like PayPal. You are your bank now. However, Bitcoin got much bigger than most people thought and it did that very fast. With its increase in price so quickly, it has suffered an increase in transaction fees and also a slowdown in its transaction speed. However, it is still useful. When Ethereum came out, it was looked down upon because the market hadn't matured yet. No one understood much about cryptos beyond the peer to peer transfer. When the difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum was established, that is when we had a surge of the altcoin rush. This caused prices to skyrocket on all altcoins. It seems as if the roles have been reversed and there is more doubt on Bitcoin than anything else. This is why we recommend you hodl Ethereum over Bitcoin.  Before i continue, let me introduce you to a platform i discovered where you can sell your Bitcoin and other top Cryptocurrencies at the exact rate in dollars any where in the world. The website is IBUYCRYPTO (www.ibuycrypto.store). It is safe and secure. The interesting part of it is that, you don't have to drop your vital informations before you sell to them. You sell and get your money directly sent to your bank account immediately your deposit is confirmed. You can also sell and request the money is sent to someone else. Thank me later after using this platform.  What is Bitcoin Used for?  With Bitcoins increase in price, it has been dubbed as gold 2.0 because of its store of value like feature. It is the most expensive cryptocurrency and it actually has the highest market cap. Bitcoin has also been the most resilient. It has the ability to drive the market up or down. If people start taking money out of Bitcoin, expect the whole market to come down. The vice versa also happens. With Bitcoins recently mempool always being full along with the transactions being so expensive, people are looking for other routes. There are upgrades that are expected to fix this but it doesn't seem like it will be here anytime soon. This is called Lightning Networking and it will have an effect on many other cryptocurrencies too.  What is Ethereum Used for?  Ethereum was created by Vitalik Buterin and released in 2015. It is an open source public blockchain that lets people build on the blockchain. It can also be used a digital currency which it is at times. For example, if you decide to create an ICO with your own tokens, you will want people to buy your tokens somehow. You are thinking with a credit card but in cryptocurrencies, ICO's are traded and paired with Ether usually. This means 1 eth is equal to a certain amount of your tokens. You must send your eth to a specific ICO address and receive your tokens that way. This is becoming bigger and bigger as more companies are looking to raise capital through the crypto markets rather than venture capital.  Why Ethereum will do better in the long term?  The future of ethereum contains a lot more hopes than Bitcoin does. Creating another Bitcoin is much easier than it is creating an ethereum that is running efficiently. We have many other coins that are working better as a peer to peer transfer of digital currencies like Litecoin and Vertcoin. We have been seeing Bitcoins dominance in market cap dropping down and with Ethereums market cap going up. The new Weiss Ratings increased confidence in Eth also.   * More use cases: Ethereum has many more use cases than Bitcoin does. Not only can you use it as a peer to peer transfer but you can also use it to create your own ICO. It is even used to put data onto the blockchain.  * Platform for ICO's: You cannot just create your own cryptocurrency and expect it to run efficiently. This is especially true if you're looking to do specific with your cryptocurrency than what is already being done. Cryptocurrencies with open source codes can be coped and started by another company but having the ability to have it on a platform that is already one of the best is hard.  * Mining to Staking: Ethereum has said they will be looking to move over from mining to staking as it is much more efficient and secure. Mining is the use of specific hardware that is used to confirm transactions on the blockchain. Staking also confirms transactions however it is done keeping your tokens or coins in your wallet.

It's so convenient to have a camera that fits in a point and shoot bag while delivering image quality on par with full-size DSLRs.  Also on the topic of size, it's much less obtrusive than a large DSLR. Even with a zoom lens people don't think much of it. This is great in settings like small events and museums.  The EOS M3's image quality is great with fast autofocus and a 24.2 MP sensor. While many people compare it to a point-and-shoot, the specs don't agree.  While the M3 doesn't have an optical viewfinder, I managed to get one for $2. On B&H Photo's website there's an option to make a bundle and it takes $200 off the cost. You'll be fine even if you don't get the EVF as the display is amazing.  I don't believe the 700D features WiFi, either. While WiFi on a DSLR is more of an extra feature than a necessity, it is SO helpful to be able to view and save images to your phone via the app. I post almost all of my images to Instagram so this is a must when I'm traveling and away from a computer. Remote shooting is also convenient when I need it but this rarely happens.  Overall, the choice between the two cameras really does come down to what you want. They're both great cameras and each one will serve your basic needs almost equally as well. To come to a strong conclusion I would compare the extra features each camera offers and see which one fits your needs better.  Good luck with your choice!"}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "A Dslr is a Dslr is a Dslr!!! And 700D is one.

But even so, I don't consider myself to be a professional.  To me, the word professional is very ambiguous. The real meaning of the word \\\"professional\\\" is that you are making a living out of your photography, so in this case the camera must be able to produce photos with image quality that surpass the minimum photo-publishing requirements. In this case, a 700D with its 18MP Canon sensor that's also being used in the 7D meets the requirement, as the image quality produced by the 700D will satisfy at the very least the minimum standard requirement of many photographers; so it's safe to say it's good enough to be considered a \\\"professional camera\\\". A lot of low-budget studios where I live, which I consider to be professional photography studio, even still use the good-old 500D for passport headshots and similar stuffs, and they make money from it; that makes the 500D a \\\"professional camera\\\". I'm pretty sure that the photos from the 700D are also good enough to even get pass the very strict requirement of a lot of professional stock photography agencies. So there's that one kind of professional.    On the other hand, the assumed meaning of the word \\\"professional camera\\\" that the camera manufacturers and marketing departments tried to emphasize to us is the camera with the most feature packed with a very high price-level. Well, in this case, the 700D is not a professional camera, and the manufacturer will push you towards a 7D, 5D or 1D, in hope that you'll buy those products with a much higher margin to both cover the operational cost of the manufacturer and make more profit for the company. They don't care if you make a living out of your camera or not, but the 7D, 6D, 5D, and 1D are professional cameras. That's another kind of professional.  Now let's discuss the 700D specifically. I don't personally own the 700D but I used to own a 650D for one year, and it's spec'ed very similar to the 700D. The 650D/700D can shoot 18MP RAW or JPEG with a CMOS sensor that's very similar to the sensor on the high-end Canon 7D. It does shoot at 4 or 5fps burst image, it shoot 30fps video at 1080p, it has a decent viewfinder, and a good all-around control as well as menu.   Upgrading from a 650D/700D to a 7D, a \\\"professional\\\" camera, will give you faster burst image at 8fps, weather-sealing, better view-finder, more extensive manual control, and a heavier body. But it will not give you a better image quality.   Upgrading to a 5D Mark III will give you a somewhat cleaner image quality at high ISO, better control, better viewfinder, weather-sealing, better video output, but you're back with 5fps burst speed, and you'll have to invest to full-frame lenses.   Upgrading to 1D, you'll get 7D fast-performance with an almost-5D-like image quality, but it'll cost you as much as a used decent car.  Now the important question that you'll have to ask for yourself is: will you make more money if you have a 7D, 6D, 5D, or a 1D? Maybe yes, maybe no. But one thing for sure, you'll have to spend more money to buy those cameras than if you buy the 700D. Can you justify that? Do you really need to have those features on those so-called professional cameras, or can you live with just the features on the 700D?  I personally don't give too much thought about using the so-called professional cameras. As long as I can deliver the results needed by the clients or by yourself, I think I'm happy. My 650D could deliver the result that I require back then, and to my book, it's good enough. I don't know about you, nor do I know about your photography requirement, so I can't speak for you.  To conclude, I quoted a small part of David Thorpe's blog post with the title \\\"Is This Camera Professional\\\". David Thorpe is an ex-photojournalist from UK, a true professional photographer in my opinion. Here's that quote:   %3E When John Downing took the classic picture of a stunned Margaret Thatcher leaving the Imperial hotel in Brighton, England, after the IRA had bombed it, he had been having a drink in the bar. The bomb went off and John couldn't get to his room to get his \\u2018proper' cameras. But he he had a Canon Sureshot, the same as my mum used on holiday, in his pocket.  And it was on the Sureshot that the pic was made.  That makes it a professional camera in my book. Cameras are not professional, people are. An Olympus Pen in Sebastaio Delgado's hands is a professional camera. A Nikon D4 in my sister's is not. Here's the link to that blog post \\\"Is this Camera Professional?\\\" [ http://m43blog.dthorpe.net/2014/10/23/is-this-camera-professional/ ]   I hope I helped you with my answer. Good luck!  "}, {"upvote": 78, "content": "I see a lot of answers claiming \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" for photography in general. Do not get this line of thinking stuck in your head because it's not entirely true. In fact, to be honest, this statement is used many times by people who simply can't afford good gear and are jealous at those who can. If you can't afford good gear right now, that's fine; work with what you can afford and save up money to grow into better gear over time. The best camera is always the one you have with you and by this I mean, if you own a $6,500 Canon 1DX and it's sitting at home, your best camera may be the free one that came built into the phone in your pocket!  While it is true, skill is the most important aspect of almost anything, including photography, your gear and even more specifically, your lenses, are just as important. A good lens on an inexpensive camera is always better than a cheap lens on an expensive camera. If you're just starting out and looking for a camera for a beginner, try to think about what sort of photography you'll be doing. General photography such as family photos, photos of your friends, pets, etc.; landscape photography; wildlife photography; street photography, etc. If you don't know yet, that's okay but if you have a goal of developing skills specific to one of these styles, it will help with camera selection.  When getting started, I'd get something inexpensive but not so cheap that your photo quality ends up discouraging you altogether (again, this is where the \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" nonsense kicks in.) I'll cover a couple types and why they're good starter cameras. And with any camera you choose, always try to keep the camera out of \\\"automatic mode\\\" if possible so you begin to master the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  Point-and-Shoot or Camera Phone  These cameras are very inexpensive and with the newer smartphones, the camera is built right in and often takes better photos than the DSLR's from just a few years ago! This is the most inexpensive route to take (and may not cost a penny if you use the camera on your phone) and it helps you learn about composition, lighting, etc. If you're already past this point and want a camera you can grow into, the following are good options:  Traditional SLR's  I know, this is probably not what most people think of when deciding on a beginner's camera but I want to mention it because if you have one of these lying around in your house (parent's or grandparent's old camera, etc.), they're great for learning the basics of a camera with all of the digital stuff removed. SLR (single lens reflex) cameras aren't used much anymore because of the cost of operation, decreased photo quality, and lack of film processing labs, however, I think any aspiring photographer should own or at least use one because they are the \\\"original camera\\\", they are inexpensive, and they help give you a greater appreciation for the luxury of digital photography (not limited to 24-36 photos per roll, immediate results where you can see your photo seconds after taking it, easy and fast multiple frame shooting, and no cost by ruining a roll of film or wasting it on bad photos.) If you buy a traditional SLR 35mm camera, I'd go for something like the Nikon 35mm F2AS with a 50mm \\\"prime lens\\\", or similar. Here's a photo of one of mine:  Digital SLR's  Digital SLR's, or DSLR's, have been the most popular choice for many years now, they're easy to find used, and they're a good starting point in learning photography. These cameras are basically digital versions of the original SLR camera but offer much more flexibility and many more options. Whagt we're seeing right now, however, is a switch from DSLR's to \\\"mirrorless cameras\\\", including the very popular \\\"Micro Four Thirds\\\" cameras which use a smaller sensor, yet often outperform the DSLR's. I'll touch on those, below. Anyway, an inexpensive or used DSLR is a good choice for starting out and I'd recommend an entry level Canon DSLR such as one of the \\\"Rebel\\\" series cameras. I currently use a Canon 1DX which is NOT a beginner's camera, and my old Canon 5D Mark II (this is a great beginner's camera, easy to find, and inexpensive.) Here's a photo of the Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm prime lens attached:  Mirrorless Cameras  These cameras really are \\\"the future of photography\\\" although many professional photographers would scoff at you for even suggesting such a thing because just as it was when SLR's were phasing out, DSLR using pro's often get stuck in their ways and refuse to move with the times. Even today there are professional photographers who refuse to switch from SLR to DSLR! Mirrorless cameras are superior to DSLR's in almost every way: They have higher resolution (megapixels) for a fraction of the cost of DSLR's; there's no mirror flapping around making noise and causing camera vibration; they're smaller and easier to carry, many can shoot 4K and even Cinema 4K video (while Canon and Nikon refuse to adapt and offer this feature for a reasonable price in their DSLR's); and overall, they're less expensive. If you can afford one (they're often cheaper than many new DSLR's), go for it! I currently shoot with a Panasonic Lumix GH4 because I shoot photography AND I need to shoot 4K video and this camera does both. An even less expensive alternative is the Lumix GH3 which sells for around $500, a quarter of the price of the GH4. Here's a photo of the Lumix GH4, a \\\"mirrorless camera\\\":  Regardless of what you choose, unless it's a cheap $30 point-and-shoot or your phone's camera, try to make a decision on which camera format you want to grow into, otherwise you'll be wasting money on a camera and the expensive lenses that you'll end up not using when you switch to a different format.  Taking an introductory photography class or workshop is also a good idea when getting started as you'll more quickly learn the basics including aperture, exposure, shutter speed, composition, and editing. Good luck with your search and your journey into photography!"}, {"upvote": 2, "content": "I have a 760D, which is the immediate predecessor of the 77D, and almost identical. It is a great picture taker. The relatively inexpensive EF-S lenses are also excellent. I would definitely give it my recommendation.  However, also consider the 80D. It costs a bit more. But it is a pro camera while the 77D is an \\u2018enthusiast' camera. It has a bigger and brighter viewfinder, a stronger build, a few more controls. And it accommodates C (custom) settings, a great feature, IMO.  The results from either camera will be the same though. They have the same sensor and focusing system. The 77D is a little smaller and lighter. Both take great pictures."}, {"upvote": 21, "content": "The EOS 1D X is pretty much overkill\\u2026 this is kind of an odd list, with over a 12:1 price range. Not only is the 1D X around $6,000 (body-only), but you're going to need expensive CFast cards for 4K video, and the 4K video on the thing is in gigantic Motion JPEG files, and not all that amazing anyway. If I wanted a 4K camera for video, I'd recommend either get a Panasonic GH4 or perhaps a Sony A7s mark II.  The Nikon D80 (2006) and the D3 (2007) are ancient models and don't shoot video. The D3s does shoot video, but only 720p, not full HD.  The EOS 7D (2009) is also fairly old. It can shoot 720p or 1080p video, but only 12 minutes at a time. The others here can shoot 29\\u203259\\u2033 without stopping \\u2014 that's a limit set to avoid paying a European camcorder tax. While it doesn't apply at all in the USA, most camera manufacturers (other than Panasonic, far as I know) impose this limit even on North American and Japanese models.  The Nikon D5300 isn't a bad choice for video. It's a few models old, it came out in 2003, the current model is the D5600, so it's may be available for a value price. But this line is a consumer line, APS-C sensor, and not terribly expensive. It can shoot video at 1080p up to 60fps\\u2026 not something you'd need for vlogging, but you want 60p for sports or other action video. Another advantage for vlogging, the D5300 has built-in WiFi, so it can be controlled wirelessly via an app. Most Canon and Nikon can be tethered via USB for remote control, and some have add-on controls, but it's handy to have it built-in.  I have the EOS 6D, and it produces amazing video, particularly in low light, where it blows away my far more expensive dedicated camcorders. The 6D right now is a good bargain, but mostly because everyone expects Canon to announce the 6D mark II Real Soon Now. The 6D also has built-in WiFi.  The EOS 5D mark III is the upgrade of Canon's breakthrough EOS 5D mark II. It's a great camera, one of the go-to standards for video-on-stills camera shooting. But while it's a solid choice if you can afford it, it's not the best choice. For one, it's been superceeded by the EOS 5D mark IV, if you're looking for a higher end model that shoots great video.  Of those on your list, the Canon EOS 80D would be my choice for anyone wanting a strong video option. Like the Nikon, it can shoot a variety of modes up to 1080p60. But the real advantage is in the sensor. This is Canon's second-generation mid-range DSLR with what they call a Dual Pixel sensor. This sensor splits each pixel into two separate photodiodes. Based on the way they're masked, each sensor pair works like a phase-detect autofocus sensor. So unlike every other DSLR on your list, the 80D can give you full performance autofocus in video, and things you usually just find on camcorders and mirrorless cameras, like follow-focus in video, etc. Dual Pixel is also used on Canon's 5D mark IV and all the new Cinema EOS video cameras. And the 80D also has built-in WiFi.  Far as the larger idea of a full camera system goes, you can't really go wrong with either Canon or Nikon. They have the two most complete lines of cameras and two most complete collection of lenses. However, neither offers a mirrorless option. So that means you're only shooting video from the back screen, not the viewfinder. And that only the 80D on your list has fully function video autofocus\\u2026 the others will AF in video, but it's on demand, not continuous, and it's often not very good. The phase detect sensors that DSLRs use are not available with the mirror up, which is what you have in video mode.  For one-person vlogging, keep in mind you are going to want to see yourself, which means either an add-on monitor while shooting or an articulated screen. The 80D and the D5300 both have fully articulated screens which let you see what you're recording from the front of the camera. The others do not, and will absolutely require an external monitor for vlogging."}, {"upvote": 12, "content": "This depends on what existing camera you have, or if you are a first time buyer, and what you intend to use the camera for. You cannot get a specific answer with a generic question. I have just bought a 6D Mark II. I have had the original 6D for nearly three years. I shoot live music in mostly small, badly lit venues. When I bought the 6D it was Canon's best low-light camera (even better than the 5D MkII and 1DX). It was also very affordable for someone who makes very little money working in a sector with very little money. It was an upgrade from a 550D (APS-C). I had one EF-S lens for that camera \\u2013 a Tamron 17\\u201350 f/2.8 that was my go to lens. My 70\\u2013200 f/2.8 was an EF. When I upgraded, I bought a used Canon 24\\u201370 f/2.8, and a friend sold me his 16\\u201335mm f/2.8 at a bargain price. I now had a full range of full-frame lenses that I needed for the 6D. That camera has now taken close 30k photos, but no video, so I was feeling the need to get a new body (as in camera, although the physical one could do with an upgrade too) when the EOS-R was announced. Personally, I'm not overly convinced about the hype over mirrorless cameras (I do have an EOS M2 as a pocket camera), probably because I have been using an SLR since the 1970s and they have never failed, and I mostly see mirrorless as a marketing ploy to sell more gear.  I looked at the same options you have asked about and asked myself if I wanted to use a body almost identical to the one I was currently familiar with, but upgraded, or go for a new technology with a new lens mount. I then looked at my bank account and prices of the two options. I found a new 6D MkII and battery grip for under \\u00a31100. It was not a difficult decision at that point. A new camera body that would use all my existing lenses without needing an adaptor, and without the need to familiarise myself with a new body and way of working, as well as using a new system in its first iteration that would need regular firmware updates. During my next upgrade cycle I may opt for the EOS-R as all the bugs will have been sorted, and my lenses will probably need upgrading as well by then.  So, as you can see, there is no definitive answer. My advice is to never buy a camera purely from the spec sheets, or people's reviews either. You need to actually hold them in your hands and use them in the situation you intend to use them most. Don't buy a camera that is over-specced for what you are shooting. For example, do you really need a full-frame camera? If you mostly want to shoot video, would an actual video camera serve you better? And always look at your budget, and don't spend more than you need to, especially if it's a hobby.  Hope all this helps."}, {"upvote": 16, "content": "It's a decent start, but it also tells you a few things about Canon's thinking right now. And I think they made some good decisions, and a few bad ones that may have not been choices as much as technical limitations.  Neither Canon nor Nikon were actually new to mirrorless with last August's introductions. But the R and the Z are professional formats, even if the first models are not a match for the top-of-the-line DSLRs yet. Both Canon and Nikon took on the idea that mirrorless was something less than DSLR, a step between DSLR and compact digital cameras (aka point and shoot). Nikon's 1 system used the same 1\\u2033 sensor size found in high-end P&S cameras like the Sony RX10 and RX100. But Canon put out a very compact APS-C system with their EOS M. And a funny thing happened: while Nikon's 1 system is now defunct, the EOS M is very popular, albeit not necessarily in the USA. Canon's been the #2 mirrorless brand in Japan in 2016 and 2017 (BCN rankings, second to Olympus) and looks to be taking the #1 spot for the 2018 year\\u2026 without even counting the EOS R. Canon seems to have nailed the consumer mirrorless ILC with the EOS M.  So it should be no surprise that Canon got into mirrorless on a higher level with the EOS R, but then again, it should be. Canon is slower to react to competition than just about anyone. Why this, why now? Canon feels the competition.  For most of history since maybe the 1940s or 1950s, Canon and Nikon had much of the professional market for cameras. In the 1960s, led by Nikon, they won an 80% share, and it's been pretty much 80\\u201390% ever since. Canon managed to flip the market share on Nikon by being the first to court consumers, and then by delivering the fastest speeds for pro sports shooters. But for a long time, the only 35mm, then full-frame choice for most pros was Nikon or Canon.  This last year, the whole industry sold only 11.6 million ILCs, less than half of those sold in 2013. And 2017 was actually an 8% increase from 2016. But more the point, DSLRs sold only accounted for 65% of the ILC market\\u2026 clearly, Nikon and Canon were no longer winning an 80\\u201390% share. And while Canon's mirrorless sales were up 70% in 2017, Nikon wasn't even part of that. And of course, neither was competitive with Sony, Olympus, Panasonic, or Fujifilm in higher-end mirrorless. No one knows just where the DSLR vs. mirrorless ratio settles out in the long term, but it's not going to be terribly favorable to any company only making DSLRs.  What's It For?  If you look carefully at the EOS R, like the Nikon Z's, you'll know just what it's for: the EOS R is a mirrorless body for Canon users to buy, so that they don't buy Sonys. This is the big factor. Canon users have been trying Sony A7s with adapters, and liking them. Some keep it as an accessory, but some sell their Canon gear and move to Sony. Canon needs that to stop, and their first reaction to this situation is the EOS R.  Canon's introducing one body and four lenses, two of them quite expensive, but still, that's not a full system for nearly anyone who needs a system camera. It's a start. But if you're already a Canon shooter, the R is with an adapter is going to let you try out mirrorless with all of your glass \\u2014 even EF-S lenses, but EF-M lenses are impossible \\u2014 your existing batteries and flash units, etc. It's a much simpler way to experiment with mirrorless for today's Canon shooter. If you're new to ILCs and want full-frame mirrorless, EOS R won't be a great option for at least 3\\u20135 years, depending on how quickly Canon rolls out new glass.  So you're supposed to compare the EOS R to a Sony A7 Mark III, but the closest match is actually the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV. So you're getting more or less a mirrorless 5D Mark IV with some improvements/extra features for $900 less. That's a pretty fine deal, speaking from the Canon universe. It's a bit more expensive than the A7 Mark III, but no one's more aggressive on body pricing than Sony.  I think it succeeds in its mission. If I still had my Canon system and was ready for full frame mirrorless, the EOS R is a no-brainer versus the Sony. It's not even the cost of the bodies or the minute details of the features, but the fact it's already part of my system. The cheap lens adapter is only $100, and it works perfectly. For a bit more, I could get the adapter with filter holder, simply brilliant for video work.  Video Issues  Alas, on that latter one, Canon's still being Canon, and not in a good way. They're still crippling 4K video on the EOS R, delivering the same 1.7x crop you have on the EOS 5D mark IV. If you're buying a full-frame DSLR for video, the point is to have full frame video. With that crop, you're better off going to a Panasonic GH5 or a Blackmagic Design Pocket Cinema Camera 4K, depending on your needs.  I expect for most stills work, you have a 5D Mark IV as far as the quality goes. You won't quite match Sony in very low light, but you'll have a bit more resolution in bright light, so it's probably not a big deal for most photographers. You'll have the Canon color, which Sony has yet to match, and the Canon menus you're used to\\u2026 well, maybe. They have a few new controls on the camera, which changes around the way its used. There's a programmable ring control on lenses, but you won't run into that with adapted EF lenses unless you get the third adapter, the one with the ring control. There's also a touch strip on the back, which most reviewers aren't yet crazy about.  Neither Sony nor Canon has 10-bit in-camera video, which is what you need for serious Log shooting. But the EOS R does have that as an external option, at least. I'd bet on Sony's A7S Mark III offering 10-bit in some fashion, but like Canon, Sony's got their own cinema camera business they feel compelled to protect by crippling the mirrorless models. Oddly, though, Nikon opted for the same thing, in-camera 8-bit, external 10-bit, even without a video market to protect. I guess that leaves them both with a feature to add to a higher end model, next year. Or save money and buy the GH5 right now.  Conclusions  So basically, I think the EOS R is attractive to anyone with a full Canon system thinking about mirrorless. If Canon's annoying behaviors haven't driven you away yet, this may well be your mirrorless. I don't really find any huge problems with it. Knowing that Sony was the initial target, nothing about the EOS R or the Nikon Zs were particularly unexpected. Both aim for the Sony's, Nikon at both the A7III and the A7RIII, Canon's basically doing the A7III competitor now. I would hope they're holding off an A7RIII competitor until they have some improved sensor tech, probably also going into the EOS 5DS Mark II."}, {"upvote": 15, "content": "Is Canon EOS RP Worth buying?

Now the question is why do people say that this camera has poor specs? Because people only focus on specs and not on what they can do with the camera. I have seen about 99% of the time camera is better than the photographer who uses it. Several decades ago when I was starting out with manual focus SLRs, I was hoping that a better camera will help me overcome my deficiencies. Alas, that's what all photographers think ie. they need a camera which can magically make them better without they learning to become great.  People may say this camera has got still photo shooting burst rate of 5 frames per second. I use a Canon EOS 1DXII which is canon's top of the line still photography camera. However, I rarely use 12fps burst. I shoot a max of 2\\u20133 frames at a time. If you know what you are doing, then you don't need to adopt the spray and pray mode ie keep on pushing the shutter button and hoping that one shot will be great.

Here my personal advice is to buy the Same brand you started with as you are familiar with that brand."}, {"upvote": 78, "content": "I see a lot of answers claiming \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" for photography in general. Do not get this line of thinking stuck in your head because it's not entirely true. In fact, to be honest, this statement is used many times by people who simply can't afford good gear and are jealous at those who can. If you can't afford good gear right now, that's fine; work with what you can afford and save up money to grow into better gear over time. The best camera is always the one you have with you and by this I mean, if you own a $6,500 Canon 1DX and it's sitting at home, your best camera may be the free one that came built into the phone in your pocket!  While it is true, skill is the most important aspect of almost anything, including photography, your gear and even more specifically, your lenses, are just as important. A good lens on an inexpensive camera is always better than a cheap lens on an expensive camera. If you're just starting out and looking for a camera for a beginner, try to think about what sort of photography you'll be doing. General photography such as family photos, photos of your friends, pets, etc.; landscape photography; wildlife photography; street photography, etc. If you don't know yet, that's okay but if you have a goal of developing skills specific to one of these styles, it will help with camera selection.  When getting started, I'd get something inexpensive but not so cheap that your photo quality ends up discouraging you altogether (again, this is where the \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" nonsense kicks in.) I'll cover a couple types and why they're good starter cameras. And with any camera you choose, always try to keep the camera out of \\\"automatic mode\\\" if possible so you begin to master the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  Point-and-Shoot or Camera Phone  These cameras are very inexpensive and with the newer smartphones, the camera is built right in and often takes better photos than the DSLR's from just a few years ago! This is the most inexpensive route to take (and may not cost a penny if you use the camera on your phone) and it helps you learn about composition, lighting, etc. If you're already past this point and want a camera you can grow into, the following are good options:  Traditional SLR's  I know, this is probably not what most people think of when deciding on a beginner's camera but I want to mention it because if you have one of these lying around in your house (parent's or grandparent's old camera, etc.), they're great for learning the basics of a camera with all of the digital stuff removed. SLR (single lens reflex) cameras aren't used much anymore because of the cost of operation, decreased photo quality, and lack of film processing labs, however, I think any aspiring photographer should own or at least use one because they are the \\\"original camera\\\", they are inexpensive, and they help give you a greater appreciation for the luxury of digital photography (not limited to 24-36 photos per roll, immediate results where you can see your photo seconds after taking it, easy and fast multiple frame shooting, and no cost by ruining a roll of film or wasting it on bad photos.) If you buy a traditional SLR 35mm camera, I'd go for something like the Nikon 35mm F2AS with a 50mm \\\"prime lens\\\", or similar. Here's a photo of one of mine:  Digital SLR's  Digital SLR's, or DSLR's, have been the most popular choice for many years now, they're easy to find used, and they're a good starting point in learning photography. These cameras are basically digital versions of the original SLR camera but offer much more flexibility and many more options. Whagt we're seeing right now, however, is a switch from DSLR's to \\\"mirrorless cameras\\\", including the very popular \\\"Micro Four Thirds\\\" cameras which use a smaller sensor, yet often outperform the DSLR's. I'll touch on those, below. Anyway, an inexpensive or used DSLR is a good choice for starting out and I'd recommend an entry level Canon DSLR such as one of the \\\"Rebel\\\" series cameras. I currently use a Canon 1DX which is NOT a beginner's camera, and my old Canon 5D Mark II (this is a great beginner's camera, easy to find, and inexpensive.) Here's a photo of the Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm prime lens attached:  Mirrorless Cameras  These cameras really are \\\"the future of photography\\\" although many professional photographers would scoff at you for even suggesting such a thing because just as it was when SLR's were phasing out, DSLR using pro's often get stuck in their ways and refuse to move with the times. Even today there are professional photographers who refuse to switch from SLR to DSLR! Mirrorless cameras are superior to DSLR's in almost every way: They have higher resolution (megapixels) for a fraction of the cost of DSLR's; there's no mirror flapping around making noise and causing camera vibration; they're smaller and easier to carry, many can shoot 4K and even Cinema 4K video (while Canon and Nikon refuse to adapt and offer this feature for a reasonable price in their DSLR's); and overall, they're less expensive. If you can afford one (they're often cheaper than many new DSLR's), go for it! I currently shoot with a Panasonic Lumix GH4 because I shoot photography AND I need to shoot 4K video and this camera does both. An even less expensive alternative is the Lumix GH3 which sells for around $500, a quarter of the price of the GH4. Here's a photo of the Lumix GH4, a \\\"mirrorless camera\\\":  Regardless of what you choose, unless it's a cheap $30 point-and-shoot or your phone's camera, try to make a decision on which camera format you want to grow into, otherwise you'll be wasting money on a camera and the expensive lenses that you'll end up not using when you switch to a different format.  Taking an introductory photography class or workshop is also a good idea when getting started as you'll more quickly learn the basics including aperture, exposure, shutter speed, composition, and editing.

I will assume that with versatility, you mean better focal length range.

Conversely, prime (fixed focal length) lenses will tipically have a wide aperture and help you in dark conditions, but they aren't as versatile as a zoom lens. For an APS-sized sensor camera like yours, useful and inexpensive primes are: Canon EF-S 24mm f/2.8 STM, Canon EF 28mm f/1.8 USM, Canon EF 35mm f/2 IS USM and the Canon EF 40mm f/2.8 STM. While the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM is very inexpensive and has very good optical quality, its focal range may be cumbersome to take pictures of groups in a small room.   Canon has a general purpose zoom for crop sensor cameras, that has an adequate focal length and wide aperture, which may be what you're looking for: Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM. This lens has very good optical quality but it's somewhat expensive. Canon has other wide aperture zooms, like the EF 24-70mm f/2.8L II USM, but since they're intended to be used in 35mm/full frame cameras, they start their range at 24mm, lacking range at the wide end.  There are also third party alternatives to the  Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM, like the Tamron 17-50mm f/2.8 XR Di II or the Sigma 17-50mm f/2.8 EX DC OS HSM FLD, which also have a wide F/2.8 aperture and good optical performance.

I was supposed to reply within 6 days of reciept of email. Post came 6 days late. As I din't have the habit of checking my emails all this last minute tension started. I sent the confirmation forms and other requested documentary proofs by courier.  This is the month when I realised that I was in reserve list and my name was the first one on list.

While in desk profile, work is normal such as noting, drafting, files, administration work etc.  Coming on to Salary,  Basic salary is 47600 per month  Dearness Allowance is 17% of basic pay but when you join it will be more than 30%  HRA = 24% of basic pay  Travelling allowance is 3600, then there is DA on TA (17% of 3600)  So, In-Hand salary for a newly-joined Enforcement Officer is more than 60,000 per month.  Also , NPS : Government contribute 14% of (basic pay+DA) which is a part of gross salary. So, monthly gross salary is around 76000\\u201377000.

CAPF AC is a Gazzeted Post whereas Even APFC in EPFO is not a gazetted Officer. 2.

It features an APS-C sized sensor (1.6x magnification factor versus full frame DSLRs), it shoots 18Mpixel still images, shoots burst shots at 3.0 fps, up to approximately 69 JPEGs or approximately 6 raw file before slowing down to write to the SD/SDHC/SDXC/EyeFi card. It handles video at 1920x1080-24/25/30p or 1200x720-50/60p, encoded in IP long-GOP AVC at 44Mb/s. It's got 9-point autofocus with one cross-type sensor in the center, sensitivity to 0EV in the center and 1EV on the other points. And a 63 point auto exposure system with metering to 1EV.  Shutter speeds to 1/4000th second, down to 30seconds. Back panel display is 460K dot resolution. You get about 500 shots through the viewfinder, no flash. Shoots raw or JPEG or both, offers the usual P/A/S/M pro modes as well as a bunch of consumer oriented shooting modes I never use so won't really compare here.   So it's got all the check-marks for a regular DSLR. So what's missing or limited? Here's some:    * Pentamirror. Cheaper DSLRs have a pentamirror rather than a pentaprism in the viewfinder -- that's the bit of optics that inverts the lens image to deliver a right-side-up view for your eye. A pentamirror is a bit dimmer.   * No microphone input. If you're really interested in video, you're not using your on-camera audio for anything but synchronization. But some people get better-than-nothing results using an external mic. When I shoot video with my EOS 6D, I feed the audio output from my Tascam DR-60D recorder into the 6D to ensure a better sync track. But I would still get a good sync with the camera's internal mono audio in most case.   * Some cameras have faster shutter speeds and other operations. My 6D is also limited to 1/4000th, but it shoots 4.5fps. My Olympus OM-D mirrorless shoots up to 10fps, 1/8000th shutter speed with mechanical shutter, 1/16000th electronics. Those are occasionally useful things, but back in the film days, I had 3fps and 1/4000th second, max.   * Both of my cameras shoot better video, offering AVC-Intra modes that shoot with less compression at higher bitrates. Some cameras these days also offer 1920x1080/60p video. Most of these are issues for fast motion, so if you're planning to shoot nothing but sports, maybe this is not your camera.   * My 6D also has 9 AF sensors and a cross in the center... not a problem for me. It's sensitive down to -3EV, though, which means better performance when it's very dark. But it's a much more expensive camera. Some other Canons have way more AF points and more cross type sensors, which lets you get into focus tracking and other things that are also well suited to sports, maybe nature, but aren't deal breakers.   * My OM-D has IBIS (In Body Image Stabilization), which lets is stabilize the shot for any lens. It's pretty amazing. On the 6D, like the 1200D, image stabilization is a function of the lens.   * Wifi. Both of my cameras have built-in Wifi, the 1200D does not. Is that useful? For me, pretty rarely. I do have remote trigger apps which let me fire the cameras from my smartphone, that's pretty much the main point of it. I can also transfer images, subject to limitations, but I don't really use that feature. If that's important to you, you can use an EyeFi card or look at a different model.   * Articulated screen. The 1200D screen is fixed. So is the 6D screen... Canon's pretty much only put articulated screens on mid-range cameras. My OM-D has an articulated screen, which is handy for overhead shots, selfies if you must, but most of the time it's main value is that it lets me fold the screen around against the camera body, to save power and avoid scratches. I like viewfinders.   * Battery life. The 1200D uses Canon's consumer model battery, so your 500 shot life is about half of what I get with the 6D. But better than most mirrorless. The OM-D gets about 310 shots based on the CIPA rating unless I tweak the settings to aggressive switch things off. Naturally, as a DSLR, you're draining the battery just to look through the viewfinder.   * No touchscreen... not really much of an issue. Consumer P&S cameras do have touchscreens because they lack controls. The 1200D has a pretty regular Canon button layout -- if you know one Canon, you can pretty much figure out any other.  Even more recent DSLRs and mirrorless with touchscreens don't often do much with them.

You must have a class 6 card in the device to be able to write video."}, {"upvote": 21, "content": "The EOS 1D X is pretty much overkill\\u2026 this is kind of an odd list, with over a 12:1 price range. Not only is the 1D X around $6,000 (body-only), but you're going to need expensive CFast cards for 4K video, and the 4K video on the thing is in gigantic Motion JPEG files, and not all that amazing anyway. If I wanted a 4K camera for video, I'd recommend either get a Panasonic GH4 or perhaps a Sony A7s mark II.  The Nikon D80 (2006) and the D3 (2007) are ancient models and don't shoot video. The D3s does shoot video, but only 720p, not full HD.  The EOS 7D (2009) is also fairly old. It can shoot 720p or 1080p video, but only 12 minutes at a time. The others here can shoot 29\\u203259\\u2033 without stopping \\u2014 that's a limit set to avoid paying a European camcorder tax. While it doesn't apply at all in the USA, most camera manufacturers (other than Panasonic, far as I know) impose this limit even on North American and Japanese models.  The Nikon D5300 isn't a bad choice for video. It's a few models old, it came out in 2003, the current model is the D5600, so it's may be available for a value price. But this line is a consumer line, APS-C sensor, and not terribly expensive. It can shoot video at 1080p up to 60fps\\u2026 not something you'd need for vlogging, but you want 60p for sports or other action video. Another advantage for vlogging, the D5300 has built-in WiFi, so it can be controlled wirelessly via an app. Most Canon and Nikon can be tethered via USB for remote control, and some have add-on controls, but it's handy to have it built-in.  I have the EOS 6D, and it produces amazing video, particularly in low light, where it blows away my far more expensive dedicated camcorders. The 6D right now is a good bargain, but mostly because everyone expects Canon to announce the 6D mark II Real Soon Now. The 6D also has built-in WiFi.  The EOS 5D mark III is the upgrade of Canon's breakthrough EOS 5D mark II. It's a great camera, one of the go-to standards for video-on-stills camera shooting. But while it's a solid choice if you can afford it, it's not the best choice. For one, it's been superceeded by the EOS 5D mark IV, if you're looking for a higher end model that shoots great video.  Of those on your list, the Canon EOS 80D would be my choice for anyone wanting a strong video option. Like the Nikon, it can shoot a variety of modes up to 1080p60. But the real advantage is in the sensor. This is Canon's second-generation mid-range DSLR with what they call a Dual Pixel sensor. This sensor splits each pixel into two separate photodiodes. Based on the way they're masked, each sensor pair works like a phase-detect autofocus sensor. So unlike every other DSLR on your list, the 80D can give you full performance autofocus in video, and things you usually just find on camcorders and mirrorless cameras, like follow-focus in video, etc. Dual Pixel is also used on Canon's 5D mark IV and all the new Cinema EOS video cameras. And the 80D also has built-in WiFi.  Far as the larger idea of a full camera system goes, you can't really go wrong with either Canon or Nikon. They have the two most complete lines of cameras and two most complete collection of lenses. However, neither offers a mirrorless option. So that means you're only shooting video from the back screen, not the viewfinder. And that only the 80D on your list has fully function video autofocus\\u2026 the others will AF in video, but it's on demand, not continuous, and it's often not very good. The phase detect sensors that DSLRs use are not available with the mirror up, which is what you have in video mode.  For one-person vlogging, keep in mind you are going to want to see yourself, which means either an add-on monitor while shooting or an articulated screen.

And they give good advice. Mainly they say hold on to your 1300D and spend money on lenses. But I'm not going to give you advice. Instead, I'll answer your question.  Now it's good to know whether you want to continue with an APS-C camera, or move up to full frame. If you want to stay with cropped, I like the 80D. You may not see much difference in your pictures, but there are several features that facilitate shooting, like brighter finder, articulated touch screen, and custom settings. My experience with the EF-S lenses is that they are optically fine but a little short in build. On the plus side you can build an arsenal of superb lenses that will have most ranges covered, for a modest investment. The 80D is due for an update soon. Keep your eye out for bargains.  If you want to go full frame, I like the 6Dii, though I still use a 6D, myself. (But I'm retired.) Bargains on 6Ds are also around. If you go to full frame, the lenses get orders of magnitude more expensive in most cases. The pictures are better.

Choose a camera with a manual setting and experiment with the relationship between lens aperture (f-stop), shutter speed (time) and sensor sensitivity (ISO). Learn the difference between center spot metering and scene metering. Similarly understand the differences between spot focusing and scene focusing. Get a camera with a zoom lens and take photos of faces which fill the entire image both by zooming in on the face and by zooming out then walking forward until the face fills the image. Do you see the difference? Do you understand why there is a difference?  Next, learn the rules of good composition. Understand the rule of thirds, the importance of leading lines, the impact of light and shadow. Be critical of your images. Always ask yourself what would have made this photograph better and try out that idea. Watch photo movies on youtube and read as much as you can about photography.  Every camera has some limitations. Learn to work within those limitations. Start developing a photographic style. Work on seeing possibly great photographs when you walk around or drive anywhere. What do you find yourself photographing most - landscapes? people? buildings? flowers? insects? sports? sunsets? birds? wildlife?  You can do all the above with a relatively inexpensive small-sensor mirrorless camera with a zoom lens. It will be a fairly small camera which is not too much of a problem to carry with you. Take as many images as you can and then study each one. Rinse and repeat until you instinctively know what the image will look like before you even take the shot. Before you even lift the camera you just know that you have to move about twenty feet to your left and to kneel to get the right shot. You just know that the shadow across the front of the church will disappear in half and hour and give you a magnificent image. You just know that the contrast is too high and highlights in the scene will be blown out as white blobs, so you need to under-expose the image a bit. This may take a long time, but remember no pain - no gain.  When you reach this stage in your personal development you will know where you want to concentrate your photography. You will understand what features you need in a camera and where your current camera is limiting you. You will also understand the principles of different focal lengths for different images and how crop factor influences the focal length of a lens.  This is the time to make a list of all the things you MUST HAVE in a camera as well as those items which would be NICE TO HAVE if available. For instance lets assume you become most interested in sports photography. Your list of MUST HAVE items in a camera may include   * Fast shutter speed - 1/8000th.  * Fast continuous shutter - 10 or more frames per second.  * Fast accurate focusing and focus tracking  * 100mm to 500mm zoom lens  * In camera 5-axis sensor anti-shake system Now look at camera specs which meet this list and choose the ones that meet all the requirements. Then, from that shortlist choose which you like best because of its price, design, battery life, LED screen or whatever. You will then end up with the camera that suits your needs and makes you happy - and don't limit yourself to a Canon 1300D or a Nikon D3300 because your friend has one or the guy in the photo store recommends it for beginners.

It's just a bit bulkier and has a louder click sound which are both downsides.  Canon EOS M50 is a nice camera but I think FujiFilm has a better user interface which is important for beginners. So the final shootout would be between the two FujiFilm cameras. They have similar specs, just the design is different. If you are a female you will prefer the A7 since it comes in fashionable body colours. T200 comes in black, gold and silver variants only and is the more masculine looking. A7 has a touchscreen, however, it misses the electronic viewfinder (EVF) which the T200 has.  It may seem that the omission of the EVF is not a big deal, since the A7 has an fully articulated screen. But even the best screen can be hard to read in bright sunlight. T200 is the clear winner with it's classic appearance and both EVF plus the articulated screen.

Do not get this line of thinking stuck in your head because it's not entirely true. In fact, to be honest, this statement is used many times by people who simply can't afford good gear and are jealous at those who can. If you can't afford good gear right now, that's fine; work with what you can afford and save up money to grow into better gear over time. The best camera is always the one you have with you and by this I mean, if you own a $6,500 Canon 1DX and it's sitting at home, your best camera may be the free one that came built into the phone in your pocket!  While it is true, skill is the most important aspect of almost anything, including photography, your gear and even more specifically, your lenses, are just as important. A good lens on an inexpensive camera is always better than a cheap lens on an expensive camera. If you're just starting out and looking for a camera for a beginner, try to think about what sort of photography you'll be doing. General photography such as family photos, photos of your friends, pets, etc.; landscape photography; wildlife photography; street photography, etc. If you don't know yet, that's okay but if you have a goal of developing skills specific to one of these styles, it will help with camera selection.  When getting started, I'd get something inexpensive but not so cheap that your photo quality ends up discouraging you altogether (again, this is where the \\\"skill is better than your gear\\\" nonsense kicks in.) I'll cover a couple types and why they're good starter cameras. And with any camera you choose, always try to keep the camera out of \\\"automatic mode\\\" if possible so you begin to master the basics of aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  Point-and-Shoot or Camera Phone  These cameras are very inexpensive and with the newer smartphones, the camera is built right in and often takes better photos than the DSLR's from just a few years ago! This is the most inexpensive route to take (and may not cost a penny if you use the camera on your phone) and it helps you learn about composition, lighting, etc. If you're already past this point and want a camera you can grow into, the following are good options:  Traditional SLR's  I know, this is probably not what most people think of when deciding on a beginner's camera but I want to mention it because if you have one of these lying around in your house (parent's or grandparent's old camera, etc.), they're great for learning the basics of a camera with all of the digital stuff removed. SLR (single lens reflex) cameras aren't used much anymore because of the cost of operation, decreased photo quality, and lack of film processing labs, however, I think any aspiring photographer should own or at least use one because they are the \\\"original camera\\\", they are inexpensive, and they help give you a greater appreciation for the luxury of digital photography (not limited to 24-36 photos per roll, immediate results where you can see your photo seconds after taking it, easy and fast multiple frame shooting, and no cost by ruining a roll of film or wasting it on bad photos.) If you buy a traditional SLR 35mm camera, I'd go for something like the Nikon 35mm F2AS with a 50mm \\\"prime lens\\\", or similar. Here's a photo of one of mine:  Digital SLR's  Digital SLR's, or DSLR's, have been the most popular choice for many years now, they're easy to find used, and they're a good starting point in learning photography. These cameras are basically digital versions of the original SLR camera but offer much more flexibility and many more options. Whagt we're seeing right now, however, is a switch from DSLR's to \\\"mirrorless cameras\\\", including the very popular \\\"Micro Four Thirds\\\" cameras which use a smaller sensor, yet often outperform the DSLR's. I'll touch on those, below. Anyway, an inexpensive or used DSLR is a good choice for starting out and I'd recommend an entry level Canon DSLR such as one of the \\\"Rebel\\\" series cameras. I currently use a Canon 1DX which is NOT a beginner's camera, and my old Canon 5D Mark II (this is a great beginner's camera, easy to find, and inexpensive.) Here's a photo of the Canon 5D Mark II with a 50mm prime lens attached:  Mirrorless Cameras  These cameras really are \\\"the future of photography\\\" although many professional photographers would scoff at you for even suggesting such a thing because just as it was when SLR's were phasing out, DSLR using pro's often get stuck in their ways and refuse to move with the times. Even today there are professional photographers who refuse to switch from SLR to DSLR! Mirrorless cameras are superior to DSLR's in almost every way: They have higher resolution (megapixels) for a fraction of the cost of DSLR's; there's no mirror flapping around making noise and causing camera vibration; they're smaller and easier to carry, many can shoot 4K and even Cinema 4K video (while Canon and Nikon refuse to adapt and offer this feature for a reasonable price in their DSLR's); and overall, they're less expensive. If you can afford one (they're often cheaper than many new DSLR's), go for it! I currently shoot with a Panasonic Lumix GH4 because I shoot photography AND I need to shoot 4K video and this camera does both. An even less expensive alternative is the Lumix GH3 which sells for around $500, a quarter of the price of the GH4. Here's a photo of the Lumix GH4, a \\\"mirrorless camera\\\":  Regardless of what you choose, unless it's a cheap $30 point-and-shoot or your phone's camera, try to make a decision on which camera format you want to grow into, otherwise you'll be wasting money on a camera and the expensive lenses that you'll end up not using when you switch to a different format.  Taking an introductory photography class or workshop is also a good idea when getting started as you'll more quickly learn the basics including aperture, exposure, shutter speed, composition, and editing.

For a little bit more you can get a used 5D mark III, which is a hell of a camera, especially for portrait work.  I shot this with a Canon 40D. You can pick one up for under $100.

And some are more rugged (designed for journalists, sports photographers and others that can't always protect their gear as carefully as they should).  But the most important tool of all is the skills of the photographer. A good photographer with an old camera will almost always get a better picture than a new photographer with the newest and best camera.  So, what to do? Try all three cameras and choose the one that fits your hands and mind the best. Then spend time and money improving your skills in taking and post-processing your pictures.

It all comes down to being permissioned and non-trustless. That leads to the following, insurmountable problems.  1. 1 person is in charge and can change the constitution at will. This wouldn't be so bad in a trustless and permissionless platform, but wreaks havoc in a non trustless and permissioned platform. Also if it were several people in charge that have to write a constitution, it's even worse, because writing a constitution with many people is always victim of special interests, lobbying and the like. 2. A design that doesn't prevent cartel formation. Cartels always happen if it is possible. 3. If the security of a network relies on 1 person, it can't get mass adoption, because that person has to be perfect. Unfortunately, he isn't perfect, because he has made a very bad constitution.

Investing in Ethereum is a bet that it'll be the most used platform to build decentralized applications on.

If cryptocurrency (or blockchain technology in general) is ever going to become a mainstream piece of the future, it relies on being able to connect to real-world data (i.e. data outside of the blockchain). Chainlink is the best option for this, and by a long shot.  Personally, if I had to choose between the two, I'd pick chainlink as the better investment because ethereum is mostly winning the race of protocols due to it's big headstart.

Ethereum 2.0 (which is still a couple years away from fully launching) has to work or else it'll get passed up. Chainlink provides accurate, reliable data, and for blockchains data is the new oil."}, {"upvote": 3, "content": "It's kind of difficult to answer without actually getting into what you want really. Will try to give a generalised answer.  General Acceptance: Ethereum better known for its market capitalisation. Means they have more money in circulation. The only coin that beats Ethereum is Bitcoin in this regard. ETH also more well known than EOS. i.e., more places you can trade especially decentralized exchanges. Ethereum also has better wallet support.  Developer Support: Ethereum's developer community is larger than EOS's. There's a vast array of developers available if one wants to develop a dApp. However, the EOS block producers and block producer candidates are (indirectly) incentivized to help the dev community by providing support, tools and sometimes funding. The amount of support for EOS currently is phenomenal.  Smart Contracts: Solidity, the smart contract language for Ethereum is very close to Javscript and is purpose built for smartcontracts. With the Python version [ https://vyper.readthedocs.io/en/v0.1.0-beta.10/ ] is out, it will be easier to code. EOS supports Webassembly smartcontracts usually written on C++. Technically you can write the code in any language which can compile into WASM though. There are IDEs [ https://www.eosstudio.io/ ] to help. If you are just starting to code contracts, you would be better off with EOS in my opinion.  Scalability: ETH's blocks are produced in ~15 seconds. EOS block time is ~500milli seconds. If you are developing an app for a consumer, you may find EOS closer fit for real-world scenarios. For a better comparison, EOS supports around 1000 TPS (transactions per second) while ETH is at 15TPS. Currently EOS accounts for 68% [ https://www.blocktivity.info/ ] of the blockchain transactions while ETH has 3%. Please note that this is just a comparison. Why EOS has such a massive share has probably much to do with how transactions are designed in EOS.  Cost: dApps built on ethereum need to spend ETH as Ethereum is proof of work currently. The price volatality of ETH stops one from spending it. The cost of transaction in EOS is adjusted by their inflation model. EOS do not charge a transaction fee. It's closer to how our current internet works. So users will be more inclined to use an EOS dApp in the long run as it is cheaper or free. We are currently starting to see this is the case.  Price stability: EOS/USD price is comparatively stable compared to BTC/USD or ETH/USD. Currently BTC is bullish and many alt coins followed suit while EOS is still $5-$8 rages.  EOS's design is more to do with holding it in your own wallet and using it than trading it on exchanges. With the new REX [ https://eosauthority.com/rex_history/ ] in action you can get \\u2018interest' by holding EOS. It's a reasonable passive income opportunity.  Security & Decentralization: Both, ETH's & EOS' security is provided by the network. ETH is protected by a global set of miners. But a miner with more resources can attach more hashpower and weaken the decentralization aspect of Ethereum. The network or an ETH holder cannot stop this from happening. It's the case with Bitcoin as 60% of the hashpower is controlled by just 5 people. EOS is a democratic system. The chain is protected by 21 voted block producers based on Delegated Proof of Stake [ https://twitter.com/mixdev/status/1143769516461023232 ]. Anyone holding EOS in their wallets can vote. A rogue block producer can be voted out simply by EOS account holders not voting them essentially kicking them out from the network. This will reinstate security of the blockchain. EOS has a potential problem of vote buying and other collusion channels. But the point is, the system has means to prevent or be offensive to those who act against the network; a feature Ethereum does not have.  Sustainability & Energy Efficiency: In a way, EOS is more sustainable than ETH. EOS is 17,236 times [ https://eosauthority.com/green/ ] more energy efficient than Ethereum.  EOS block producers run highly efficient server CPUs compared to high power GPUs or ASICs of ETH mining. This cuts down emissions as well as cost by a large margin.

Ethereum is older and uses a language unique to ETH, called Solidity, which is why virtually no apps are being built on Ethereum.  EOS is newer and far better than ETH for this reason, among many.  People who don't understand EOS call it centralized, (that's what ETH zealots have called it in the past), because EOS employs a system called delegated proof of stake (DPOS), which means that 21 block producers are elected by coinholders, and those 21 BPs\\\" have the ability to improve the code whenever they collectively decide it's needed, whereas ETH can't be changed.  EOS is not centralized. It's democratic."}, {"upvote": 5, "content": "Let's take a look at what EOS is aiming to do - EOS's CTO, Daniel Larimer, claims that no blockchain platform can provide the performance that ordinary people want. He claims that ordinary people are more concerned with performance than with decentralization. Larimer's goal with EOS is to develop a platform for decentralized apps that works the way users want them to.  This results in Ethereum being their main competitor! Compared to Ethereum, EOS is attempting to make it easier to develop dApps. EOS is said to require less code than Ethereum because it has more basic capabilities and is easier to learn how to use and navigate. This is critical because the majority of people lack the technical skills required to utilize Ethereum.  HOWEVER - The case to be made about Ethereum is that it is led by a VERY strong development team which is headed by our lord and saviour - Vitalik. The man is a legend and has delivered on just about every promise they made. Ethereum is slowly moving to PoS (proof of stake), which is an amazing move, and there are other good things coming to Ethereum as well.  Personally, I'm an Ethereum stan - but I do think that EOS is a great platform as well, and I'm a firm believer of competition breeds excellence.  There's one more thing that EOS fans supposedly need to worry about - Web 3.0   %3E The arrival of Web 3.0 will inevitably render several networks and technologies obsolete. While critics may be quick to point to EOS as one of the blockchains that will die out, enthusiasts are optimistic that EOS [ https://dailycoin.com/eos-vs-ethereum-2021/ ] may have a fighting chance to survive.  Source: Why EOS Might Actually Survive Web 3.0 \\u2014 DailyCoin [ https://dailycoin.com/why-eos-might-actually-survive-web-3-0/ ] I'm of the mind that it won't be a struggle - EOS won't just survive Web 3.0, it will thrive in Web 3.0. However, I think everyone should read the article linked above for more information on why some people are worried about Web 3.0"}, {"upvote": 3, "content": "You wouldn't ever. Never ever. Here are only a few of the problems that EOS had in the last week (!).  1. ECAF ordered to freeze the hacked accounts, blockchain isn't immutable. many both inside and outside the EOS community aren't clear what ECAF, the main body tasked with resolving disputes between token holders on the network, is and what control it has over transactions. 2. Dan threw out the constitution because it was socially unscalable 3. RAM over-speculation, it currently costs $14 and growing to create an account. Whales cornered the RAM market. 4. Centralized - just 21 BP's that can vote each other in, plutocracy It takes just 17/21 BP to achieve consensus Block.one, who claimed to have no involvement in the launch of the EOS mainnet are now going to use the 10% of the token supply they own to influence the list of block producers. Dan also owns a large amount of the token supply and voting power Some of these block producer candidates in the top 10 came out of nowhere. How they got in the position they are in is pretty obvious \\u2013 they had a lot of tokens (or access to them) and voted themselves in. It's a whales' election. 5. BPs are already forming cartels. Many know each other from the video conference call. Cartel formation enables them to print money and keep themselves in power by voting for each other and buying votes. They can also censor or reverse transactions BP are accumulating EOS and it gives them a stronger vote over time. r/CryptoCurrency - EOS BP\\u00b4s already forming Cartels [ https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8u72na/eos_bps_already_forming_cartels/ ] 6. If you dont vote within 3 years, your tokens get confiscated and redistributed too and you lose everything, can't just hold. (This rule has been removed) 7. An EOS BP is just a corporate-owned server. It can be shut down with a subpoena or by governments However, the biggest problem is simply that EOS is extremely centralized with only 21 consensus nodes and handpicked nodes, while other platforms like Cardano and Elastos are near infinitely decentralized through side-chains/off-chain/horizontal scaling or IOTA and Nano through simply a smart architecture.  It all comes down to being permissioned and non-trustless. That leads to the following, insurmountable problems.  1. 1 person is in charge and can change the constitution at will. This wouldn't be so bad in a trustless and permissionless platform, but wreaks havoc in a non trustless and permissioned platform. Also if it were several people in charge that have to write a constitution, it's even worse, because writing a constitution with many people is always victim of special interests, lobbying and the like. 2. A design that doesn't prevent cartel formation. Cartels always happen if it is possible. 3. If the security of a network relies on 1 person, it can't get mass adoption, because that person has to be 1. perfect. Unfortunately, he isn't perfect, because he has made a very bad constitution. Thus, he isn't really good at that. Furthermore, he can never leave the project, can get sick, or die, because a complex constitution sometimes needs and update "}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/Is-Canon-EOS-60D-a-full-frame-camera", "question": "Is Canon EOS 60D a full frame camera", "answers": [{"upvote": 2, "content": "No, Canon EOS 60D is not a full-frame camera.

I didn't have any lip balm made up because my daughter takes a new one every day. She must be selling them on eBay. Just kidding.  Anyway, I scooped some shea butter into a little tin and told her to use it.  A couple of days later my son told me that she said it was the best lip balm she's ever used and won't ever use anything else again.  Obviously I told her that it was raw shea butter and not an actual product.  Try it yourself. Get the unrefined stuff. I buy 5kg for \\u00a335.  It is amazing for feet and hands too, just direct straight out of the tub.  Here's a recipe for a nice light body butter you can make easily yourself. It will spread easily and soak in quickly.  70% Shea Butter  30% Oil.  You can use Sweet Almond Oil/Macadamia Nut Oil/ Grapeseed Oil which are nice light oils. Or you can go for something heavier like hemp or even olive oil. Sunflower oil is nice too.  In a double boiler melt your shea and oil together. Stir and refrigerate.  As it starts to set up after 30mins or so whisk it with an electric whisk. I use a hand held one.  Pop back in the fridge and whisk again at regular intervals.  Once it is fully cooled you can whisk it until it is double in size and looks like souffl\\u00e9.  Tip. For a less greasy feeling you can a little cornstarch or arrowroot starch during the mixing stages. It really makes a difference. Go with 1tsp per 200g to see how you like the skin feel.
