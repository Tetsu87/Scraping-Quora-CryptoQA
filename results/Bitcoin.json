Buying one in 2010 at 0.08$ a coin would now make you 14000$ a coin for every coin that you bought. Which means if you invested 100$ into Bitcoins in 2010 they would be worth a whopping 17.5 million dollars today.  Are bitcoins the future? Or are they going to crash and burn?  Instead of telling you to invest in it or not, what I'm going to do is outline some facts about bitcoin as an investment and tell you about what happened with bubbles in the past. And then you can decide.  Flashback no. 1  The Dot com bubble, 2000  Fueled by the rise of companies with a .com after their name, the .com bubble saw the price of the NASDAQ jump from 1000 to 5000 over 5 years. This was a 500% increase and was fueled by purely speculative investments.  Fundamentals were thrown away. People were rushing to buy any internet based company, ignoring the fact that these companies wouldn't be making any money for the next few years. Money was cheap. Funding was easy. A bubble was formed.  And like all bubbles, it burst in 2001. Companies that had a market capitalization of hundreds of millions were now worth 0. The stock market rapidly declined. Trillions of dollars of investors money was lost.  Flashback no. 2  The housing bubble, 2006/2007  After the recession the .com bubble caused, interest rates started to drop. Investors abandoned the stock market and turned to real estate. Lending requirements all but vanished. Housing prices started to go up. Speculators entered the market and made tens of thousands of dollars in weeks. A bubble was formed.  And like all bubbles, it burst in 2007/2008 with the collapse of Lehmann Brothers, causing the largest recession in history since World War II. Millions of dollars were lost. Homes were destroyed. It took the economy years to recover.  What is the definition of a bubble in finance?  A bubble occurs when the price of a stock or investment is driven up to unsustainably high levels, substantially way more than what that item is worth. This bubble is usually caused by emotions of the masses, and not by logical investing or looking at fundamentals. And it always starts off as something that made sense in the beginning.  Its exactly the same with Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin has jumped 18,749,900% since 2010. It made sense to invest in it a few years ago. It was secure, unregulated and cryptocurrency seems like the future. But does it make sense to invest in it now?  Yes, Bitcoin has its pros. It's unregulated. Decentralized. Operates on Blockchain technology. But it's also unregulated(see what I did there?). Has no intrinsic value. And it's highly volatile.  Look, I might even be wrong. There are people that have forecasted the price of Bitcoin to hit 100,000$ a coin in ten years.  But I'm going to stay out of it. Warren Buffett has warned against it. Jamie Dimon has warned against it. Alan Greenspan compared it to gambling in Las Vegas.  If you must invest in it, remember the golden rule of investing - Never invest more than what you're willing to lose. If you absolutely must, no more than 10% of your portfolio must be invested in risky assets.  Like the famous economist Paul Samuelson once said, Investing should be like watching paint dry and watching grass grow. If you want excitement, take 100$ and go to Vegas.  EDIT: I seem to have gotten a lot of backlash for this answer. Guys, I understand were you all are coming from and I agree, 100%. Blockchain IS revolutionary. Cryptos are well designed to be the future of payments, and Blockchain is definitely not going away. But, this itself is not a reason to buy Bitcoin!  This has happened in the past as well with Airline industries and tech industries. Yes, some of them have done well, exceedingly well. But that's because they were good companies, with solid fundamentals and a good management team! It has nothing to do with the fact that they were the future.  This answer is ONLY about whether you should make an investment in Bitcoin or not. Blockchain is an exceedingly innovative and futuristic technology, no doubt about that.  I'm going to end this with a quote from Benjamin Graham, widely regarded as one of the best Investors of our time. Obvious prospects for physical growth in an industry do not translate into obvious prospects for investors.  EDIT 2: For all the haters in the comments:  This answer was first drafted when Bitcoin was at 14,000 USD a coin. The price of Bitcoin is now 6758 USD a coin.  Once again - Obvious prospects for physical growth in an industry do not translate into obvious prospects for investors.  Cheers.  EDIT 3: Almost one year after writing this answer:  The price of bitcoin is now 3704 USD a coin. It has fallen roughly 10,000 USD since this answer was written."}, {"upvote": 6, "content": "Experts remain conflicted on whether bitcoin has bottomed out yet.

Bitcoin has gone mainstream. There are some people who hate me for it.  I'm getting quite a few people all asking me the same question: Is it too late to invest in bitcoin?  I don't think it is. Bitcoin is a paradigm shift in a world that is high on worthless currency printed in excess. The only way to fund our excessive lifestyles is to increase the global debt and pay for it with money printed out of thin air.  My approach to bitcoin is different. It's a little less drastic. I've been playing with it for years and have become fascinated by it. The rewards for me understanding bitcoin are now over 17,900%+ on the initial investment.  I don't think I've ever made another investment like it. It's likely I will never make another investment like it for the rest of my life. There may never be another investment like it.  The unfortunate psychological challenge when you buy something that performs beyond your wildest dreams is you think to yourself, I should have bought more. You can always want more and spend more. But it doesn't matter. Money has never made me happy. The same is likely true for you.  So how do you manage your psychology when bitcoin mania is sweeping the world and it has gone mainstream? How do you cope when it's trending on twitter, on the front page of every newspaper, being promoted by some of the biggest wall street tycoons in the world, like Paul Tudor Jones?  First, you stay calm.  You're never late to anything in life. You're right on time.  What bitcoin has done to date is irrelevant. If you haven't bought any or don't understand it then that's not the issue. The issue is whether you are openminded enough to rethink everything you know about money and investing. If you are, there is opportunity.  If your mind is closed, the world is closed, and so are the opportunities.  When I first heard about bitcoin , I thought it was a joke. I made fun of my work colleagues who were buying a sandwich with half a bitcoin and loving life.  Bitcoin is extremely weird  The trouble with bitcoin is it's not easy to understand. When people don't understand a concept they quickly dismiss it and call it a scam so they don't feel stupid.   * There are 21 million coins.  * You can't create more coins.  * The coins are digital.  * The coins are only safe if you take them off the internet  * Bitcoin is a way to store value. It's not currently used as a currency to transact with and may never fulfill that need.  * Bitcoin is a way to protect the value you create, with code humans can't manipulate to pay for a covid crisis or a recession.  * Bitcoin is a hedge. This means it's the opposite of everything else you can put your money into. Owning both sides of a marketplace de-risks you. If you only invest your money in one thing, then if that asset has a downturn and never recovers, you lose the lot.  * Bitcoin is an investment in an unknown, distant future. Like I said, bitcoin isn't normal. It confuses people and that's what it was designed to do.  The worst way to invest as an everyday person is for the short term. One of my early investments in bitcoin was short term. I bought a lot and then sold it when the price crashed in 2017. That short-term thinking has meant I'm working a few years longer than I need to.  I would be retired if I still had all the bitcoin I owned in 2017. I'm okay with that. My investor psychology was weak back then. I needed to see a few 50% drops to learn my lesson. The March 2020 covid crash was certainly a good test, and I passed without selling any bitcoin.  Thinking about the assets you invest in over the long term helps reduce your stress levels. You're less worried about whether it's too late or is now a good time and focused on doing your research and understanding what you're buying. This phrase sums it up better than I could.  It's not time to panic. It's time to digitally upgrade your financial education.  Physical cash in your wallet and nuggets of gold you take inside with a wheelbarrow is the pre-digital financial world. The world of money is a long way behind advances in technology.  Bitcoin is trying to catch the financial world up with the digital narrative, so we can use the phone in our pocket to go about our day and store our money without its value being secretly eroded away and taxed by inflation, by the pinstripe suit club.  If you've been thinking about bitcoin, do your research. Go down the rabbit hole. Avoid FOMO. Stay away from the hype. Understand the problem it solves, intimately. Get to know bitcoin like you would a new lover you invite into your bed to shag.  The best time to buy bitcoin is when you understand it and see its value."}, {"upvote": 1763, "content": "I could either watch it happen or be a part of it.  https://t.me/+wv62vHY93zg4N2U0 "}, {"upvote": 173, "content": "Venture capitalists have poured tons of money into the Bitcoin ecosystem.

First, we need to define what investment is. Investing assumes holding a financial asset for profit purposes for a substantial time. It could be some financial assets that allow investors to get regular payments, like dividends, from it. There are a variety of investment instruments available to ordinary people nowadays.  Only three decades ago, the world of investments belonged to a higher caste of people. The trading process of financial entities was implemented by qualified traders only at special places like Wall Street, London Stock Exchange etc. With the development of the internet, financial markets became accessible to the general public. This proliferation can be ambiguous in the sense that the trading opportunity itself is a good thing. However, the level of traders' expertise became relatively low. There is a spectrum of traders on one trading platform, from complete amateurs to high-level pros coexisting with each other. And the latter are outnumbered, as you may understand. This lack of knowledge can lead to false analysis conclusions and significant losses as a result.  The Internet brought us not only trading opportunities. The last decade was a decade of digital currency. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and thousands or maybe even hundreds of thousands of crypto coins, tokens, and NFTs emerged from nowhere. Some are complete scams, and some are born to vanish in oblivion. But there are definitely names worth our attention for the investing prospects.  Bitcoin and its investing capacity.  Cryptocurrency as an investment asset is very young compared to others, so its predictive potential is still unstable. From an investing point of view, Bitcoin is not a great instrument; it is too volatile. Also, the reason that limits the investments in Bitcoin is that the Bitcoin network has no scalability to it. It's not going to expand into something bigger than just the Bitcoin transaction network.  For instance, if we take XRP, it is a coin of the Ripple payment network accepted by more than 100 financial institutions worldwide. Among them are:  * Santander;  * SBI Remit;  * Credit Agricole;  * Siam Commercial Bank;  * SEB etc.  Some say Bitcoin has a potential to be an alternative currency for the US economy in the future. Maybe, if we talk about decades, it is possible. Through all these decades, Bitcoin will rise and fall so many times. This is not very valuable for us as investors. For now, we need to establish what is the best strategy for dealing with Bitcoin. It can hardly be viewed as an investing tool, but it can be viable as a long-term trading instrument.  There will be a possibility to buy it in the near future at the lowest price in the prospect that it will grow to the all-time highs of November of 2021at the very least.  The thing is that every four years, so-called Bitcoin halving happening. What is this? Basically, it's the control mechanism of cryptocurrency inflation by reducing the number of coins in the system.  When you reduce the amount of some assets, it creates scarcity. Scarcity makes prices of this asset go up. Something like this will happen in the period of the upcoming two years. Next, Bitcoin halving is planned to occur in March of 2024. By that time, the current Bitcoin bearish market will end. We can expect the rise of Bitcoin and all the cryptocurrencies along with it. It's no secret that literally all crypto coins and tokens, major or minor, are heavily correlated with Bitcoin price. According to the previous halvings price range, we can predict that the next Bitcoin halving will be followed by a Bitcoin take-off to the $100,000 price tag.  This strategy is not an investment in the broad sense. Trading assumes buying at the lows and selling at the highs. The next Bitcoin 4 year cycle will also consist of two indispensable parts: bullish and bearish. When the bullish part will come to an end Bitcoin assets should be sold."}, {"upvote": 22, "content": "Yes you should"}, {"upvote": 1776, "content": "Should I invest in Bitcoin?"}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/Is-bitcoin-worth-investing-in", "question": "Is bitcoin worth investing in", "answers": [{"upvote": 1866, "content": "Bitcoin is the beginning of something great: a currency without a government, something necessary and imperative.  https://t.me/+wv62vHY93zg4N2U0 "}, {"upvote": 1831, "content": "Bitcoin is the beginning of something great: a currency without a government, something necessary and imperative.  https://t.me/+wv62vHY93zg4N2U0 "}, {"upvote": 1799, "content": "What I will say about crypto and NFTs in general is I really love the idea of creators owning their media and owning their content.  https://t.me/+wv62vHY93zg4N2U0 "}, {"upvote": 1727, "content": "I think bitcoin is on the verge of getting broad acceptance by conventional finance people.  https://t.me/+wv62vHY93zg4N2U0 "}, {"upvote": 218, "content": "Bitcoin at $9700!!!

U.S. and other countries stepping in to regulate the use of bitcoin (like in China)  2. If bitcoin is found to have been used for terrorist or illegal activities such as human trafficking  3. Baby boomers at risk of losing their retirement incomes  A global currency might sound like an incredible idea - but it needs some form of regulation.

Look at the Forbes 400 and you will see long term investors accrue much more wealth over time than traders.  My own wealth building formula is simple.

Now, the bank cashier will make a note of the transaction, either in a cash register or an online data sheet. He will give it a transaction number, and also note down the name of the two parties involved.  Understand the fact that whenever you transfer money, the bank is the third party which gets involved to note down the credentials of the transaction.  What if there was no bank required to make a transaction?  So, when Batman transfers money to Hulk through Bitcoins, all the information related to it is handled by a blockchain.  A block chain is a digital ledger in which transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are recorded chronologically and publicly.  It is a continuously growing list of records, which has the time stamps and transaction data.  Now, to maintain the block chain, or the list of records you need a network.

Its balance is kept on a decentralized public ledger (also called blockchain), which can be accessed by everyone, thereby providing unprecedented transparency. A massive amount of computing power verifies all Bitcoin transactions.  * Bitcoin: What you can do with it? You can:  *   * Create or mine Bitcoin  * Distribute Bitcoin  * Trade Bitcoin  * Store Bitcoin   * What's so Special?  *   * Absolutely Decentralized: The most exciting thing about Bitcoin (denoted as BTC) is that unlike government-issued currencies it is not issued or backed by any government or bank.  * High Popularity Despite being Legal Tenders: Though they are not legal tenders, they are very high in popularity among investors. It is the increasing popularity of Bitcoin that led to the launch of around 5,000 other altcoins.  * Lower Transaction Fees: BTC promises to lower transaction fees than any other traditional online payment mechanism.   * Understanding Bitcoin in Simple Words Bitcoins are a collection of nodes (master nodes and simple nodes) that are nothing but computers. These computers run the code of Bitcoin and consequently store its blockchain.  Each blockchain is a collection of blocks. Each block, in turn, is a collection of transactions. The best thing about this system is its transparency, making it unlikely for anyone (including those who started it) to cheat the system.  All the computers that run the blockchain have the same block and transaction list. Everyone (whether they run a node or not) can see the new Bitcoin transactions occurring live and filling up the blocks one after the other. Cheating this system is unlikely.  Does that mean no one can cheat the Bitcoin System?  If a bad actor has to carry out a nefarious action, he/she has to operate 51% of the computing power that makes up the Bitcoin. As of May 2020, there are 47,000 nodes. Therefore, cheating this elaborate system is highly unlikely.  Now, suppose a bad actor carries out an attack. In such a case, the people who are running the nodes or the computers will most probably carry out a fork to a new blockchain. This will make the attack a wastage of time, resources, and effort of the bad actor.   * Should you invest in Bitcoin? Why? Absolutely. What are you waiting for? You should invest now because of the following reasons:   * Outstanding Prospect of Growth in 2021 Almost all analysts are predicting a bull run in 2021 as they are expecting the mass adoption of BTC in the near future.   * Nexo co-founder Antoni Trenchev has said that by 2021-end, the Bitcoin price is expected to rise to $50,000.  * A respected on-chain analyst has said that one of his economic models a 10-time price appreciation to around $200,000-to-$300,000 by 2021-end or early 2022.  * Many analysts believe that the next most logical target is the US$24,800 Fib level (just below US$25,000).  * Phenomenal Performance in 2020 Bitcoin price has increased by around 170% in 2020. If we consider the lows during the COVID-19 crash in March 2020, the bounceback is phenomenal. Since the lows of March, the BTC price against the US Dollar has increased by around 400%.   * JPMorgan Analysts believe BTC will Present Itself as an Alternative to Gold in terms of Store of Value A Bloomberg report says that the analysts of JPMorgan investment bank believe that BTC will continue to gain traction and may present a bear case for gold.  The adoption of bitcoin by institutional investors has only begun, while for gold its adoption by institutional investors is very advanced.  Billions of dollars worth of investment can potentially flow from gold to Bitcoin. Therefore, in the coming time, the gold may lose its shine as BTC's prospects brighten.   * 62% Market Capitalization On December 10, 2020, the market cap of Bitcoin was US$341,785,729,235, out of the total global market capitalization of US$546,541,275,989. BTC's market share is 62%, the highest in the cryptocurrency market. Its price movement largely defines the overall movement of the market.   * Big Players are Investing Heavily  *   * Big-time investors such as BlackRock's Rick Rieder, Paul Tudor Jones, Stanley Druckenmiller, and Bill Miller are parking more and more of their capital in Bitcoin and other altcoins.  * Payment companies such as PayPal and Square are continuing to funnel more retail capital into Bitcoin and other cryptos.   * Big Players are Buying at Lows Unlike 2017's bear run (when the BTC value tanked to 3,500-level), this time it'll be decent corrections. On December 9, 2020, the BTC/USD pair breached the US$18,000 level and moved downwards to US$17,640.56 and at one point in time exchange data showed buyer interest lined up at the US$16,200-level.  When asked about the prospects of the Bitcoin market, Cointelegraph Markets analyst Micha\\u00ebl van de Poppe and many others said that their overall estimate is positive because many big investors including Grayscale, Paypal, Square, MicroStrategy, and many others are buying at lower levels as the small crypto traders, shitcoiners, and weak hands sell-off.  They believe the downtrend will continue until the US$18,500-18,700 level is reclaimed. Currently, the BTC/USD price is revolving around US$18,022.35. So, time your entry by checking the technical charts and you'll most definitely reap the benefit in the coming year.   * Can I invest US$100 to buy Bitcoin? Yes, you can buy a portion of a single Bitcoin. However, always keep in mind that you've to give a certain commission for purchasing BTC. If you are paying US$10 for buying US$10,000 of Bitcoin, it means you are just paying 0.1% in fees. However, if you give US$10 fees for buying US$100 Bitcoin, you're 10% in fees. While investing US$100, you should keep this thing in mind. This will help you make an informed and better entry into the market and invest properly.

Will the Russians use Bitcoin as a work around?    While that is a very complicated question involving global finance, geo-political tensions and war, I got a good answer from smart, young Thai woman with simple, but meaningful, insights into the developing world of crypto currencies.  The digital networks Bitcoin and other crypto currencies use are not capable of handling the volume of traffic required to replace the matrix of global finance systems. Blockchains - the digital networks crypto currencies operate on - have not developed sufficiently to provide the speed and volume necessary for the high the amount of transactions required for global money transfers.    In this essay I will attempt to explain what Bitcoin and other crypto currencies are in an easy to understand manner. I will also propose that the reason crypto currency networks have not developed into a fast, high volume system capable of moving money efficiently is because of equity speculation. Bitcoin billionaires have inadvertently prevented the development of what the creators of Bitcoin initially envisioned: a global digital currency devoid of a central authority.    If you wish to ride on a New York City subway, you might purchase a Metro Card.  Simply pay for your Metro Card at an electronic kiosk and the machine will transfer the value of your money and digitally encode the value onto the Metro Card. Your Metro Card now digitally stores the value of your money until you spend it by boarding a train. Metro Cards have limited use. You cannot buy a cup of coffee with a Metro Card. However, in Bangkok, Thailand where I live, the Rabbit Card, Bangkok's version of a Metro Card, can be used at a few merchants.  Bitcoin is similar to a Metro Card. An individual can purchase a Bitcoin (or a portion of a Bitcoin) and the value is noted on a digital network called a blockchain. Blockchains are unique in that they have solved a very difficult problem, how to prevent fraud and counterfeits. They do that basically with thousands of computers that monitor the blockchain. But unlike a Metro Card that has a fixed value, Bitcoin's value is determined by an open market. The pioneers of Bitcoin acquired Bitcoins for pennies. Many of those early adopters of Bitcoin became billionaires when the price of Bitcoin soared in open market exchanges. While the early conversation about Bitcoin was how it could replace traditional currency as a method of transferring value, that changed.  Investors began buying Bitcoin and the focus, the narrative, became all about the value of Bitcoin. Stories abounded about the billions of dollars early investors made by buying Bitcoin. Demand for Bitcoins increased motivating technically savvy entrepreneurs to set up online exchanges or brokers. First dozens, now hundreds of other crypto-coins or tokens emerged. With billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin and other coins changing hands by way of blockchain technology, government finance oversight entities became interested and created regulations governing blockchain transactions. The original idea of an anonymous transaction between two parties became an afterthought.    In 2017, I became aware of a surge in the price of Bitcoin in South Korea. Because of high local demand, eager South Korean speculators were paying 30% more for Bitcoin than in Bangkok where I live. When illogical price differences happen in a market, say the stock market, there is an opportunity for savvy traders to make a quick profit. Buy in the low market; sell in the high. It is a simple idea stock traders call arbitrage. At the time I knew little about Bitcoin. But this apparent arbitrage opportunity motivated me to learn about Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain network.    Simply put, blockchain is a large collection of computers that monitor the blockchain system and double check transactions on that system. Those computers compete to be the computer that verifies the transaction. The successful computer, and its human maintainer, get a commission from the transaction.  There are ways to buy Bitcoin from an individual. Crypto enthusiast call transactions between individuals peer to peer. A person can install an app on their smartphone. By scanning a QR code of another person's app, parties can transfer all or part of the value of a Bitcoin from one person to another, peer to peer. However, most holders of crypto currency I was meeting bought and sold their holdings through a central exchange such as Coinbase.     What you are actually buying is a digital notation on the blockchain. All you receive is an identifying number. Do not loose it.  The key to success in an arbitrage transaction is execution. Arbitrage traders in the stock market work in specialized environments where intrenched market players can sometimes execute quick trades to exploit a market imbalance. While I was reading stories on social media about people profiting by making arbitrage trades with Bitcoin in South Korea, I realized quickly that I did not have the network necessary to execute such trades.    Exchanges such as Coinbase have cross border limitations and high fees. While I knew people in Bangkok from whom I could have executed a peer to peer purchase, in Korea, I would have to seek them out. And while that may not have been too difficult given the hot market, it takes six hours to fly from Bangkok to Seoul.    The price of Bitcoin, then and now, is volatile. Thirty percent price swings are common. I could buy Bitcoin in Bangkok and when I got off the plane in Seoul, my investment may have dropped dramatically in value while I was enjoying my expensive plane ride. I opted out of a Bitcoin arbitrage scheme, but became very interested in blockchain concepts, ideas and technology.  Let me dispel one lingering myth about crypto-currency. Blockchain transactions are not untraceable or anonymous. The digital notations on the blockchain are public, a necessary element in the process of preventing duplicate transactions, fraud and counterfeits. These digital notations are identified by encrypted codes known only to the holders of the digital notations. But using AI data analysis and other surveillance, sophisticated parties can determine transaction sources when motivated to do so. If you want to purchase something and be truly untraceable and anonymous, use cash.  The volatility present in the crypto currency market is exacerbated by a feature first touted as a benefit of Bitcoin: there is a limited supply of Bitcoin, by design. The limit in supply theoretically prevents inflation. In the current volatile market of crypto currency, a construct such as inflation is not relevant. The value of goods and services rise, inflate, in relationship to a currency. A stable price has yet to be established from which its purchasing power would be deflated. If your crypto holdings go up and down dramatically, there is no logical way to determine an inflationary relationship with goods and services one might purchase with crypto.  When a big holder of Bitcoin sells one hundred million dollars of their holdings, that one transaction will affect the price. The market will go down. If a currency trader of US dollars sold one hundred million dollars worth of the US dollar for English pounds, the currency market - measured in hundreds of billions of dollars a day - would not even register the transaction. The lack of depth in the Bitcoin market, its limited supply, adds to the volatile price swings.  And here is where things get strange. The limited supply of Bitcoin, along with a cabal of early holders owning a significant proportion of the supply, creates an opportunity for market manipulation. Many of these early holders, called whales in the crypto orbit, accumulated large fortunes in the early rise of the value of Bitcoin. And they can easily make the market rise or fall by simply trading with themselves, a practice I have long suspected. Bloomberg News recently uncovered such an inside trade with a new blockchain product, non-fungible tokens, NFTs.  NFTs are digital art works now becoming a trendy new use of blockchain. An NFT held by the Trump organization recently sold for over one million dollars. Bloomberg's investigation showed the buyer was Melania Trump. The much heralded million dollar transaction falsely suggested there was a real market trading NFTs. While such a trade in US securities would be illegal, NFTs are not yet regulated. The Trump NFT transaction is legal. But it is also a clear indicator of how whales can manipulate the crypto market.  Bitcoin and other tokens have moved away from the original idea of a digital currency, or mechanism of exchange, to a simple store of value. Some early adopters are now paper billionaires. That kind of wealth is a magnet for others trying to get in on the new investment idea. Digital currencies, however, do not have any underlying value. The price of ownership of digital currencies has risen (and fallen) simply from demand. If the price dropped to zero, a distinct possibility according to many financiers such as Warren Buffet, holders of crypto currency would have nothing. By comparison, ownership of stocks means you have a share of a company. Even is the company went bankrupt, shareholders would get a share of the liquidation. Bonds have similar protections. While big looses are possible in stocks and bonds, holders of such instruments posses a portion of the tangible assets underlying those instruments. There are no tangible assets underlying crypto currency. Warren Buffett's partner, Charlie Munger, is very vocal about his objection to idea of crypto currency. He believes the current value of crypto currency is nothing more than a speculative bubble that is bound to pop.  In The Netherlands, in 1637 the price of forward contracts on tulip bulbs , a contract to buy or sell in the future, rose to a very high price. Exuberant demand created history's first recorded finance bubble. When the bubble popped, people holding the contracts went broke.  In 1929, a highly inflated stock market crashed in large part due to trading on margin. Margin trading is where stock holders borrow against their stock holdings. The bubble once again popped. Traders were jumping out windows.  In 2007, finance instruments called Credit Default Swaps (CDS) and Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDO) propped up global real estate markets. The value of CDOs and CDSs soared. Once again the bubble popped sending the world into the Great Recession.  Did these finance catastrophes cause traders to discontinue buying and selling the offending finance instruments?    Of course not!    Margin trading is currently huge. CDSs and CDOs trade in trillions of dollars, and forward contracts on commodities are common. Additionally, when the tulip contracts crashed, the holders still had pretty flowers. The question to ask about crypto currency is if and when the speculative mania now dominating digital currencies goes away, will there be any underlying value?  The answer is a firm yes. But the value will not be in tangible assets such as real estate, company shares or tulips. It is the blockchain network itself that very well may transform the global movement of money.  Mook is a smart twenty-two year old Thai woman I met at a Bitcoin Cash meetup in Bangkok last year. Bitcoin Cash is a digital currency spinoff of Bitcoin. Mook and a few other young people were approaching local Bangkok merchants, mostly bars, restaurants and hotels and encouraging the proprietors to accept Bitcoin Cash as payment method. Mook and her entourage of good looking young folks would show the prospective merchants the ease with which they could download an app onto their smart phone and right away begin transferring value to and from other Bitcoin Cash holders. A resurgence of COVID closed Thailand to tourists and put a stop to Mook's efforts. The ultimate users of Bitcoin Cash, Mook's target consumers, were tourists. There are not many Thais buying crypto currency.  Mook confirmed her friends' efforts promoting Bitcoin Cash were funded by Roger Ver, a Bitcoin Whale. Mook was quick to point out that she was not paid.  \\u2026I'm not funded by Roger. I know some people that got funded by him but I just do it on my own\\\", declared Mook.  Roger pivoted his focus away from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash and is now the man behind the curtain pulling the levers of promotion for Bitcoin Cash. From my observation of Mook and her crew's efforts last year, the objective of this Roger Ver backed enterprise is indeed attempting to get Bitcoin Cash established as a usable currency in retail establishments. I am wondering though if there exist a natural tension between the holder of valuable equity and a functional crypto currency. They might be mutually exclusive states. If the market value of Bitcoin Cash drops dramatically and erodes a managing whale's fortune, would that not shift their efforts toward maintaining their fortune?  A year has passed since Mook and her Bitcoin Cash crew were promoting the use of crypto currency in Thai retail businesses. I had a long, pleasant conversation over coffee with Mook about her perspective on the use of crypto currency going forward. With impressive insight into finance realities, Mook wrapped up our conversation saying that she, and other middle class Thais, would never buy crypto currency as an investment. It is too volatile and risky. But Mook would use crypto currency as money if a fast, reliable network becomes available.  Another businessman I know well here in Bangkok has been working on developing cross border micro-payment systems using blockchain since 2014. This gentleman, let's call him Stan, worked at high levels in the crypto-currency world until recently when he formed his own company. Stan was frustrated with how holders of crypto currency focused their attention on maintaining equity rather than developing payment networks. Now on his own with a few partners, Stan hopes to maintain that focus, getting the blockchain developed as a usable network rather than a speculation device. When I asked Stan if he thought the turmoil in the movement of money caused by the Ukraine crisis might be an interruption to the status quo that might change the path of blockchain development, Stan shrugged.    Nobody knows the answer."}, {"upvote": 35, "content": "Currency is money. It has some value. It can be exchanged for goods and services. It can be used to maintain a record of the cost of these goods and services. Earlier we had Gold and other metals as currency. It was later replaced by Paper currency. Now we have Credit Cards.  Whenever we give a bill or note (paper currency), the shopkeepers accepts it. They know that they can spend this money again to purchase from some one else. We carry this money in our wallets. We use it wherever we want too. We can use it in the middle of the night. The seller gets paid immediately.  Then came credit cards and digital payments. Now you are ranked based upon a score. Banks track your every transaction. They may or may not allow you to do a particular transaction. Credit card companies hold up shopkeeper's funds for months.  Some people decided to create a new form of currency i.e Bitcoin. It is supposed to work as cash i.e. paper currency. Any person can create a wallet. He can load his wallets with Bitcoins and spend at his will. You can purchase it via Dollars, Rupees, Pounds, Yen etc. There is fluctuation in the price of USD/INR, USD/GBP and others depending upon a countries growth, demand for their currency, their expenditure etc. Similarly, the price of Bitcoin fluctuates with its development, adoption, innovation, and usage.  Second thing Satoshi Nakamoto wanted was to create a system where no bank or government can control Bitcoin. He achieved by making it decentralised. He published the paper about Bitcoin and asked people to help him with development. Like other open source softwares, developers update Bitcoins. These developers do not work for any body. They write code because they believe Bitcoin can change the world. Hundreds of different developers around the world write and review Bitcoin code and make it more secure and easy for people to use.  Banks have their own centralised servers. They may maintain a copy of these servers in different places just to avoid any downtime. We have seen in past how these banks can be hacked and millions of Dollars are poured out of people's accounts. In Bitcoin, the server is maintained by thousands of computers around the globes. These computers are owned by people like us. Each of these computers have a copy of ledger. The ledger has records of all the transactions that happened with Bitcoin. If somebody needs to hack the Bitcoin, he will have to hack all these computers at once.  Now we have a system of unknown and unrelated people who want to transact with each other without the help of any third party. Someone needs to verify these transactions. There are miners which run huge servers for Bitcoin. The purpose of these servers is to verify each transaction and write it in the ledger. As this is an extensive process and requires a lot of computation power, miners get paid for verifying transactions.  There is no single person or group of persons who control the Bitcoins. There are many stakeholders. These are people like us. They want to see a new economic system in the world as they believe the current one is broken and outdated. These people do not know each other. They work because they believe in Bitcoins.  Legality of Bitcoin is a topic of debate. Many countries recognise Bitcoin but they have not yet declared it as a legal payment method. Japan now identifies Bitcoin as a legal tender. We have Bitcoin ATMs in US, Singapore, Canada and Europe. We have strict Bitcoin rules in China. India is still not decided on its stance on Bitcoin.  TLDR; Bitcoin is a digital cash. It works just like your online wallets. You can send money in your online wallet to your friends, buy stuff online and offline. It is completely online and works 24x7. Bitcoin was created by an anonymous person or group of persons known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Now a group of developers (mostly volunteers) and miners help run the network."}, {"upvote": 94, "content": "Bitcoin is a form of electronic, permissionless, peer-to-peer money.  What's the idea behind it?  The idea behind digital money was to create a way to exchange value with the help of the internet. Doing it, people would be able to send and receive money worldwide feeless and without the friction of any intermediaries.  At first, Bitcoin solved the trust problem. Apart from the fact that people can transact money directly over the internet with no intermediaries involved, they can also participate in developing the network trying to make it more secure. Thus, Satoshi disappeared being confident that the development of the network would continue.  One of the unique features of BTC is the absence of the leader, as all changes are made through consensus among all network participants. The Bitcoin ecosystem has a large open source developer community, who contribute research, peer review, testing, documentation, and translation. Moreover, according to Electric Capital research conducted in Dec, 2020, it is expanding, having 70%+ more developers than it did 3 years ago.  Though, Bitcoin has done a long way to its primary purpose.  At first, Bitcoin was traded for only a few cents and was mainly used for things like gambling.  In 2010, the first online crypto exchange Mt. Gox, was opened.  Later, Silk Road (a dark web marketplace for buying and selling drugs) stated using BTC as a method of payment.  With the increase of use, BTC's price hit $1 for the first time in spring 2011. It caught the attention of early investors and speculators.  New cryptocurrencies were created to compete with BTC or solve other problems. They were called altcoins, as alternatives to Bitcoin.  Though the FBI shut down the Silk Road in 2013, it showcased the promise of Bitcoin as a digital payment method.  In March 2014, Mt.Gox went bankrupt following a massive hack.  Despite the closure of the Silk Road and the collapse of Mt. Gox the crypto space kept expanding.  Now there are a lot of pro-crypto people and yet companies accepting Bitcoins, who believe that BTC can alter a global economy with digital money, changing it for the better.   How does Bitcoin work?  Since Bitcoin is decentralized, volunteers who are called \\\"miners\\\" constantly verify and update the blockchain. As soon as a specific amount of transactions are verified, another block is added to the blockchain.  BTC's system rewards successful miners with bitcoins. The reward changes over time, halving about every four years. The current reward for a new block of verified transactions is 6.25 BTC. By reducing the rewards of mining bitcoin, halving ensures that the amount of bitcoin in circulation does not increase exponentially, which also tends to put upward pressure on its price.  The algorithm works like this: you create a transaction =%3E it is added to the network and sent to miners =%3E they confirm it =%3E your funds have successfully been sent.  Is Bitcoin Legal?  Bitcoin ownership and mining are legal in more countries than not. Some examples of places where it is illegal are Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Bolivia, Ecuador, Nepal, and Pakistan.\\ufeff Overall, Bitcoin use and mining are legal across much of the globe.   How did it appear?  Since the code for Bitcoin may have been written in 2007, the first known sign of it came out in August 2008, when the domain name for \\\"http://bitcoin.org [ http://bitcoin.org/ ]\\\" was registered.  Bitcoin was introduced to the world by a person under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in October 2008 when he posted a paper  [ https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf ]titled \\\"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\\\" to the cryptography mailing list. The Bitcoin white paper is not only considered the most seminal piece of work in the cryptocurrency movement, it also gave birth to a transformative technology called blockchain.  \\ud83d\\udc46 It is interesting to know that he has never intended to invent a currency. In his announcement of Bitcoin in late 2008, Satoshi said that he developed \\\"A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\\\" only.  On 3rd Jan 2009, he mined the first block called \\\"Genesis\\\" with the text: \\\"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\\\"  It refers to a headline in The Times newspaper from the same date. It's possible that Nakamoto just picked the first headline he saw in the nearest paper. However, crypto enthusiasts tend to agree it's a statement of intent. The financial crisis of 2008 was still unraveling, and it's assumed that Bitcoin was a reaction to the widespread anger and frustration at the current financial system.  9th Jan 2009, Nakamoto announced Bitcoin version 0.1 in his \\\"White Paper\\\" to the cryptography mailing list.  12th Jan 2009: Nakamoto does the first Bitcoin transaction to Hal Finney, who was heavily involved in the community, advocating for the use of cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies.  In 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto officially stopped communicating. Between this period, the Bitcoins existing on the blockchain ledger, have not been used or spent. It proves how much Satoshi owns.  Having disappeared, Satoshi officially decentralized the network for good. Nakamoto created their last forum post on 12th December and continued occasionally responding to emails for a little longer, staying in touch with BTC developer Gavin Andresen until at least April.  Satoshi Nakamoto last message on the Bitcoin Forum  Nakamoto has not been involved in any of the changes since then.   Thanks for reading my answer!

So its use is just like any currency - to make payments .  But how is it different from other currencies?  For that we might need to understand how a curreny works . So many many years ago traders accepted gold/precious metals etc in exchange for the services they provided . So a medium of exchange for services was gold (i.e. Money) .  But there was a problem .As they frequently travelled far across the states for business , keeping those heavy chunks of gold/metals etc was quite a tough task and posed problems (like carrying the gold,managing it etc) .  To solve the above problem , it was thought out that instead of carrying actual gold , traders would deposit their gold in a third party which they trusted and get from them a piece of paper declaring that the piece of paper was worth the amount of gold they had deposited (i.e. Currency) . So for the piece of paper to be of worth ,the parties involved in exchange needed to trust the third party (i.e. Bank). This was called the the \\u2018Gold Standard' where the piece of note actually meant that the same amount of gold was actually present in the bank and the parties could withdraw them from the bank using the paper .  So the value of the currency was the actual amount of gold inside the bank .Thats where the calue came from .  The Gold Standard was ended (meaning actual gold was not required) later and the currencies became fiat currency .Fiat currencies are the ones backed by the government of their resp countries and the value comes from the trust offered by the government .  The currencies however have a disadvantage that they can be regulated now and then by the Banks .eg. In India INR is regulated by RBI , similary for other currencies their resp countries central bank are responsible for the regulation .They can create new notes when and how they want (for various economic reasons).  Bitcoin is not regulated by any third party like bank , meaning it is decentralised(No third party has control over it) , Its a digital P2P - meaning Peer to Peer currency. This means every person in the world who has owned a bitcoin has a ledger (blockchain implementation) where he can verify the authenticity of every bitcoin and who were the owners previously(all transactions) . Digital meaning its created( or you say mining) by solving mathematical problems(basically hashes) on a computer that could consume electricity and more importantly time. There are a fixed no of bitcoins that can be mined (21 million) and already 16 million have been mined . But the process is such that the more you mine , the harder it is to mine the remaining .

It can be used to buy goods and services, hold value, and do many other things a currency typically does.  However, Bitcoin has no physical existence; it only has a digital existence. There are stark differences between bitcoin and other currencies. For instance, it lacks a central regulatory authority such as a central bank. Such radical issues initially made the currency get a lot of legal and political opposition in its first years of existence after it was introduced in 2009.  There are riveting benefits to this virtual currency such as greater transactional security, faster payments, and lower transaction costs have made its relevance in the modern financial world more apparent. This is why many countries now recognize the new-age currency and the groundbreaking technology on which it is based.  How does It Work?  There is a bit of confusion as to how bitcoin works. The process is quite simple.  First of all, you should have a bitcoin wallet installed on your computer or mobile device so that you can have a Bitcoin address. You are free to have all the addresses you want. Anyway, with this address, you can make payments and receive payments in form of bitcoin.  It is more like email, but you get and send payments, not messages. The wallets also have a private key, also called a seed. This private key is used to sign the transactions in order to verify them as having originated from that particular wallet.  Therefore, the transactions cannot be modified by anyone. These transactions are confirmed by computers in the network through a process called mining, and they are made part of the public ledger by being added to the blockchain.  The blockchain is a public ledger that details all the transactions that take place within the network. This system verifies all transactions independent of any single party, therefore ensuring security and transparency. This system is protected using cryptography.  Is It Legal?  The answer to this question can be yes, no or undefined; depending on the country or region you are talking about.  In some countries, Bitcoin exists in a legal gray area, where it is neither legal or illegal. In others, there are laws that clearly give cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin a legal standing, allowing its use for commerce within the country.  Whereas, in other countries, there are laws that clearly outlaw the use of this and other virtual currency. For instance, Bitcoin is legal in the USA and European Union as it is recognized as a currency. It is even subject to taxes that other currencies are subjected to when used in trade. The G7 has also given Bitcoin a legal status, although this comes with concerns that the currency may pose risks that regular currencies might not give their users.  At the same time, there are countries that have made laws that have made an absolute ban on the use of Bitcoin. Examples include Egypt, Bolivia, Saudi Arabia and others. In some countries, the ban is issued with regard to the use of this currency within the banking system, although it is legal for other financial situations.  These countries include Jordan, India, Thailand and others. In a country like Vietnam, it is legal to hold and trade in Bitcoin, but it is illegal to use it as a payment tool.  In other countries, Bitcoin is neither legal or illegal, and people use it without the risk of any legal consequences because there are no laws limiting or regulating its use. However, generally speaking, Bitcoin is legal in a majority of countries; and the number of countries that are lifting bans on its use continues to grow as the technology gains more acceptance in the mainstream financial world.  Who Runs It?  Nobody runs bitcoin; or more accurately, all its have a say in how it operates. This is different from the way regular currencies are operated. With regular currencies, value, inflation, supply and so forth is often dictated by a central authority.  Bitcoin, computers around the world work together to create bitcoins, with the ultimate number of coins that will constitute the bitcoin network set at 21 million. Its value is also determined by the laws of supply and demand.  How Can You Participate in It?  Being a bitcoin user or trader is very easy. You can join a broker that offers bitcoin trading, open an account and fund it with fiat currency and then use these funds to trade bitcoin. Similarly, you can open a bitcoin wallet, put money in it using regular currency and then use this currency to buy bitcoins and hold it in your wallet.  The other option is using a cryptocurrency exchange, which can give you bitcoins in exchange for regular currency. You can then withdraw this money into your cryptocurrency wallet, where bitcoin and other virtual currencies can be held and used to trade, make payments and do everything else that pertains to the use of a currency.  Can You Make Money with Bitcoin?  Yes, you can make money with Bitcoin, but this is highly subjective. If you know how to trade in currencies, then you can trade in bitcoin at various exchanges and make money as currency values around the world rise and fall.  You can also speculate on bitcoin's future value and buy or sell units of the currency with the hope of making a profit in future when the trend you expected happens.  However, just as with other financial assets, attempts to make a profit using Bitcoin come with risks of loss. So, make sure you know what you are doing as you try to make money through this virtual currency for you to actually turn a profit.  How Bitcoin (BTC), Cryptocurrency and Blockchain will Change Our Lives  The future of finance is believed to belong to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Banking institutions are already starting to embrace the blockchain technology on which these currencies are based as they offer a greater level of security during transactions. People will also take up the use of bitcoin more readily as it offers safer, faster, and a more globally accepted way of making and receiving payments in comparison to the traditional currencies.  As we speak, there are countries where residents are turning to bitcoin due to the instabilities the local currency offers due to political or economic issues facing them.  An example is Venezuela. This trend is likely to grow in future as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies exceed traditional currencies in acceptability around the world. Other sectors will change because of BTC and the blockchain technology as well. For instance, cloud storage services can use the encryption technology that blockchain systems use to ensure that data does not suffer any unauthorized modifications or access.  Even with regard to Internet of Things (IoT), bitcoin and its seminal blockchain technology has something to offer in future. Currently, this system works with a centralized technology, which is susceptible to hacks and other security issues. However, by being decentralized and encrypted like blockchain technology, it will be much safer for everybody.  So yes, bitcoin and blockchain technology will change the future in a big way.

And that is : If I hear the words Decentralized currency one more time, I am gonna personally find Satoshi Nakamoto and decentralize him.  Right, so let's see what Decentralized currency means later. For now, let's see what is Currency.  Currency is a tool which we use to exchange values. Earlier people were using Gold and other valuable metals to exchange with goods required by them. Gold was tangible. If a certain amount of Gold were to be in your hand, it basically meant you owned it.  Due to Gold's obvious disadvantages, we started using paper money. What we currently are acquainted with is something called Fiat Currency. Which means we are basically assuming that a particular piece of paper is worth some value.  *I promise to pay the bearer(of this note) the sum of one hundred rupees*  Nowadays most of the money is just in the form of numbers. So there is a possibility that the same money can be used for multiple transactions. This problem is called as Double Spending.  To avoid this, banks keep a ledger to keep track of all the transactions essentially acting as a Centre. Hence our conventional money is called as Centralized Currency.  Some computer scientists were not satisfied with a third party(bank) keeping track of transactions. This is when Satoshi Nakamoto comes in and proposes and entirely different solution where there is no 3rd party involved(decentralized currency). BITCOIN  Decentralized currency is like Internet. There is no one entity owning it(yet).  The deal with Bitcoin is that all the transactions are public and the ledger recording those transactions are public. This ledger is called as a BLOCKCHAIN. Everyone can have a copy of it and tally their transactions.  There might be issues regarding security but think of hacking a bitcoin blockchain as hacking english dictionary. You can change the meaning of a word in one dictionary. But not in every other copy in the world.  If you are still reading, I will add more content on it in future."}, {"upvote": 1158, "content": "Bitcoin is digital money that you can transfer to another person without the need of a third party, like a bank. It can be thought of as a digital equivalent of cash - it's just one person transferring value to another person, no bank involved. In fact, Bitcoins are not issued by a bank or government, so an even more apt analogy than cash might therefore be gold.  Ok, digital gold, got it. Weird. Why are people excited?  1. Get rid of transaction costs  UPDATE 2018\\u201301\\u201303: Bitcoin, due to various technical and political reasons, now has tremendously high transaction costs, several dollars per transaction. Bitcoins main competitor, Etherium [ https://www.ethereum.org/ ], is slightly better in this regard, but I'm personally banking on Stellar [ https://www.stellar.org/ ] which has very low transaction costs and is getting a lot of attention in recent months.  Because there is no central authority controlling the network, transactions costs are incredibly low compared to existing systems. Banks, card issuers and payment processors places a 1-5% transaction fee on that coffee you bought this morning, and everything else you buy. This is not very visible in everyday life, because it's almost always baked into the price of things, but if you start transferring money internationally with companies like Western Union, you realise that there is quite a bit of money in the business of transferring money.  2. Take currency power away from banks and government  Banks and government have the legal and physical ability to create money. I won't get into the details (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_creation) of how that works, but the main problem is that whenever money is created, it dilutes the value of everyone's money, which makes it a super-fast, completely silent, taxation.  Sometimes, governments and banks use this power responsibly, but sometimes, they do not. Lately, there has been a lot of the latter, with the Financial crisis of 2007\\u201308 [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late-2000s_financial_crisis ] caused by irresponsible lending, so a lot of people are starting to think that we probably are more reliant on banks and government that we want to be. An even more current example is Argentina, which has a 11% inflation (!) on its currency. Bitcoin is getting a strong hold there: BitPagos Uses Merchant Processing To Bring Bitcoin To Argentina [ http://thegenesisblock.com/bitpagos-uses-merchant-processing-bring-bitcoin-argentina/ ]  How does it work?  Before I go on, I'd like to point out that you probably don't know how your normal money works. Most people have no idea how money is transferred from one bank to another, or how it's created in the first place.  With that said, all Bitcoin transactions, from the beginning of time, are written down in an enormous, public ledger. When you transfer money from your Bitcoin wallet to another person, you do that by writing this transaction down in the public ledger. Everyone is watching this ledger and has their own copies of it, and so they now know that there is less money in your wallet, and more money in a friend's wallet. So everyone knows how much money each wallet contains. This is where your money is stored, in this public ledger with millions of copies that everyone maintains together. They do, however, not know who owns that wallet - Bitcoin has no notion of identity.  So what's preventing another person from transferring money from my wallet to their own?  This is where cryptography comes in. When your Bitcoin wallet is generated, it's given to you in two parts. One public part, an address, that you give to other people so that they know where to send you money, and a secret part, a key.  The key is used to \\\"sign\\\" transactions. It takes the amount, the sender address, receiver address, and the key, jumbles it together with math, and out comes a signature, that you put in the ledger along with the transactions. Due to how cryptography works, other people can mathematically verify that the person that generated this signature for this transaction must indeed have the key for this wallet. They can, however, not work backwards to what the key actually is - that would take a supercomputer thousands of years to do.

The Bitcoin story starts in 2008 with an anonymous founder called Satoshi Nakamoto. During this time, Nakamoto shared a post titled, Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper.

Published as an open-source program in 2009, Bitcoin is frequently credited as the world's earliest cryptocurrency and can be best defined as an electronic money which just exists electronically.  Bitcoin is decentralized, meaning it does not possess a central issuing authority or governmental association that controls the quantity of bitcoin in circulation. However, the Bitcoin system is far from anarchy.  The procedure is coordinated and straightforward: Bitcoin holders can move bitcoins by means of a network. This ledger records each trade. Each\\\"block\\\" from the blockchain consists of a data structure according to encrypted Merkle Trees. This is very helpful for discovering fraud or corrupted files. The blockchain keeps it if a file in a series is corrupt or deceptive.  Rather than relying upon a government to publish new money, Bitcoin's blockchain programming manages when bitcoins are created and how many are created. Additionally, it keeps tabs on where bitcoins guarantees that the transactions are true and are.  There is not authorities controlling the source of bitcoins or a fundamental agency. The supply is capped at 21 million bitcoins.  This cap increases a debate that Bitcoin might have problems climbing. But as Bitcoin is basically infinitesimally divisible (meaning consumers may move as few as 0.00000001 bitcoins), this does not really produce a scaling problem. 21 million's amount is random.  It is considered that Bitcoin was developed to develop into a money because a tax earned riches, to fight the government's usage of inflation. Men and women praise Bitcoin for enabling people by overthrowing the money printing abilities of politicians.  The mining procedures have become increasingly complex. ASICS are hardware systems very similar to CPU computers that are constructed for the only reason of mining bitcoins.  Bitcoin mining operations require a good deal of power and work, along with the quantity of competition makes it hard for newcomers to join gain and the race.

Bitcoin, often described as a cryptocurrency, a virtual currency or a digital currency - is a type of money that is completely virtual.  It's like an online version of cash. You can use it to buy products and services, but not many shops accept Bitcoin yet and some countries have banned it altogether.  However, some companies are beginning to buy into its growing influence.  For example, the online payment service, PayPal, announced that it would be allowing its customers to buy and sell Bitcoin.  The physical Bitcoins you see in photos are a novelty. They would be worthless without the private codes printed inside them.  How does Bitcoin work?  Each Bitcoin is basically a computer file which is stored in a 'digital wallet' app on a smartphone or computer.  People can send Bitcoins (or part of one) to your digital wallet, and you can send Bitcoins to other people.  Every single transaction is recorded in a public list called the blockchain.  This makes it possible to trace the history of Bitcoins to stop people from spending coins they do not own, making copies or undo-ing transactions.  How do people get Bitcoins?  There are three main ways people get Bitcoins.   * You can buy Bitcoins using 'real' money.  * You can sell things and let people pay you with Bitcoins.  * Or they can be created using a computer.

Trust me, you won't care about the price fluctuation anymore. Thank me Later.  Note: This is not in any case of me trying to lure you into anything for my own personal financial gain, i am just innocently sharing with you what works for me. You can also make a research on what works for you too.  With all that preamble over, let's dive into the steps involved in a smart bitcoin investment.  Step 1: Choose a Crypto Exchange or Platform  Your first step of course will be to choose where to buy your crypto.  Like USD, bitcoin is the same no matter where you withdraw it from. Therefore, your primary considerations will be safety, convenience and fees.  We've published a whole story on the best crypto exchanges, but to help narrow your search, here are my top three picks for beginners.  For Most Beginners: Coinbase   * Pros: Extremely user-friendly; a publicly traded company; earn free crypto with Coinbase Learn.  * Cons: High trading fees; can't control wallet keys. Coinbase is a household name for crypto buying for a reason. It's not only the first crypto exchange to go public; it's also the softest landing pad for crypto beginners.  Coinbase knows that crypto investing can be a little intimidating, so it designed its buying process to be as streamlined as possible. You pretty much just sign up, attach a payment method and \\u2014 boom \\u2014 buy crypto like it's Amazon.  Plus you can earn free crypto by watching short training videos on Coinbase Learn.  Coinbase's Learn and Earn  The chief drawback to Coinbase is that it charges higher-than-average fees: up to $2.99 per transaction plus a spread fee of around 0.50% between purchase and sale prices.  But due to convenience, safety and customer service, many traders stick with Coinbase for the long haul.  Step 2: Connect Your Bank Account to the Exchange  Step 2 is pretty straightforward \\u2014 at some point, your chosen crypto exchange is going to ask you to connect a bank account as your primary payment method. Hand 'em your bank account and routing numbers and you're good to go.  As simple as it is, Step 2 does raise a common question:  Can I Buy Crypto With a Credit Card?  In most cases, no. In fact, Coinbase, like most crypto exchanges, won't even let you add a credit card.  Here's why: Most banks treat crypto purchases like cash advances. Therefore, your bank will immediately charge you a cash-advance fee of 3% to 5% of the purchase amount. It also won't give you a grace period, meaning you'll accumulate high interest on your crypto purchase immediately. Heck, if the exchange isn't U.S. based, it'll even charge you a foreign transaction fee on top of everything else, just for good measure.  But banks don't mind wiring the money from your bank account to the exchange. The reason is simple: That's your money, not theirs.  So if you were hoping that your bitcoin investment would earn you some rewards points on the side, sorry to burst your bubble.  Step 3: Place an Order  Now that you've registered for an account and attached your bank account, it's finally time to buy some bitcoin!  On most exchanges, you're never more than a click or two away from buying bitcoin. Click the big Buy/Sell button and you'll be brought to a page like this one from Coinbase:  Coinbase's Buy Window  Next question: How much should you buy?  Well, this article is more of a how to than a how much. But since we're here, I will say this to help you come up with an initial purchase amount:  1. Re-familiarize yourself with the Before Investing section above. 2. Determine your risk tolerance. 3. Speak to your wealth advisor (or consider getting one) to determine how much of your portfolio you should dedicate to very-high-risk investments. 4. Start small \\u2014 Put in a small fraction of a paycheck and watch how it performs over time. 5. Finally, don't worry about purchasing round numbers (like 1 BTC for $50,000) since exchanges support partial coins. If you're getting cold feet, remember that you can always earn free crypto, risk free, through Coinbase Learn or from bitcoin mining."}, {"upvote": 233, "content": "Learning how to invest in bitcoin usually involves getting set up with a digital wallet and then signing up for a cryptocurrency exchange or broker that allows trading of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.

Most bitcoin investors hold onto the cryptocurrency for a while, but if you think the price will decline soon, you might want to sell some of your bitcoin. The easiest way to sell bitcoin is to cash it out on the exchange or broker you used to buy it.  As with all assets, there are some risks of investing in bitcoin. Volatility is the biggest risk of investing in bitcoin because the price can change quite rapidly with no warning.  Choose Where to Buy Bitcoin  Let's start with where and how to buy bitcoin. Learning how to invest in bitcoin starts with setting up an account on a cryptocurrency exchange or broker that offers crypto trading. You also need a digital wallet to hold the bitcoin after you buy it.  Some of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges are:  Coinbase (COIN [ https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COIN?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link ])  With Coinbase, you don't necessarily need a digital wallet because the company will store your bitcoin for free. However, you might still want a separate digital wallet because the cryptocurrency will be secure if hackers ever break into Coinbase. The exchange charges a base rate of 4% before waivers, which means the actual rate paid is less. The company waives part of the transaction fee based on what payment method you use. For example, Coinbase charges a 1.49% rate on bank account and Coinbase USD wallet conversions after the waiver. The company charges 3.99% on debit card or PayPal conversions and up to 1.5% on instant card withdrawals, with a minimum fee of 55 cents. The exchange is a good choice for beginners because the interface is simple, and there are limited transaction types.  Binance.US | Buy & Sell Crypto [ http://Binance.US ]  Binance is harder to use than Coinbase, and there is a steep learning curve with it. Binance's platform is user-friendly and offers three levels organized by trading experience, although it is still more difficult to use than Coinbase. Binance lacks a built-in digital wallet as well. The exchange charges 3% to 4.5% for debit or credit card transactions, although ACH transfers are free. Wire transfers are $15, while purchases are 0.02% to 0.1%. Trades are charged at the same rate. There is also an instant buy and sell fee of 0.5%.  Gemini  This crypto exchange offers site insurance to protect users' digital assets against hacks on the exchange. Gemini [ https://www.gemini.com/ ] offers products for both beginner and advanced cryptocurrency investors. There's a simple interface for new investors, while its ActiveTrader platform is designed for advanced investors. Gemini is more expensive than other crypto exchanges, but its fees cover insurance and more features. The company charges trading and transaction fees of up to 1.49%, depending on the trading platform, 3.49% for debit card purchases, and other fees. Gemini also offers a digital wallet. For users of the exchange's website and mobile app, it charges a flat 0.5% \\\"convenience fee\\\" on trading and transactions. In addition, it charges a flat fee ranging from 99 cents to $2.99 for transactions up to $200 and 1.49% of the order value for those higher than $200.  Coinmama  This exchange supports fewer cryptocurrencies than the other exchanges on this list and has higher fees. Coinmama [ https://www.coinmama.com/?locale=en ] offers a variety of payment options, including using Visa or Mastercard for transactions. The exchange differs from other exchanges because it doesn't facilitate crypto transactions between two other parties. Instead, it sells bitcoin from its own inventory. Additionally, the company doesn't provide a digital wallet. Coinmama requires a $50 minimum to buy cryptocurrency and a $200 minimum to sell. Trading fees amount to the market rate plus 2% to buy and the market rate plus up to 0.9% to sell. Transaction fees are up to 3.9% on purchases, plus 5% for credit and debit card transactions.  Some traditional brokers also offer cryptocurrency trading, including:  Robinhood  Robinhood is an online brokerage, and it offers bitcoin transactions in a way that brokers offer stock trades. In other words, you can enter different order types for your bitcoin trades, just as you do with stocks. For example, market orders are executed immediately, although Robinhood limits orders so that bitcoin won't sell if the price falls more than 5% than what it was at the time you placed your market sell order or increases more than 1% from when you placed to buy order. This helps protect against volatility, which crypto exchanges do not. Unfortunately, you can't withdraw bitcoin from Robinhood, which you can do with exchanges, although you can sell bitcoin at Robinhood. The company doesn't charge any commission on transactions, instead making money through a pay-order-flow fee that varies according to trade. Robinhood also supports margin trading, which means you can borrow money to buy bitcoin. It charges interest on accounts that trade on margin.  eToro  eToro is also an online brokerage, so it offers charts and analysis tools similar to those it offers for stock trading on its platform.

Word of warning: You should have some basic knowledge of Bitcoin to ensure you're doing the transaction smoothly, safely, and securely.  Question:   * Why do people buy/sell bitcoins in cash? Well, there are many reasons. One reason is that buying in cash from P2P marketplaces gives you more anonymity.  When you buy bitcoins from an exchange or a popular Bitcoin site, you hand over your personal details to complete the business's KYC (know your customer).  This takes away the anonymous nature of Bitcoin transactions (which is one of the core reasons for Bitcoin's existence). But when you buy from an independent seller, your transaction is 99% more anonymous than buying from other sites.  P2P Marketplaces for Bitcoins  In this tutorial, you will learn about P2P sites which are like eBay for Bitcoin.  These sites connect independent buyers & sellers, and they use the P2P platform to do the transaction.  The downside is that you need to ensure the safety & security of the transaction on your own.  Here are a few important tips to keep yourself secure when dealing with bitcoins for cash:   * Make sure you buy bitcoins from a seller with high reputation (more on this later).  * Meet the seller at a public place in broad daylight.  * Do not exchange unrequired personal details when you meet with the seller.  * Wait for the transaction to confirm at least twice. I usually wait for 3-4 confirmations. Sometimes it takes about 5-15 minutes for the transaction to confirm multiple times.

As a starting point, it's important to remember that the same intuitive rules that apply to traditional money also applies to Bitcoin. For example, don't store cash under your mattress else it might get stolen, or don't trust your money with strangers.  Bitcoin also has some fairly unique risks: for one, it's a brand new technology, and while it appears very secure and robust, there is always a chance that it might fail. That is also a reason why you should never put \\u2018all your eggs in one basket' and never buy more Bitcoin than you can afford to lose. Bitcoin is also more volatile (i.e. it can move a lot in value both up or down in a short space of time) than many other currencies, and while this appears to be stabilising over time, it's sure to experience many highly volatile moments in the future.  With the startup cryptocurrency investment company like cryptosbinary Investment Limited (www.cryptosbinary, com) where you get 40%ROI of your invested cryptocurrency after 7 days. To help simplify this tedious process, we made a breakdown of some of the most promising cryptocurrency tokens/coins that are most likely to birth highly attractive profits for both traders and investors.  Also remember that Bitcoin transactions are like cash in that they are irreversible - so if you send Bitcoin to the wrong person, or your Bitcoin wallet is compromised and someone steals your Bitcoin, it might be very difficult if not impossible to get it back. Bitcoin is also not backed by any entity, so if you lose your Bitcoin, your service provider or \\u2018the Bitcoin network' will not be able to reimburse your funds. That's why you need to ensure you use highly trusted product or service providers to help you, similar to how you would ask a bank to help you safely store your money.  Lastly, Bitcoin's value is determined by the amount of people or business that are willing to accept it, and this is by no means guaranteed. If it grows it will be very good for Bitcoin, but if less people want to use Bitcoin, it will have a very negative impact on the price and might lead to Bitcoin not being used at all.  To summarise, Bitcoin is very exciting and has tremendous potential to change the world, but make sure you understand the risks that go hand in hand with that."}, {"upvote": 261, "content": "After more than one full year of an uptrend, the volatile crypto market wiped out months of progress in days. The sharp reversal caused a 50% drop across the board, and it was enough to spook the market.

If bears can close the monthly RSI back below overbought levels, then the bull market could be over according to scenario B from 2017. Scenario A, however, shows bull holding the key level, and making another drastic push higher to finish the bull market.  In scenario A, the stock-to-flow model should be proven accurate, and the leading cryptocurrency by market cap will head towards hundreds of thousands of dollars per coin.  But what if the stock-to-flow model, and every major analyst that's glanced at a Bitcoin chart is dead wrong about expectations, or something catastrophic happens? It sounds unrealistic, but nothing is guaranteed in markets \\u2013 not even the success of Bitcoin.  Droves of analysts have produced charts that demonstrate what that path to hundreds of thousands looks like, but what might a devastating collapse look like instead?  If a bear market takes place now and with the stock-to-flow model causing expectations to be so high, the short investment horizon of impatient investors could lead to a sharper selloff if BTC isn't trading at hundreds of thousands before the year's end.

While gold was the default store of value for millennia, I don't think Bitcoin can keep its position as the default crypto for long.  Bitcoin's technology is ageing and replicable, its value lies in its brand - the fact that many institutional investors have accepted it, the fact that people talk about it, the fact that it's the default digital alternative to gold.

To make or understand a Bitcoin price prediction, you must first know how Bitcoin fluctuates.  Just like most currencies, the price of Bitcoin changes every day. The only difference is that the price of Bitcoin changes on a much greater scale than local currencies.  Bitcoin's price has crashed many times over the years:   * In 2011, the price crashed 93% in five months;  * From November 2014 to January 2015, Bitcoin's value was halved, much like its crash in December 2017. Will Bitcoin Crash Again?  If more countries create regulations/laws for cryptocurrency, more bad news will be published. This means we may see Bitcoin crashing again.

This could take a long time. 2. It might not affect the price of Bitcoin. Until then, the most popular Bitcoin projection is that it will continue to rise.

If more people start wanting to sell their Bitcoin on the spot market, then the supply on the spot market increases. The price will naturally fall.

What makes Bitcoin different, however, is that investors can choose to take their Bitcoin out of the spot market by putting it in cold storage. This way, the price of Bitcoin at any given time is the same as the price on the spot market.  For example, Bitcoin reserves are currently at their lowest on the exchange platforms and therefore on the spot market, but since there is not enough demand on the spot market, the price continues to fall.  This does not mean that investors are losing confidence. It means that those who are still in the spot market are selling their last units of BTC at a discount to those who believe in the future of Bitcoin.

The price of the world's largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC 2.98 percent), had fallen 3.4 percent in the previous 24 hours as of 1:25 p.m. ET. The world's second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH 1.56 percent), was down about 4%, and meme token Dogecoin (DOGE 0.28 percent) was down more than 5%. The stock market was also down, with the broad S&amp;P 500 index down about 3.5 percent. The price of Bitcoin has also affected cryptos with large ecosystems like World Mobile Token which uses proof of stake to connect people round the world and Solana which has a large ecosystem.  Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies, like many other relatively risky assets such as tech and growth stocks, have performed poorly recently as interest rates have risen and are expected to rise further. The Federal Reserve has already raised its overnight lending rate, known as the federal funds rate, several times as part of a fiscal tightening program aimed at bringing inflation back under control. The federal funds rate is now between 0.75 and 1 percent, and the price of Bitcoin is down nearly 39 percent this year.  The Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the prices of a market basket of goods and services, rose 8.3 percent year on year in April, according to data released earlier this month. While this is still unusually high, it was lower than the 8.5 percent year-over-year increase in March, indicating that inflation may be slowing. However, comments made by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday appear to have alarmed investors. He basically stated that the Fed will continue to raise interest rates until inflation stabilizes.  \\\"If that means going beyond broadly understood levels of neutral, we won't hesitate,\\\" Powell told The Wall Street Journal. \\\"We'll go until we feel we've arrived at a point where we can say financial conditions are appropriate, and we see inflation coming down.\\\"  Assuming that conditions do not change significantly, most investors anticipate that the Federal Open Market Committee will raise interest rates by 50 basis points (0.5 percentage points) after its June and July meetings.  When the federal funds rate rises, the yield on safer assets such as US Treasury bills rises, making riskier assets less appealing. Rising interest rates raise the cost of doing business, which can reduce corporate earnings \\u2013 not that cryptocurrencies are businesses that generate earnings.  In other news, several prominent figures have recently made negative public statements about Bitcoin's future. Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke stated earlier this week in a CNBC interview that he does not expect consumers to make ordinary, everyday purchases with Bitcoin because it would be \\\"too expensive and inconvenient to do so.\\\"  Earlier this week, Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO and co-founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, told the Financial Times that he does not believe Bitcoin has a future as a payment network.  In his opinion, Bitcoin will be unable to scale sufficiently to meet demand, owing to its proof-of-work mining process, which requires massive amounts of computing power and consumes a colossal amount of electricity. Many other cryptocurrencies have abandoned proof-of-work protocols because they are harmful to the environment, but Bitcoin is unlikely to do so anytime soon."}, {"upvote": 5, "content": "Faith.

The more people who want to buy or sell at any given time, the higher its price will go. If there aren't enough buyers at a certain price level, sellers might lower their asking prices to unload coins quicker. Bitcoin was the first type of cryptocurrency created in 2009 by an unknown programmer named Satoshi Nakamoto. As opposed to traditional currencies such as the U.S. dollar or euro, bitcoin doesn't have a centralized governing body such as a country's central bank regulating it. Bitcoins are created as payments for validating transactions for those using other forms of cryptocurrency.  Investing in cryptocurrency  The process of investing in cryptocurrency can be overwhelming at first, but it's not too hard to get started. You'll need to start by setting up an account on Coinbase. Once you have a Coinbase account, you can transfer funds from your bank account and buy bitcoin (BTC). Next, send the bitcoin to your personal wallet (e.g. myetherwallet) and store it there until you're ready to use it for investment purposes or trade with another party.  1. Register on Coinbase  2. Transfer funds  3. Buy BTC  4. Send BTC to personal wallet  5. Keep funds stored in personal wallet  6. Trade BTC 7. When you want to trade bitcoin, log back into Coinbase  8. Select Accounts and then Send  9. Select Bitcoin  10. Enter the recipient address  11. Enter the amount  12. Verify everything is correct  13. Select Pay  14. Review  15. A confirmation email will be sent to both parties 16. After about one hour, the bitcoin will show as confirmed in both wallets . At this point, the sender has successfully transferred ownership of their bitcoin to the receiver. Now that you know how to purchase Bitcoin, let's talk about how to invest with them! To invest in cryptocurrencies, you'll need a digital wallet and some spare cash. I recommend buying some Ethereum and keeping it secure in your digital wallet until there are good investment opportunities (e.g., when prices are low). If you have any questions about anything we've discussed here please feel free to contact us!  Earning free cryptocurrency  Bitcoin is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in use, and it allows you to earn cryptocurrency without investing in it. The easiest way to do so is by joining an online service called CoinPot. CoinPot includes over 40 different coins, including Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), and Dogecoin (DOGE). All you have to do is sign up for an account with them, and then they will give you 10% of whatever coins you mine! That means that if you mine 100 DOGE, CoinPot will credit your account with 10 DOGE. It's as easy as that! Another option would be to invest in bitcoin mining equipment such as ASIC miners or cloud mining contracts through companies like Hashflare or Genesis Mining. These provide more than just bitcoins; many also produce other altcoins like Ethereum, Dash, Monero and Zcash. There are three ways to mine Bitcoin. First is solo mining which entails using computer resources and applying brute force to find Bitcoins on its own \\u2013 this can take a long time to generate any significant income. Second is pool mining which means working together with others in a pool where the reward can vary depending on how much work has been done by each miner but on average generates around 1 BTC per month - however there are hidden costs associated with running hardware 24/7 which may not make it profitable.  Trading cryptocurrency for profit  The easiest way to trade cryptocurrency is through an online exchange, such as Coinbase. Once you have opened your account and connected it to your bank account, you can start buying and selling currencies. It's important to note that the price of Bitcoin will fluctuate constantly, so don't go in with all of your savings! If you want to trade cryptocurrency for profit, make sure you are constantly monitoring the market for opportunities. For example, if you notice that one currency has been dropping steadily over a few days but another has been slowly rising then this could be a good opportunity to buy into the latter currency. You may not get rich quick with this method, but if done right it can lead to some decent profits over time.  Check Out How To Get Rich With Bitcoin Even If You Have No Clue About Technology.

Once a transaction is confirmed on the Blockchain, there is no way to reverse it.  Beware of Bitcoin recovery scams  There are many Bitcoin recovery services that claim to be able to return stolen Bitcoin. They will have all kinds of explanations of how they do this.  Here is a debunking of the most common recovery methods:  Lawyers:  What they promise: we will prosecute thieves and force them to return stolen Bitcoin  Why it won't work:  In almost all cases, you won't know the identity of the people who stole your Bitcoin. It's nearly impossible to find out the real-world identity of the owner of a given Bitcoin address.  Even if you have a name, email address, registered trading account, website, etc, it will be very difficult to obtain the cooperation of the police in getting their real-world identity.  The police don't care about small-scale theft. In most cases, the thieves will be in a different country than you. Furthermore, unlike cash, there is no paper trail to follow. Bitcoin/cryptocurrency is generally considered property rather than money, and hacking isn't given the same weight as theft of physical goods. All of this makes authorities unlikely to pursue cases.  He's lying. Binance does not have bank accounts all over, and they have never returned a deposit of scammed funds.  Even when the identity of the thieves is definitely known, the Bitcoin is rarely returned. The only cases where Bitcoin has been recovered in theft has been in a class-action lawsuit (such as with Mt Gox). Even then, it usually takes thousands of victims, at least tens of millions of dollars stolen, expensive attorneys, and many years.  I'm not saying it's impossible. Just don't expect to send a random lawyer $5000-$10,000 (typical recovery fees) and anything useful to happen. It's a scam.  Ethical hackers  What they promise: we will hack the thieves and get them to return your Bitcoin.  Why it won't work:  First, anyone who was able to steal your money is already a sophisticated hacker. Most hackers prey on the technologically ignorant. Anyone capable of stealing your Bitcoin probably knows the tricks of so-called ethical hackers.  Second, it's nearly impossible to find out the real-world identity from a Bitcoin address or an email address. If the U.S. government struggles to find find out who operates darknet markets, what hope has some hacker you paid $1000?  Third, even an ethical hacker has to break into someone else's systems \\u2014 and probably break some laws in the process. If they could someone break into people's computers to get their Bitcoin, why should they return it to you? Why do they need you at all? If they can hack people's computers to steal Bitcoin, they are just as likely to steal yours.  There are no credible, independent reports of anyone successfully doing this. Ethical hackers that return Bitcoin for cash upfront simply do not exist. It's a scam.  Blockchain hackers  What they promise: we will hack Bitcoin or brute force your private key to reverse the transaction and return your Bitcoin.  Why it won't work:  The market cap of Bitcoin is nearly $700 billion dollars. Every single Bitcoin transaction and address is public. If someone could steal or reverse a Bitcoin transaction, they wouldn't be helping you. They would be going after the richest Bitcoin wallets worth tens of billions of dollars. [ https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin/rich-list/ ] Of course, once it got out that Bitcoin could be hacked, the exploit would either be patched, or Bitcoin would become worthless.  No matter how brilliant they claim to be, it's a scam.  Chainalysis  What they claim: we will trace Bitcoin transaction to the service holding them, and force them to return your money.  Why it won't work:  Chainalysis is a real thing. There are companies [ https://www.chainalysis.com/ ] that keep databases of addresses used by criminals and gambling sites, and help exchanges ban those customers. Unfortunately, they can't help you for a few reasons:  First, they have expensive products for businesses and governments than the random recovery service you found online probably doesn't have access to.  Second, the most they can do is trace which major exchange or business got your Bitcoin. At this point, you would need the cooperation of the exchange to tell you which customer made that deposit. That cooperation is impossible to obtain without a court order, which as previously explained is nearly impossible to obtain. Furthermore, thieves don't use cooperative exchanges in the first place, since they require KYC.  [ https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Know_your_customer ]If they want to cash out, they are going to use some less-reputable service in a country that probably does not cooperate with your government.  Third, once your crypto hits an exchange, it's impossible to trace what a given customer does with it next. If someone simply deposits Bitcoin with an exchange, you will never know when they take it out or move it. This is because exchanges combine all their funds, so your stolen Bitcoin will be given to whoever requests a withdrawal first. It will not be withdrawn by the person who deposited it.  Fourth, criminals don't keep Bitcoin at exchanges. In my experience, they will either sit on it for years or cash it out immediately. They are not stupid enough to keep it where it can be confiscated, however unlikely that is.  It's a scam.  Conclusion:  It is nearly impossible to return your stolen cryptocurrency.
