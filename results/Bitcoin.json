Bitcoin is anti-technology if anything. It\\u2019s the first of its kind, slower than any of the other coins that came after it, and isn\\u2019t anywhere near as flashy in its ability to do anything. There are no claims. It simply is. Whereas technology companies frequently tell you that they will change the world only to fall on their face when they are told to turn a profit. Not only is it not a comparison, but it is revealing insight into the knowledge of an author\\u2014or lack thereof.\\n\\nYou can instantly tell who doesn\\u2019t know anything they\\u2019re talking about.\\n\\nBitcoin has been an investable asset because society does not know what or how to value; when society does know what to value, they tend to experience the loss of all of those years in not valuing the asset\\u2014in other words, the price of the asset begins to skyrocket over smaller increments of time.\\n\\nBitcoin has been valuable since its inception. For those in the Slush Pool in 2011 like myself, we were experimenting in something that was the first of its kind. A lot of us transacted in bitcoin because it was far more convenient and far more privacy-focused than anything else on the market.\\n\\nHere is what inflated \\u201ctechnology\\u201d stocks that sell advertisement space on their platforms can do:\\n\\n1. Dilute shareholders by selling additional stock at the peak (even if they haven\\u2019t made a profit yet). I\\u2019m looking at Draft Kings, Shopify, and all the rest that have executives which pay themselves by creating additional shares and posting them out into markets. Bitcoin can\\u2019t do that. Why? Only so many exist, you know how it is mined, there is an exact general ledger of what it is and what is happening. Nothing is a secret. There are no forms. The SEC won\\u2019t be late to penalize someone for scamming. It is exactly what it is and will always be the same. No matter what.\\n2. Bitcoin is a database created by everyone. In many ways, it is the most elegant form of currency. It is trustless, yet people work together without actually consenting to working together or requiring someone else to do the right things. They are incentivized to do the right things.\\n3. Bitcoin is weightless. Go take pounds of gold somewhere to transact.\\n4. The price of an asset is the price that buyers are willing to pay for it. This is mathematics, but obviously grade school fails people here and there. It is a number that can be manipulated, but bitcoin is being adopted across the board.\\n5. It\\u2019s a hedge against politicians and the federal reserve who can\\u2019t be trusted. Every currency across history has failed. Nations make terrible choices and print more than the society can pay for later. We have printed over $5 trillion in dollars in 2020. The fed is telling you that things are going to be okay, but even they don\\u2019t know what the hell they\\u2019re doing. 0% rates, printing money against your income, and pumping the stock market.

Or are they going to crash and burn?\\n\\nInstead of telling you to invest in it or not, what I\\u2019m going to do is outline some facts about bitcoin as an investment and tell you about what happened with bubbles in the past. And then you can decide.\\n\\nFlashback no. 1\\n\\nThe Dot com bubble, 2000\\n\\nFueled by the rise of companies with a \\u201c.com\\u201d after their name, the \\u201c.com\\u201d bubble saw the price of the NASDAQ jump from 1000 to 5000 over 5 years. This was a 500% increase and was fueled by purely speculative investments.\\n\\nFundamentals were thrown away. People were rushing to buy any internet based company, ignoring the fact that these companies wouldn\\u2019t be making any money for the next few years. Money was cheap. Funding was easy. A bubble was formed.\\n\\nAnd like all bubbles, it burst in 2001. Companies that had a market capitalization of hundreds of millions were now worth 0. The stock market rapidly declined. Trillions of dollars of investors money was lost.\\n\\nFlashback no. 2\\n\\nThe housing bubble, 2006/2007\\n\\nAfter the recession the \\u201c.com\\u201d bubble caused, interest rates started to drop. Investors abandoned the stock market and turned to real estate. Lending requirements all but vanished. Housing prices started to go up. Speculators entered the market and made tens of thousands of dollars in weeks. A bubble was formed.\\n\\nAnd like all bubbles, it burst in 2007/2008 with the collapse of Lehmann Brothers, causing the largest recession in history since World War II. Millions of dollars were lost. Homes were destroyed. It took the economy years to recover.\\n\\nWhat is the definition of a \\u201cbubble\\u201d in finance?\\n\\nA \\u201cbubble\\u201d occurs when the price of a stock or investment is driven up to unsustainably high levels, substantially way more than what that item is worth. This bubble is usually caused by emotions of the masses, and not by logical investing or \\u201clooking at fundamentals\\u201d. And it always starts off as something that made sense in the beginning.\\n\\nIts exactly the same with Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin has jumped 18,749,900% since 2010. It made sense to invest in it a few years ago. It was secure, unregulated and cryptocurrency seems like the future. But does it make sense to invest in it now?\\n\\nYes, Bitcoin has its pros. It\\u2019s unregulated. Decentralized. Operates on Blockchain technology. But it\\u2019s also unregulated(see what I did there?). Has no intrinsic value. And it\\u2019s highly volatile.\\n\\nLook, I might even be wrong. There are people that have forecasted the price of Bitcoin to hit 100,000$ a coin in ten years.\\n\\nBut I\\u2019m going to stay out of it. Warren Buffett has warned against it. Jamie Dimon has warned against it. Alan Greenspan compared it to gambling in Las Vegas.\\n\\nIf you must invest in it, remember the golden rule of investing - Never invest more than what you\\u2019re willing to lose. If you absolutely must, no more than 10% of your portfolio must be invested in risky assets.\\n\\nLike the famous economist Paul Samuelson once said, \\u201cInvesting should be like watching paint dry and watching grass grow. If you want excitement, take 100$ and go to Vegas\\u201d.\\n\\nEDIT: I seem to have gotten a lot of backlash for this answer. Guys, I understand were you all are coming from and I agree, 100%. Blockchain IS revolutionary. Cryptos are well designed to be the future of payments, and Blockchain is definitely not going away. But, this itself is not a reason to buy Bitcoin!\\n\\nThis has happened in the past as well with Airline industries and tech industries. Yes, some of them have done well, exceedingly well. But that\\u2019s because they were good companies, with solid fundamentals and a good management team! It has nothing to do with the fact that they were \\u201cthe future\\u201d.\\n\\nThis answer is ONLY about whether you should make an investment in Bitcoin or not. Blockchain is an exceedingly innovative and futuristic technology, no doubt about that.\\n\\nI\\u2019m going to end this with a quote from Benjamin Graham, widely regarded as one of the best Investors of our time. \\u201cObvious prospects for physical growth in an industry do not translate into obvious prospects for investors\\u201d.\\n\\nEDIT 2: For all the haters in the comments:\\n\\nThis answer was first drafted when Bitcoin was at 14,000 USD a coin.

They were called altcoins, as alternatives to Bitcoin.\\n\\nThough the FBI shut down the Silk Road in 2013, it showcased the promise of Bitcoin as a digital payment method.\\n\\nIn March 2014, Mt.Gox went bankrupt following a massive hack.\\n\\nDespite the closure of the Silk Road and the collapse of Mt. Gox the crypto space kept expanding.\\n\\nNow there are a lot of pro-crypto people and yet companies accepting Bitcoins, who believe that BTC can alter a global economy with digital money, changing it for the better.\\n\\n\\nHow does Bitcoin work?\\n\\nSince Bitcoin is decentralized, volunteers who are called \\\"miners\\\" constantly verify and update the blockchain. As soon as a specific amount of transactions are verified, another block is added to the blockchain.\\n\\nBTC's system rewards successful miners with bitcoins. The reward changes over time, halving about every four years. The current reward for a new block of verified transactions is 6.25 BTC. By reducing the rewards of mining bitcoin, halving ensures that the amount of bitcoin in circulation does not increase exponentially, which also tends to put upward pressure on its price.\\n\\nThe algorithm works like this: you create a transaction =%3E it is added to the network and sent to miners =%3E they confirm it =%3E your funds have successfully been sent.\\n\\nIs Bitcoin Legal?\\n\\nBitcoin ownership and mining are legal in more countries than not. Some examples of places where it is illegal are Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Bolivia, Ecuador, Nepal, and Pakistan.\\ufeff Overall, Bitcoin use and mining are legal across much of the globe.\\n\\n\\nHow did it appear?\\n\\nSince the code for Bitcoin may have been written in 2007, the first known sign of it came out in August 2008, when the domain name for \\\"http://bitcoin.org [ http://bitcoin.org/ ]\\\" was registered.\\n\\nBitcoin was introduced to the world by a person under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in October 2008 when he posted a paper  [ https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf ]titled \\\"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\\\" to the cryptography mailing list. The Bitcoin white paper is not only considered the most seminal piece of work in the cryptocurrency movement, it also gave birth to a transformative technology called blockchain.\\n\\n\\ud83d\\udc46 It is interesting to know that he has never intended to invent a currency. In his announcement of Bitcoin in late 2008, Satoshi said that he developed \\\"A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\\\" only.\\n\\nOn 3rd Jan 2009, he mined the first block called \\\"Genesis\\\" with the text: \\\"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\\\"\\n\\nIt refers to a headline in The Times newspaper from the same date. It's possible that Nakamoto just picked the first headline he saw in the nearest paper. However, crypto enthusiasts tend to agree it's a statement of intent. The financial crisis of 2008 was still unraveling, and it's assumed that Bitcoin was a reaction to the widespread anger and frustration at the current financial system.\\n\\n9th Jan 2009, Nakamoto announced Bitcoin version 0.1 in his \\\"White Paper\\\" to the cryptography mailing list.\\n\\n12th Jan 2009: Nakamoto does the first Bitcoin transaction to Hal Finney, who was heavily involved in the community, advocating for the use of cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies.\\n\\nIn 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto officially stopped communicating. Between this period, the Bitcoins existing on the blockchain ledger, have not been used or spent. It proves how much Satoshi owns.\\n\\nHaving disappeared, Satoshi officially decentralized the network for good. Nakamoto created their last forum post on 12th December and continued occasionally responding to emails for a little longer, staying in touch with BTC developer Gavin Andresen until at least April.\\n\\nSatoshi Nakamoto last message on the Bitcoin Forum\\n\\nNakamoto has not been involved in any of the changes since then.\\n\\n\\nThanks for reading my answer!

It can be used to maintain a record of the cost of these goods and services. Earlier we had Gold and other metals as currency. It was later replaced by Paper currency. Now we have Credit Cards.\\n\\nWhenever we give a bill or note (paper currency), the shopkeepers accepts it. They know that they can spend this money again to purchase from some one else. We carry this money in our wallets. We use it wherever we want too. We can use it in the middle of the night. The seller gets paid immediately.\\n\\nThen came credit cards and digital payments. Now you are ranked based upon a score. Banks track your every transaction. They may or may not allow you to do a particular transaction. Credit card companies hold up shopkeeper\\u2019s funds for months.\\n\\nSome people decided to create a new form of currency i.e Bitcoin. It is supposed to work as cash i.e. paper currency. Any person can create a wallet. He can load his wallets with Bitcoins and spend at his will. You can purchase it via Dollars, Rupees, Pounds, Yen etc. There is fluctuation in the price of USD/INR, USD/GBP and others depending upon a countries growth, demand for their currency, their expenditure etc. Similarly, the price of Bitcoin fluctuates with its development, adoption, innovation, and usage.\\n\\nSecond thing Satoshi Nakamoto wanted was to create a system where no bank or government can control Bitcoin. He achieved by making it decentralised. He published the paper about Bitcoin and asked people to help him with development. Like other open source softwares, developers update Bitcoins. These developers do not work for any body. They write code because they believe Bitcoin can change the world. Hundreds of different developers around the world write and review Bitcoin code and make it more secure and easy for people to use.\\n\\nBanks have their own centralised servers. They may maintain a copy of these servers in different places just to avoid any downtime. We have seen in past how these banks can be hacked and millions of Dollars are poured out of people\\u2019s accounts. In Bitcoin, the server is maintained by thousands of computers around the globes. These computers are owned by people like us. Each of these computers have a copy of ledger. The ledger has records of all the transactions that happened with Bitcoin. If somebody needs to hack the Bitcoin, he will have to hack all these computers at once.\\n\\nNow we have a system of unknown and unrelated people who want to transact with each other without the help of any third party. Someone needs to verify these transactions. There are miners which run huge servers for Bitcoin. The purpose of these servers is to verify each transaction and write it in the ledger. As this is an extensive process and requires a lot of computation power, miners get paid for verifying transactions.\\n\\nThere is no single person or group of persons who control the Bitcoins. There are many stakeholders. These are people like us. They want to see a new economic system in the world as they believe the current one is broken and outdated. These people do not know each other. They work because they believe in Bitcoins.\\n\\nLegality of Bitcoin is a topic of debate. Many countries recognise Bitcoin but they have not yet declared it as a legal payment method. Japan now identifies Bitcoin as a legal tender. We have Bitcoin ATMs in US, Singapore, Canada and Europe. We have strict Bitcoin rules in China. India is still not decided on its stance on Bitcoin.\\n\\nTLDR; Bitcoin is a digital cash. It works just like your online wallets. You can send money in your online wallet to your friends, buy stuff online and offline. It is completely online and works 24x7. Bitcoin was created by an anonymous person or group of persons known as Satoshi Nakamoto.

Will the Russians use Bitcoin as a work around? \\n \\nWhile that is a very complicated question involving global finance, geo-political tensions and war, I got a good answer from smart, young Thai woman with simple, but meaningful, insights into the developing world of crypto currencies.\\n\\nThe digital networks Bitcoin and other crypto currencies use are not capable of handling the volume of traffic required to replace the matrix of global finance systems. Blockchains - the digital networks crypto currencies operate on - have not developed sufficiently to provide the speed and volume necessary for the high the amount of transactions required for global money transfers.\\n \\n In this essay I will attempt to explain what Bitcoin and other crypto currencies are in an easy to understand manner. I will also propose that the reason crypto currency networks have not developed into a fast, high volume system capable of moving money efficiently is because of equity speculation. Bitcoin billionaires have inadvertently prevented the development of what the creators of Bitcoin initially envisioned: a global digital currency devoid of a central authority.\\n \\n If you wish to ride on a New York City subway, you might purchase a Metro Card.\\n\\nSimply pay for your Metro Card at an electronic kiosk and the machine will transfer the value of your money and digitally encode the value onto the Metro Card. Your Metro Card now digitally stores the value of your money until you spend it by boarding a train. Metro Cards have limited use. You cannot buy a cup of coffee with a Metro Card. However, in Bangkok, Thailand where I live, the Rabbit Card, Bangkok\\u2019s version of a Metro Card, can be used at a few merchants.\\n\\nBitcoin is similar to a Metro Card. An individual can purchase a Bitcoin (or a portion of a Bitcoin) and the value is noted on a digital network called a blockchain. Blockchains are unique in that they have solved a very difficult problem, how to prevent fraud and counterfeits. They do that basically with thousands of computers that monitor the blockchain. But unlike a Metro Card that has a fixed value, Bitcoin\\u2019s value is determined by an open market. The pioneers of Bitcoin acquired Bitcoins for pennies. Many of those early adopters of Bitcoin became billionaires when the price of Bitcoin soared in open market exchanges. While the early conversation about Bitcoin was how it could replace traditional currency as a method of transferring value, that changed.\\n\\nInvestors began buying Bitcoin and the focus, the narrative, became all about the value of Bitcoin. Stories abounded about the billions of dollars early investors made by buying Bitcoin. Demand for Bitcoins increased motivating technically savvy entrepreneurs to set up online exchanges or brokers. First dozens, now hundreds of other crypto-coins or tokens emerged. With billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin and other coins changing hands by way of blockchain technology, government finance oversight entities became interested and created regulations governing blockchain transactions. The original idea of an anonymous transaction between two parties became an afterthought.\\n \\n In 2017, I became aware of a surge in the price of Bitcoin in South Korea. Because of high local demand, eager South Korean speculators were paying 30% more for Bitcoin than in Bangkok where I live. When illogical price differences happen in a market, say the stock market, there is an opportunity for savvy traders to make a quick profit. Buy in the low market; sell in the high. It is a simple idea stock traders call arbitrage. At the time I knew little about Bitcoin. But this apparent arbitrage opportunity motivated me to learn about Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain network. \\n \\nSimply put, blockchain is a large collection of computers that monitor the blockchain system and double check transactions on that system. Those computers compete to be the computer that verifies the transaction. The successful computer, and its human maintainer, get a commission from the transaction.\\n\\nThere are ways to buy Bitcoin from an individual. Crypto enthusiast call transactions between individuals peer to peer. A person can install an app on their smartphone. By scanning a QR code of another person\\u2019s app, parties can transfer all or part of the value of a Bitcoin from one person to another, peer to peer. However, most holders of crypto currency I was meeting bought and sold their holdings through a central exchange such as Coinbase. \\n \\n What you are actually buying is a digital notation on the blockchain. All you receive is an identifying number. Do not loose it.\\n\\nThe key to success in an arbitrage transaction is execution. Arbitrage traders in the stock market work in specialized environments where intrenched market players can sometimes execute quick trades to exploit a market imbalance. While I was reading stories on social media about people profiting by making arbitrage trades with Bitcoin in South Korea, I realized quickly that I did not have the network necessary to execute such trades. \\n \\nExchanges such as Coinbase have cross border limitations and high fees. While I knew people in Bangkok from whom I could have executed a peer to peer purchase, in Korea, I would have to seek them out. And while that may not have been too difficult given the hot market, it takes six hours to fly from Bangkok to Seoul. \\n \\nThe price of Bitcoin, then and now, is volatile. Thirty percent price swings are common. I could buy Bitcoin in Bangkok and when I got off the plane in Seoul, my investment may have dropped dramatically in value while I was enjoying my expensive plane ride. I opted out of a Bitcoin arbitrage scheme, but became very interested in blockchain concepts, ideas and technology.\\n\\nLet me dispel one lingering myth about crypto-currency. Blockchain transactions are not untraceable or anonymous. The digital notations on the blockchain are public, a necessary element in the process of preventing duplicate transactions, fraud and counterfeits. These digital notations are identified by encrypted codes known only to the holders of the digital notations. But using AI data analysis and other surveillance, sophisticated parties can determine transaction sources when motivated to do so. If you want to purchase something and be truly untraceable and anonymous, use cash.\\n\\nThe volatility present in the crypto currency market is exacerbated by a feature first touted as a benefit of Bitcoin: there is a limited supply of Bitcoin, by design. The limit in supply theoretically prevents inflation. In the current volatile market of crypto currency, a construct such as inflation is not relevant. The value of goods and services rise, inflate, in relationship to a currency. A stable price has yet to be established from which its purchasing power would be deflated. If your crypto holdings go up and down dramatically, there is no logical way to determine an inflationary relationship with goods and services one might purchase with crypto.\\n\\nWhen a big holder of Bitcoin sells one hundred million dollars of their holdings, that one transaction will affect the price. The market will go down. If a currency trader of US dollars sold one hundred million dollars worth of the US dollar for English pounds, the currency market - measured in hundreds of billions of dollars a day - would not even register the transaction. The lack of depth in the Bitcoin market, its limited supply, adds to the volatile price swings.\\n\\nAnd here is where things get strange. The limited supply of Bitcoin, along with a cabal of early holders owning a significant proportion of the supply, creates an opportunity for market manipulation. Many of these early holders, called whales in the crypto orbit, accumulated large fortunes in the early rise of the value of Bitcoin. And they can easily make the market rise or fall by simply trading with themselves, a practice I have long suspected. Bloomberg News recently uncovered such an inside trade with a new blockchain product, non-fungible tokens, NFTs.\\n\\nNFTs are digital art works now becoming a trendy new use of blockchain. An NFT held by the Trump organization recently sold for over one million dollars. Bloomberg\\u2019s investigation showed the buyer was Melania Trump. The much heralded million dollar transaction falsely suggested there was a real market trading NFTs. While such a trade in US securities would be illegal, NFTs are not yet regulated. The Trump NFT transaction is legal. But it is also a clear indicator of how whales can manipulate the crypto market.\\n\\nBitcoin and other tokens have moved away from the original idea of a digital currency, or mechanism of exchange, to a simple store of value. Some early adopters are now paper billionaires. That kind of wealth is a magnet for others trying to get in on the new investment idea. Digital currencies, however, do not have any underlying value. The price of ownership of digital currencies has risen (and fallen) simply from demand. If the price dropped to zero, a distinct possibility according to many financiers such as Warren Buffet, holders of crypto currency would have nothing. By comparison, ownership of stocks means you have a share of a company. Even is the company went bankrupt, shareholders would get a share of the liquidation. Bonds have similar protections. While big looses are possible in stocks and bonds, holders of such instruments posses a portion of the tangible assets underlying those instruments. There are no tangible assets underlying crypto currency. Warren Buffett\\u2019s partner, Charlie Munger, is very vocal about his objection to idea of crypto currency. He believes the current value of crypto currency is nothing more than a speculative bubble that is bound to pop.\\n\\nIn The Netherlands, in 1637 the price of forward contracts on tulip bulbs , a contract to buy or sell in the future, rose to a very high price. Exuberant demand created history\\u2019s first recorded finance bubble. When the bubble popped, people holding the contracts went broke.\\n\\nIn 1929, a highly inflated stock market crashed in large part due to trading on margin. Margin trading is where stock holders borrow against their stock holdings. The bubble once again popped. Traders were jumping out windows.\\n\\nIn 2007, finance instruments called Credit Default Swaps (CDS) and Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDO) propped up global real estate markets. The value of CDOs and CDSs soared. Once again the bubble popped sending the world into the Great Recession.\\n\\nDid these finance catastrophes cause traders to discontinue buying and selling the offending finance instruments?\\n \\n Of course not!\\n \\n Margin trading is currently huge. CDSs and CDOs trade in trillions of dollars, and forward contracts on commodities are common. Additionally, when the tulip contracts crashed, the holders still had pretty flowers. The question to ask about crypto currency is if and when the speculative mania now dominating digital currencies goes away, will there be any underlying value?\\n\\nThe answer is a firm yes. But the value will not be in tangible assets such as real estate, company shares or tulips. It is the blockchain network itself that very well may transform the global movement of money.\\n\\nMook is a smart twenty-two year old Thai woman I met at a Bitcoin Cash meetup in Bangkok last year. Bitcoin Cash is a digital currency spinoff of Bitcoin. Mook and a few other young people were approaching local Bangkok merchants, mostly bars, restaurants and hotels and encouraging the proprietors to accept Bitcoin Cash as payment method. Mook and her entourage of good looking young folks would show the prospective merchants the ease with which they could download an app onto their smart phone and right away begin transferring value to and from other Bitcoin Cash holders. A resurgence of COVID closed Thailand to tourists and put a stop to Mook\\u2019s efforts. The ultimate users of Bitcoin Cash, Mook\\u2019s target consumers, were tourists. There are not many Thais buying crypto currency.\\n\\nMook confirmed her friends\\u2019 efforts promoting Bitcoin Cash were funded by Roger Ver, a Bitcoin Whale. Mook was quick to point out that she was not paid.\\n\\n\\u201c\\u2026I\\u2019m not funded by Roger. I know some people that got funded by him but I just do it on my own\\\", declared Mook.\\n\\nRoger pivoted his focus away from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash and is now the man behind the curtain pulling the levers of promotion for Bitcoin Cash. From my observation of Mook and her crew\\u2019s efforts last year, the objective of this Roger Ver backed enterprise is indeed attempting to get Bitcoin Cash established as a usable currency in retail establishments. I am wondering though if there exist a natural tension between the holder of valuable equity and a functional crypto currency. They might be mutually exclusive states. If the market value of Bitcoin Cash drops dramatically and erodes a managing whale\\u2019s fortune, would that not shift their efforts toward maintaining their fortune?\\n\\nA year has passed since Mook and her Bitcoin Cash crew were promoting the use of crypto currency in Thai retail businesses. I had a long, pleasant conversation over coffee with Mook about her perspective on the use of crypto currency going forward. With impressive insight into finance realities, Mook wrapped up our conversation saying that she, and other middle class Thais, would never buy crypto currency as an investment. It is too volatile and risky. But Mook would use crypto currency as money if a fast, reliable network becomes available.\\n\\nAnother businessman I know well here in Bangkok has been working on developing cross border micro-payment systems using blockchain since 2014. This gentleman, let\\u2019s call him Stan, worked at high levels in the crypto-currency world until recently when he formed his own company. Stan was frustrated with how holders of crypto currency focused their attention on maintaining equity rather than developing payment networks. Now on his own with a few partners, Stan hopes to maintain that focus, getting the blockchain developed as a usable network rather than a speculation device. When I asked Stan if he thought the turmoil in the movement of money caused by the Ukraine crisis might be an interruption to the status quo that might change the path of blockchain development, Stan shrugged.\\n \\n Nobody knows the answer."}, {"upvote": 27, "content": " * Digital Currency: Bitcoin is the first of its kind digital currency (popularly called cryptocurrency), launched in January 2009.\\n * Underlying Technology & Transparency: There is no physical form of Bitcoin available. Its balance is kept on a decentralized public ledger (also called blockchain), which can be accessed by everyone, thereby providing unprecedented transparency. A massive amount of computing power verifies all Bitcoin transactions.\\n * Bitcoin: What you can do with it? You can:\\n * \\n * Create or mine Bitcoin\\n * Distribute Bitcoin\\n * Trade Bitcoin\\n * Store Bitcoin\\n\\n * What\\u2019s so Special?\\n * \\n * Absolutely Decentralized: The most exciting thing about Bitcoin (denoted as BTC) is that unlike government-issued currencies it is not issued or backed by any government or bank.\\n * High Popularity Despite being Legal Tenders: Though they are not legal tenders, they are very high in popularity among investors. It is the increasing popularity of Bitcoin that led to the launch of around 5,000 other altcoins.\\n * Lower Transaction Fees: BTC promises to lower transaction fees than any other traditional online payment mechanism.\\n\\n * Understanding Bitcoin in Simple Words\\nBitcoins are a collection of nodes (master nodes and simple nodes) that are nothing but computers. These computers run the code of Bitcoin and consequently store its blockchain.\\n\\nEach blockchain is a collection of blocks. Each block, in turn, is a collection of transactions. The best thing about this system is its transparency, making it unlikely for anyone (including those who started it) to cheat the system.\\n\\nAll the computers that run the blockchain have the same block and transaction list. Everyone (whether they run a \\u201cnode\\u201d or not) can see the new Bitcoin transactions occurring live and filling up the blocks one after the other. Cheating this system is unlikely.\\n\\nDoes that mean no one can cheat the Bitcoin System?\\n\\nIf a bad actor has to carry out a nefarious action, he/she has to operate 51% of the computing power that makes up the Bitcoin. As of May 2020, there are 47,000 nodes. Therefore, cheating this elaborate system is highly unlikely.\\n\\nNow, suppose a bad actor carries out an attack. In such a case, the people who are running the nodes or the computers will most probably carry out a fork to a new blockchain. This will make the attack a wastage of time, resources, and effort of the bad actor.\\n\\n * Should you invest in Bitcoin? Why?\\nAbsolutely. What are you waiting for? You should invest now because of the following reasons:\\n\\n * Outstanding Prospect of Growth in 2021\\nAlmost all analysts are predicting a bull run in 2021 as they are expecting the mass adoption of BTC in the near future.\\n\\n * Nexo co-founder Antoni Trenchev has said that by 2021-end, the Bitcoin price is expected to rise to $50,000.\\n * A respected on-chain analyst has said that one of his economic models a 10-time price appreciation to around $200,000-to-$300,000 by 2021-end or early 2022.\\n * Many analysts believe that the next most logical target is the US$24,800 Fib level (just below US$25,000).\\n * Phenomenal Performance in 2020\\nBitcoin price has increased by around 170% in 2020. If we consider the lows during the COVID-19 crash in March 2020, the bounceback is phenomenal. Since the lows of March, the BTC price against the US Dollar has increased by around 400%.\\n\\n * JPMorgan Analysts believe BTC will Present Itself as an Alternative to Gold in terms of Store of Value\\nA Bloomberg report says that the analysts of JPMorgan investment bank believe that BTC will continue to gain traction and may present a bear case for gold.\\n\\n\\u201cThe adoption of bitcoin by institutional investors has only begun, while for gold its adoption by institutional investors is very advanced.\\u201d\\n\\nBillions of dollars worth of investment can potentially flow from gold to Bitcoin. Therefore, in the coming time, the gold may lose its shine as BTC\\u2019s prospects brighten.\\n\\n * 62% Market Capitalization\\nOn December 10, 2020, the market cap of Bitcoin was US$341,785,729,235, out of the total global market capitalization of US$546,541,275,989. BTC\\u2019s market share is 62%, the highest in the cryptocurrency market. Its price movement largely defines the overall movement of the market.\\n\\n * Big Players are Investing Heavily\\n * \\n * Big-time investors such as BlackRock\\u2019s Rick Rieder, Paul Tudor Jones, Stanley Druckenmiller, and Bill Miller are parking more and more of their capital in Bitcoin and other altcoins.\\n * Payment companies such as PayPal and Square are continuing to funnel more retail capital into Bitcoin and other cryptos.\\n\\n * Big Players are Buying at Lows\\nUnlike 2017\\u2019s bear run (when the BTC value tanked to 3,500-level), this time it\\u2019ll be decent corrections. On December 9, 2020, the BTC/USD pair breached the US$18,000 level and moved downwards to US$17,640.56 and at one point in time exchange data showed buyer interest lined up at the US$16,200-level.\\n\\nWhen asked about the prospects of the Bitcoin market, Cointelegraph Markets analyst Micha\\u00ebl van de Poppe and many others said that their overall estimate is positive because many big investors including Grayscale, Paypal, Square, MicroStrategy, and many others are buying at lower levels as the small crypto \\u201ctraders, shitcoiners, and weak hands\\u201d sell-off.\\n\\nThey believe the downtrend will continue until the US$18,500-18,700 level is reclaimed. Currently, the BTC/USD price is revolving around US$18,022.35. So, time your entry by checking the technical charts and you\\u2019ll most definitely reap the benefit in the coming year.\\n\\n * Can I invest US$100 to buy Bitcoin?\\nYes, you can buy a portion of a single Bitcoin. However, always keep in mind that you\\u2019ve to give a certain commission for purchasing BTC. If you are paying US$10 for buying US$10,000 of Bitcoin, it means you are just paying 0.1% in fees. However, if you give US$10 fees for buying US$100 Bitcoin, you\\u2019re 10% in fees. While investing US$100, you should keep this thing in mind.

So many many years ago traders accepted gold/precious metals etc in exchange for the services they provided . So a medium of exchange for services was gold (i.e. Money) .\\n\\nBut there was a problem .As they frequently travelled far across the states for business , keeping those heavy chunks of gold/metals etc was quite a tough task and posed problems (like carrying the gold,managing it etc) .\\n\\nTo solve the above problem , it was thought out that instead of carrying actual gold , traders would deposit their gold in a third party which they trusted and get from them a piece of paper declaring that the piece of paper was worth the amount of gold they had deposited (i.e. Currency) .

It can be used to buy goods and services, hold value, and do many other things a currency typically does.\\n\\nHowever, Bitcoin has no physical existence; it only has a digital existence. There are stark differences between bitcoin and other currencies. For instance, it lacks a central regulatory authority such as a central bank. Such radical issues initially made the currency get a lot of legal and political opposition in its first years of existence after it was introduced in 2009.\\n\\nThere are riveting benefits to this virtual currency such as greater transactional security, faster payments, and lower transaction costs have made its relevance in the modern financial world more apparent. This is why many countries now recognize the new-age currency and the groundbreaking technology on which it is based.\\n\\nHow does It Work?\\n\\nThere is a bit of confusion as to how bitcoin works. The process is quite simple.\\n\\nFirst of all, you should have a bitcoin wallet installed on your computer or mobile device so that you can have a Bitcoin address. You are free to have all the addresses you want. Anyway, with this address, you can make payments and receive payments in form of bitcoin.\\n\\nIt is more like email, but you get and send payments, not messages. The wallets also have a private key, also called a seed. This private key is used to sign the transactions in order to verify them as having originated from that particular wallet.\\n\\nTherefore, the transactions cannot be modified by anyone. These transactions are confirmed by computers in the network through a process called mining, and they are made part of the public ledger by being added to the blockchain.\\n\\nThe blockchain is a public ledger that details all the transactions that take place within the network. This system verifies all transactions independent of any single party, therefore ensuring security and transparency. This system is protected using cryptography.\\n\\nIs It Legal?\\n\\nThe answer to this question can be yes, no or undefined; depending on the country or region you are talking about.\\n\\nIn some countries, Bitcoin exists in a legal gray area, where it is neither legal or illegal. In others, there are laws that clearly give cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin a legal standing, allowing its use for commerce within the country.\\n\\nWhereas, in other countries, there are laws that clearly outlaw the use of this and other virtual currency. For instance, Bitcoin is legal in the USA and European Union as it is recognized as a currency. It is even subject to taxes that other currencies are subjected to when used in trade. The G7 has also given Bitcoin a legal status, although this comes with concerns that the currency may pose risks that regular currencies might not give their users.\\n\\nAt the same time, there are countries that have made laws that have made an absolute ban on the use of Bitcoin. Examples include Egypt, Bolivia, Saudi Arabia and others. In some countries, the ban is issued with regard to the use of this currency within the banking system, although it is legal for other financial situations.\\n\\nThese countries include Jordan, India, Thailand and others. In a country like Vietnam, it is legal to hold and trade in Bitcoin, but it is illegal to use it as a payment tool.\\n\\nIn other countries, Bitcoin is neither legal or illegal, and people use it without the risk of any legal consequences because there are no laws limiting or regulating its use. However, generally speaking, Bitcoin is legal in a majority of countries; and the number of countries that are lifting bans on its use continues to grow as the technology gains more acceptance in the mainstream financial world.\\n\\nWho Runs It?\\n\\nNobody runs bitcoin; or more accurately, all its have a say in how it operates. This is different from the way regular currencies are operated. With regular currencies, value, inflation, supply and so forth is often dictated by a central authority.\\n\\nBitcoin, computers around the world work together to create bitcoins, with the ultimate number of coins that will constitute the bitcoin network set at 21 million. Its value is also determined by the laws of supply and demand.\\n\\nHow Can You Participate in It?\\n\\nBeing a bitcoin user or trader is very easy. You can join a broker that offers bitcoin trading, open an account and fund it with fiat currency and then use these funds to trade bitcoin. Similarly, you can open a bitcoin wallet, put money in it using regular currency and then use this currency to buy bitcoins and hold it in your wallet.\\n\\nThe other option is using a cryptocurrency exchange, which can give you bitcoins in exchange for regular currency. You can then withdraw this money into your cryptocurrency wallet, where bitcoin and other virtual currencies can be held and used to trade, make payments and do everything else that pertains to the use of a currency.\\n\\nCan You Make Money with Bitcoin?\\n\\nYes, you can make money with Bitcoin, but this is highly subjective. If you know how to trade in currencies, then you can trade in bitcoin at various exchanges and make money as currency values around the world rise and fall.\\n\\nYou can also speculate on bitcoin\\u2019s future value and buy or sell units of the currency with the hope of making a profit in future when the trend you expected happens.\\n\\nHowever, just as with other financial assets, attempts to make a profit using Bitcoin come with risks of loss. So, make sure you know what you are doing as you try to make money through this virtual currency for you to actually turn a profit.\\n\\nHow Bitcoin (BTC), Cryptocurrency and Blockchain will Change Our Lives\\n\\nThe future of finance is believed to belong to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Banking institutions are already starting to embrace the blockchain technology on which these currencies are based as they offer a greater level of security during transactions. People will also take up the use of bitcoin more readily as it offers safer, faster, and a more globally accepted way of making and receiving payments in comparison to the traditional currencies.\\n\\nAs we speak, there are countries where residents are turning to bitcoin due to the instabilities the local currency offers due to political or economic issues facing them.\\n\\nAn example is Venezuela. This trend is likely to grow in future as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies exceed traditional currencies in acceptability around the world. Other sectors will change because of BTC and the blockchain technology as well. For instance, cloud storage services can use the encryption technology that blockchain systems use to ensure that data does not suffer any unauthorized modifications or access.\\n\\nEven with regard to Internet of Things (IoT), bitcoin and its seminal blockchain technology has something to offer in future. Currently, this system works with a centralized technology, which is susceptible to hacks and other security issues. However, by being decentralized and encrypted like blockchain technology, it will be much safer for everybody.\\n\\nSo yes, bitcoin and blockchain technology will change the future in a big way.\\n\\nOne to One Consulting:\\n\\nTo learn how you can personally participate in Bitcoin, ICOs and Cryptocurrencies: Call me on +44 (0)7932 394629\\n\\nTo learn more visit my courses on Udemy:\\n\\nCryptocurrency/Bitcoin - Made Easy (First Timer's Guide) Learn How Cryptocurrencies Work and How You Can Make Money & Get Involved In This New Movement\\n\\nThanks for reading this answer.\\n\\nGod bless you\\n\\nBoomy"}, {"upvote": 3, "content": "What is Bitcoin?\\n\\nBitcoin, often described as a cryptocurrency, a virtual currency or a digital currency - is a type of money that is completely virtual.\\n\\nIt's like an online version of cash.

And that is : \\u201cIf I hear the words \\u201cDecentralized currency\\u201d one more time, I am gonna personally find Satoshi Nakamoto and decentralize him\\u201d.\\n\\nRight, so let\\u2019s see what Decentralized currency means later. For now, let\\u2019s see what is Currency.\\n\\nCurrency is a tool which we use to exchange values. Earlier people were using Gold and other valuable metals to exchange with goods required by them. Gold was tangible. If a certain amount of Gold were to be in your hand, it basically meant you owned it.\\n\\nDue to Gold\\u2019s obvious disadvantages, we started using paper money. What we currently are acquainted with is something called Fiat Currency. Which means we are basically assuming that a particular piece of paper is worth some value.\\n\\n*I promise to pay the bearer(of this note) the sum of one hundred rupees*\\n\\nNowadays most of the money is just in the form of numbers. So there is a possibility that the same money can be used for multiple transactions. This problem is called as \\u201cDouble Spending\\u201d.\\n\\nTo avoid this, banks keep a ledger to keep track of all the transactions essentially acting as a Centre. Hence our conventional money is called as Centralized Currency.\\n\\nSome computer scientists were not satisfied with a third party(bank) keeping track of transactions. This is when Satoshi Nakamoto comes in and proposes and entirely different solution where there is no 3rd party involved(decentralized currency). BITCOIN\\n\\nDecentralized currency is like Internet. There is no one entity owning it(yet).\\n\\nThe deal with Bitcoin is that all the transactions are public and the ledger recording those transactions are public. This ledger is called as a BLOCKCHAIN. Everyone can have a copy of it and tally their transactions.\\n\\nThere might be issues regarding security but think of hacking a bitcoin blockchain as hacking english dictionary. You can change the meaning of a word in one dictionary. But not in every other copy in the world.\\n\\nIf you are still reading, I will add more content on it in future."}, {"upvote": 12, "content": "Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that allows users to send money to anybody in the world instantly.

These transactions are confirmed via cryptography by network nodes and stored in a public distributed ledger known as a blockchain, which employs bitcoin as its unit of account. Bitcoins are produced as a result of the mining process. They may be exchanged for a variety of other currencies, goods, and services.\\n\\nIf you are new to the market, I think that you should invest in LUMI since this is a really safe ones to invest in. I invested a lot in this and gained a lot of benefits."}, {"upvote": 1158, "content": "Bitcoin is digital money that you can transfer to another person without the need of a third party, like a bank. It can be thought of as a digital equivalent of cash - it's just one person transferring value to another person, no bank involved. In fact, Bitcoins are not issued by a bank or government, so an even more apt analogy than cash might therefore be gold.\\n\\nOk, digital gold, got it. Weird. Why are people excited?\\n\\n1. Get rid of transaction costs\\n\\nUPDATE 2018\\u201301\\u201303: Bitcoin, due to various technical and political reasons, now has tremendously high transaction costs, several dollars per transaction. Bitcoins main competitor, Etherium [ https://www.ethereum.org/ ], is slightly better in this regard, but I\\u2019m personally banking on Stellar [ https://www.stellar.org/ ] which has very low transaction costs and is getting a lot of attention in recent months.\\n\\nBecause there is no central authority controlling the network, transactions costs are incredibly low compared to existing systems. Banks, card issuers and payment processors places a 1-5% transaction fee on that coffee you bought this morning, and everything else you buy. This is not very visible in everyday life, because it's almost always baked into the price of things, but if you start transferring money internationally with companies like Western Union, you realise that there is quite a bit of money in the business of transferring money.\\n\\n2. Take currency power away from banks and government\\n\\nBanks and government have the legal and physical ability to create money. I won't get into the details (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_creation) of how that works, but the main problem is that whenever money is created, it dilutes the value of everyone's money, which makes it a super-fast, completely silent, taxation.\\n\\nSometimes, governments and banks use this power responsibly, but sometimes, they do not. Lately, there has been a lot of the latter, with the Financial crisis of 2007\\u201308 [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late-2000s_financial_crisis ] caused by irresponsible lending, so a lot of people are starting to think that we probably are more reliant on banks and government that we want to be. An even more current example is Argentina, which has a 11% inflation (!) on its currency. Bitcoin is getting a strong hold there: BitPagos Uses Merchant Processing To Bring Bitcoin To Argentina [ http://thegenesisblock.com/bitpagos-uses-merchant-processing-bring-bitcoin-argentina/ ]\\n\\nHow does it work?\\n\\nBefore I go on, I'd like to point out that you probably don't know how your normal money works. Most people have no idea how money is transferred from one bank to another, or how it's created in the first place.\\n\\nWith that said, all Bitcoin transactions, from the beginning of time, are written down in an enormous, public ledger. When you transfer money from your Bitcoin wallet to another person, you do that by writing this transaction down in the public ledger. Everyone is watching this ledger and has their own copies of it, and so they now know that there is less money in your wallet, and more money in a friend's wallet. So everyone knows how much money each wallet contains. This is where your money is stored, in this public ledger with millions of copies that everyone maintains together. They do, however, not know who owns that wallet - Bitcoin has no notion of identity.\\n\\nSo what's preventing another person from transferring money from my wallet to their own?\\n\\nThis is where cryptography comes in. When your Bitcoin wallet is generated, it's given to you in two parts. One public part, an address, that you give to other people so that they know where to send you money, and a secret part, a key.\\n\\nThe key is used to \\\"sign\\\" transactions. It takes the amount, the sender address, receiver address, and the key, jumbles it together with math, and out comes a signature, that you put in the ledger along with the transactions. Due to how cryptography works, other people can mathematically verify that the person that generated this signature for this transaction must indeed have the key for this wallet. They can, however, not work backwards to what the key actually is - that would take a supercomputer thousands of years to do.\\n\\n\\nShameless plug: If you like my ramblings about programming on Quora, you might enjoy my YouTube show: Fun Fun Function [ https://youtube.com/funfunfunction ]"}, {"upvote": 103, "content": "Bitcoin is an interesting form of currency that has many people wanting to understand more about it.

However, you might still want a separate digital wallet because the cryptocurrency will be secure if hackers ever break into Coinbase. The exchange charges a base rate of 4% before waivers, which means the actual rate paid is less. The company waives part of the transaction fee based on what payment method you use. For example, Coinbase charges a 1.49% rate on bank account and Coinbase USD wallet conversions after the waiver. The company charges 3.99% on debit card or PayPal conversions and up to 1.5% on instant card withdrawals, with a minimum fee of 55 cents.

There is also an instant buy and sell fee of 0.5%.\\n\\nGemini\\n\\nThis crypto exchange offers site insurance to protect users' digital assets against hacks on the exchange. Gemini [ https://www.gemini.com/ ] offers products for both beginner and advanced cryptocurrency investors. There's a simple interface for new investors, while its ActiveTrader platform is designed for advanced investors. Gemini is more expensive than other crypto exchanges, but its fees cover insurance and more features. The company charges trading and transaction fees of up to 1.49%, depending on the trading platform, 3.49% for debit card purchases, and other fees. Gemini also offers a digital wallet. For users of the exchange's website and mobile app, it charges a flat 0.5% \\\"convenience fee\\\" on trading and transactions. In addition, it charges a flat fee ranging from 99 cents to $2.99 for transactions up to $200 and 1.49% of the order value for those higher than $200.\\n\\nCoinmama\\n\\nThis exchange supports fewer cryptocurrencies than the other exchanges on this list and has higher fees. Coinmama [ https://www.coinmama.com/?locale=en ] offers a variety of payment options, including using Visa or Mastercard for transactions. The exchange differs from other exchanges because it doesn't facilitate crypto transactions between two other parties. Instead, it sells bitcoin from its own inventory. Additionally, the company doesn't provide a digital wallet. Coinmama requires a $50 minimum to buy cryptocurrency and a $200 minimum to sell. Trading fees amount to the market rate plus 2% to buy and the market rate plus up to 0.9% to sell. Transaction fees are up to 3.9% on purchases, plus 5% for credit and debit card transactions.\\n\\nSome traditional brokers also offer cryptocurrency trading, including:\\n\\nRobinhood\\n\\nRobinhood is an online brokerage, and it offers bitcoin transactions in a way that brokers offer stock trades. In other words, you can enter different order types for your bitcoin trades, just as you do with stocks. For example, market orders are executed immediately, although Robinhood limits orders so that bitcoin won't sell if the price falls more than 5% than what it was at the time you placed your market sell order or increases more than 1% from when you placed to buy order. This helps protect against volatility, which crypto exchanges do not. Unfortunately, you can't withdraw bitcoin from Robinhood, which you can do with exchanges, although you can sell bitcoin at Robinhood. The company doesn't charge any commission on transactions, instead making money through a pay-order-flow fee that varies according to trade. Robinhood also supports margin trading, which means you can borrow money to buy bitcoin. It charges interest on accounts that trade on margin.\\n\\neToro\\n\\neToro is also an online brokerage, so it offers charts and analysis tools similar to those it offers for stock trading on its platform. Unlike Robinhood, it's a social trading platform that lets you see what other high-profile investors are doing with their bitcoin. You can also copy what they are doing with eToro's CopyTrader. The brokerage also offers practice accounts for those who want to learn how to invest in bitcoin without actually putting any money into it at first. eToro also offers a digital wallet. The company doesn't charge any deposit or trading fees other than spreads. There is also a $5 fee for withdrawals with a minimum amount of $50. Trades on eToro are conducted in U.S. dollars, so there is a conversion fee on withdrawing or depositing in a foreign currency."}, {"upvote": 8, "content": "Here's how to invest in Bitcoin, in 5 easy steps:\\n\\n1.

After so many failed attempt on getting the right platform, I came across CryptohodlerFx Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www.cryptohodlerfx,com) where i get 40% of every investment i made with cryptocurrency every 10 days. It looks to good to be true until i gave it a try and trust me it has been a smooth ride all the way. Don\\u2019t give up on cryptocurrency and join the platform. Trust me, you won\\u2019t care about the price fluctuation anymore. Thank me Later.\\n\\nNote: This is not in any case of me trying to lure you into anything for my own personal financial gain, i am just innocently sharing with you what works for me. You can also make a research on what works for you too.\\n\\nWith all that preamble over, let's dive into the steps involved in a smart bitcoin investment.\\n\\nStep 1: Choose a Crypto Exchange or Platform\\n\\nYour first step of course will be to choose where to buy your crypto.\\n\\nLike USD, bitcoin is the same no matter where you \\u201cwithdraw\\u201d it from. Therefore, your primary considerations will be safety, convenience and fees.\\n\\nWe've published a whole story on the best crypto exchanges, but to help narrow your search, here are my top three picks for beginners.\\n\\nFor Most Beginners: Coinbase\\n\\n * Pros: Extremely user-friendly; a publicly traded company; earn free crypto with Coinbase Learn.\\n * Cons: High trading fees; can't control wallet keys.\\nCoinbase is a household name for crypto buying for a reason. It's not only the first crypto exchange to go public; it's also the softest landing pad for crypto beginners.\\n\\nCoinbase knows that crypto investing can be a little intimidating, so it designed its buying process to be as streamlined as possible. You pretty much just sign up, attach a payment method and \\u2014 boom \\u2014 buy crypto like it's Amazon.\\n\\nPlus you can earn free crypto by watching short training videos on Coinbase Learn.\\n\\nCoinbase's Learn and Earn\\n\\nThe chief drawback to Coinbase is that it charges higher-than-average fees: up to $2.99 per transaction plus a spread fee of around 0.50% between purchase and sale prices.\\n\\nBut due to convenience, safety and customer service, many traders stick with Coinbase for the long haul.\\n\\nStep 2: Connect Your Bank Account to the Exchange\\n\\nStep 2 is pretty straightforward \\u2014 at some point, your chosen crypto exchange is going to ask you to connect a bank account as your primary payment method. Hand \\u2019em your bank account and routing numbers and you're good to go.\\n\\nAs simple as it is, Step 2 does raise a common question:\\n\\nCan I Buy Crypto With a Credit Card?\\n\\nIn most cases, no. In fact, Coinbase, like most crypto exchanges, won't even let you add a credit card.\\n\\nHere's why: Most banks treat crypto purchases like cash advances. Therefore, your bank will immediately charge you a cash-advance fee of 3% to 5% of the purchase amount. It also won't give you a grace period, meaning you'll accumulate high interest on your crypto purchase immediately. Heck, if the exchange isn't U.S. based, it'll even charge you a foreign transaction fee on top of everything else, just for good measure.\\n\\nBut banks don't mind wiring the money from your bank account to the exchange. The reason is simple: That's your money, not theirs.\\n\\nSo if you were hoping that your bitcoin investment would earn you some rewards points on the side, sorry to burst your bubble.\\n\\nStep 3: Place an Order\\n\\nNow that you've registered for an account and attached your bank account, it's finally time to buy some bitcoin!\\n\\nOn most exchanges, you're never more than a click or two away from buying bitcoin. Click the big Buy/Sell button and you'll be brought to a page like this one from Coinbase:\\n\\nCoinbase's Buy Window\\n\\nNext question: How much should you buy?\\n\\nWell, this article is more of a how to than a how much. But since we're here, I will say this to help you come up with an initial purchase amount:\\n\\n1. Re-familiarize yourself with the \\u201cBefore Investing\\u201d section above.\\n2. Determine your risk tolerance.\\n3. Speak to your wealth advisor (or consider getting one) to determine how much of your portfolio you should dedicate to very-high-risk investments.\\n4. Start small \\u2014 Put in a small fraction of a paycheck and watch how it performs over time.\\n5. Finally, don't worry about purchasing round numbers (like 1 BTC for $50,000) since exchanges support partial coins.\\nIf you're getting cold feet, remember that you can always earn free crypto, risk free, through Coinbase Learn or from bitcoin mining."}, {"upvote": 1, "content": "If you\\u2019re looking to trade Bitcoin, the good news is that you now have several options.

Any financial decision taken at the behest of this post is at own risk.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nFrom studying Price Action and submitting the time to read price, i understand that the markets are completely manipulated, plus with the added advantage of knowledge of human psychology, i sensed here that the big banks and financial institutions would manipulate the uninformed traders by creating a false Break Of Structure(Showing more bullishness) then dumb it hard on them like it did in April 21.\\n\\nAnd why not?\\n\\nPREMISE: The market is in a business of selling, they are in it for profit. Of course a lot of people saw BTC hit ATH and probably thought it would keep going \\u201cTO THE MOON\\u201d.\\n\\nThe Result?\\n\\nA lot of people that were initially skeptical of buying BTC during the entire bull run(Perhaps due to paranoia over a past failed investment decision) and saw it hit another ATH while their friends and all of social media seemed to be profiting from the move.\\n\\nFOMO sets in, they join in to buy! A lot of un-informed traders also buy BTC at ATH due to the fear of missing out in case it \\u201cGoes to the moon\\u201d and hit $178k or $1m like some very ambitious YouTubers were calling.\\n\\nMe knowing all of that, also knowing that the general retail traders are usually wrong 90% of the time.. I have automatically conditioned myself over the years to always think the opposite of what the general public is doing, and think like the people making the markets.\\n\\nThen i asked myself,\\n\\n\\u201cIf i was a seller in control of supply in this market, knowing that a lot of people would be willing to buy all of my supplies at premium prices, what would i do?\\u201d I\\u2019d definitely sell most of the positions i accumulated at discount\\u201d\\n\\nSo i anticipated this move instead.\\n\\nThen i waited for price to show its hand, which it did by by doing this.\\n\\nFrom here.. Using pure Price Action, we can all see it made an attempt to rally further at the beginning of Nov 2021, after creating a new ATH but it immediately rejected higher prices before falling impulsively breaking an immediate low at $60k.\\n\\nTrigger\\n\\nWhen i saw that happen, that was my trigger. It was tipping my hand and immediately, my conviction of taking a sell just increased by 30%.\\n\\nSo there i had my entry which would be at the neckline of the trypical Heads and shoulders pattern that the public see.\\n\\nNow i had an Entry, where would be my Exit?\\n\\nIf price would then fall all the way down to 40k or below to knock off the \\u2018weak holders\\u2019 who would panic sell or \\u201cthe sheep\\u201d who would get Liquidated out of their existing position or by trying to \\u201cbuy the dip\\u201d\\n\\nMy entry, of course..

It works across international borders and doesn't need to be backed by banks or governments.\\n\\nOr at least that was the promise when it was created in 2009.

Mt.Gox, once the largest exchange, shut down in 2014 after losing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin after a hack.\\n\\nToday, the leading exchange is offered by Coinbase, a startup that has raised more than $200 million from a number of top tier venture capital firms.

Start earning today!\\n\\nWhat is cryptocurrency?\\n\\nCryptocurrency is digital currency that is not backed by any central bank. It's decentralized, meaning no one person controls it. It uses cryptography to secure transactions and control the creation of new units of currency. Cryptocurrencies can be used to purchase goods and services, but they are also traded on exchanges like stocks. The price of cryptocurrency varies with supply and demand. The more people who want to buy or sell at any given time, the higher its price will go. If there aren't enough buyers at a certain price level, sellers might lower their asking prices to unload coins quicker. Bitcoin was the first type of cryptocurrency created in 2009 by an unknown programmer named Satoshi Nakamoto. As opposed to traditional currencies such as the U.S. dollar or euro, bitcoin doesn\\u2019t have a centralized governing body such as a country\\u2019s central bank regulating it. Bitcoins are created as payments for validating transactions for those using other forms of cryptocurrency.\\n\\nInvesting in cryptocurrency\\n\\nThe process of investing in cryptocurrency can be overwhelming at first, but it's not too hard to get started. You'll need to start by setting up an account on Coinbase. Once you have a Coinbase account, you can transfer funds from your bank account and buy bitcoin (BTC). Next, send the bitcoin to your personal wallet (e.g. myetherwallet) and store it there until you're ready to use it for investment purposes or trade with another party.\\n\\n1. Register on Coinbase\\n\\n2. Transfer funds\\n\\n3. Buy BTC\\n\\n4. Send BTC to personal wallet\\n\\n5. Keep funds stored in personal wallet\\n\\n6. Trade BTC 7. When you want to trade bitcoin, log back into Coinbase\\n\\n8. Select Accounts and then Send\\n\\n9. Select Bitcoin\\n\\n10. Enter the recipient address\\n\\n11. Enter the amount\\n\\n12. Verify everything is correct\\n\\n13. Select Pay\\n\\n14. Review\\n\\n15. A confirmation email will be sent to both parties 16. After about one hour, the bitcoin will show as confirmed in both wallets . At this point, the sender has successfully transferred ownership of their bitcoin to the receiver. Now that you know how to purchase Bitcoin, let's talk about how to invest with them! To invest in cryptocurrencies, you'll need a digital wallet and some spare cash. I recommend buying some Ethereum and keeping it secure in your digital wallet until there are good investment opportunities (e.g., when prices are low). If you have any questions about anything we've discussed here please feel free to contact us!\\n\\nEarning free cryptocurrency\\n\\nBitcoin is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in use, and it allows you to earn cryptocurrency without investing in it. The easiest way to do so is by joining an online service called CoinPot. CoinPot includes over 40 different coins, including Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), and Dogecoin (DOGE). All you have to do is sign up for an account with them, and then they will give you 10% of whatever coins you mine! That means that if you mine 100 DOGE, CoinPot will credit your account with 10 DOGE. It\\u2019s as easy as that! Another option would be to invest in bitcoin mining equipment such as ASIC miners or cloud mining contracts through companies like Hashflare or Genesis Mining. These provide more than just bitcoins; many also produce other altcoins like Ethereum, Dash, Monero and Zcash. There are three ways to mine Bitcoin. First is solo mining which entails using computer resources and applying brute force to find Bitcoins on its own \\u2013 this can take a long time to generate any significant income. Second is pool mining which means working together with others in a pool where the reward can vary depending on how much work has been done by each miner but on average generates around 1 BTC per month - however there are hidden costs associated with running hardware 24/7 which may not make it profitable.\\n\\nTrading cryptocurrency for profit\\n\\nThe easiest way to trade cryptocurrency is through an online exchange, such as Coinbase. Once you have opened your account and connected it to your bank account, you can start buying and selling currencies. It\\u2019s important to note that the price of Bitcoin will fluctuate constantly, so don\\u2019t go in with all of your savings! If you want to trade cryptocurrency for profit, make sure you are constantly monitoring the market for opportunities. For example, if you notice that one currency has been dropping steadily over a few days but another has been slowly rising then this could be a good opportunity to buy into the latter currency. You may not get rich quick with this method, but if done right it can lead to some decent profits over time.\\n\\nCheck Out How To Get Rich With Bitcoin Even If You Have No Clue About Technology.

They will have all kinds of explanations of how they do this.\\n\\nHere is a debunking of the most common recovery methods:\\n\\nLawyers:\\n\\nWhat they promise: we will prosecute thieves and force them to return stolen Bitcoin\\n\\nWhy it won\\u2019t work:\\n\\nIn almost all cases, you won\\u2019t know the identity of the people who stole your Bitcoin. It\\u2019s nearly impossible to find out the real-world identity of the owner of a given Bitcoin address.\\n\\nEven if you have a name, email address, \\u201cregistered trading account,\\u201d website, etc, it will be very difficult to obtain the cooperation of the police in getting their real-world identity.\\n\\nThe police don\\u2019t care about \\u201csmall-scale\\u201d theft. In most cases, the thieves will be in a different country than you. Furthermore, unlike cash, there is no paper trail to follow. Bitcoin/cryptocurrency is generally considered \\u201cproperty\\u201d rather than money, and hacking isn\\u2019t given the same weight as theft of physical goods. All of this makes authorities unlikely to pursue cases.\\n\\nHe\\u2019s lying. Binance does not have bank accounts all over, and they have never returned a deposit of scammed funds.\\n\\nEven when the identity of the thieves is definitely known, the Bitcoin is rarely returned. The only cases where Bitcoin has been recovered in theft has been in a class-action lawsuit (such as with Mt Gox). Even then, it usually takes thousands of victims, at least tens of millions of dollars stolen, expensive attorneys, and many years.\\n\\nI\\u2019m not saying it\\u2019s impossible. Just don\\u2019t expect to send a random lawyer $5000-$10,000 (typical \\u201crecovery\\u201d fees) and anything useful to happen. It\\u2019s a scam.\\n\\n\\u201cEthical hackers\\u201d\\n\\nWhat they promise: we will hack the thieves and get them to return your Bitcoin.\\n\\nWhy it won\\u2019t work:\\n\\nFirst, anyone who was able to steal your money is already a sophisticated hacker. Most \\u201chackers\\u201d prey on the technologically ignorant. Anyone capable of stealing your Bitcoin probably knows the tricks of so-called \\u201cethical hackers\\u201d.\\n\\nSecond, it\\u2019s nearly impossible to find out the real-world identity from a Bitcoin address or an email address. If the U.S. government struggles to find find out who operates darknet markets, what hope has some hacker you paid $1000?\\n\\nThird, even an \\u201cethical hacker\\u201d has to break into someone else\\u2019s systems \\u2014 and probably break some laws in the process. If they could someone break into people\\u2019s computers to get their Bitcoin, why should they return it to you? Why do they need you at all? If they can hack people\\u2019s computers to steal Bitcoin, they are just as likely to steal yours.\\n\\nThere are no credible, independent reports of anyone successfully doing this. \\u201cEthical hackers\\u201d that return Bitcoin for cash upfront simply do not exist. It\\u2019s a scam.\\n\\nBlockchain hackers\\n\\nWhat they promise: we will hack Bitcoin or brute force your private key to reverse the transaction and return your Bitcoin.\\n\\nWhy it won\\u2019t work:\\n\\nThe market cap of Bitcoin is nearly $700 billion dollars. Every single Bitcoin transaction and address is public. If someone could steal or reverse a Bitcoin transaction, they wouldn\\u2019t be helping you. They would be going after the richest Bitcoin wallets worth tens of billions of dollars. [ https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin/rich-list/ ] Of course, once it got out that Bitcoin could be hacked, the exploit would either be patched, or Bitcoin would become worthless.\\n\\nNo matter how brilliant they claim to be, it\\u2019s a scam.\\n\\nChainalysis\\n\\nWhat they claim: we will trace Bitcoin transaction to the service holding them, and force them to return your money.\\n\\nWhy it won\\u2019t work:\\n\\nChainalysis is a real thing. There are companies [ https://www.chainalysis.com/ ] that keep databases of addresses used by criminals and gambling sites, and help exchanges ban those customers. Unfortunately, they can\\u2019t help you for a few reasons:\\n\\nFirst, they have expensive products for businesses and governments than the random recovery service you found online probably doesn\\u2019t have access to.\\n\\nSecond, the most they can do is trace which major exchange or business got your Bitcoin. At this point, you would need the cooperation of the exchange to tell you which customer made that deposit. That cooperation is impossible to obtain without a court order, which as previously explained is nearly impossible to obtain. Furthermore, thieves don\\u2019t use cooperative exchanges in the first place, since they require KYC.  [ https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Know_your_customer ]If they want to cash out, they are going to use some less-reputable service in a country that probably does not cooperate with your government.\\n\\nThird, once your crypto hits an exchange, it\\u2019s impossible to trace what a given customer does with it next. If someone simply deposits Bitcoin with an exchange, you will never know when they take it out or move it. This is because exchanges combine all their funds, so your stolen Bitcoin will be given to whoever requests a withdrawal first. It will not be withdrawn by the person who deposited it.\\n\\nFourth, criminals don\\u2019t keep Bitcoin at exchanges. In my experience, they will either sit on it for years or cash it out immediately. They are not stupid enough to keep it where it can be confiscated, however unlikely that is.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s a scam.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nIt is nearly impossible to return your stolen cryptocurrency.
