Buying one in 2010 at 0.08$ a coin would now make you 14000$ a coin for every coin that you bought. Which means if you invested 100$ into Bitcoins in 2010 they would be worth a whopping 17.5 million dollars today.  Are bitcoins the future? Or are they going to crash and burn?  Instead of telling you to invest in it or not, what I'm going to do is outline some facts about bitcoin as an investment and tell you about what happened with bubbles in the past. And then you can decide.  Flashback no. 1  The Dot com bubble, 2000  Fueled by the rise of companies with a .com after their name, the .com bubble saw the price of the NASDAQ jump from 1000 to 5000 over 5 years. This was a 500% increase and was fueled by purely speculative investments.  Fundamentals were thrown away. People were rushing to buy any internet based company, ignoring the fact that these companies wouldn't be making any money for the next few years. Money was cheap. Funding was easy. A bubble was formed.  And like all bubbles, it burst in 2001. Companies that had a market capitalization of hundreds of millions were now worth 0. The stock market rapidly declined. Trillions of dollars of investors money was lost.  Flashback no. 2  The housing bubble, 2006/2007  After the recession the .com bubble caused, interest rates started to drop. Investors abandoned the stock market and turned to real estate. Lending requirements all but vanished. Housing prices started to go up. Speculators entered the market and made tens of thousands of dollars in weeks. A bubble was formed.  And like all bubbles, it burst in 2007/2008 with the collapse of Lehmann Brothers, causing the largest recession in history since World War II. Millions of dollars were lost. Homes were destroyed. It took the economy years to recover.  What is the definition of a bubble in finance?  A bubble occurs when the price of a stock or investment is driven up to unsustainably high levels, substantially way more than what that item is worth. This bubble is usually caused by emotions of the masses, and not by logical investing or looking at fundamentals. And it always starts off as something that made sense in the beginning.  Its exactly the same with Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin has jumped 18,749,900% since 2010. It made sense to invest in it a few years ago. It was secure, unregulated and cryptocurrency seems like the future. But does it make sense to invest in it now?  Yes, Bitcoin has its pros. It's unregulated. Decentralized. Operates on Blockchain technology. But it's also unregulated(see what I did there?). Has no intrinsic value. And it's highly volatile.  Look, I might even be wrong. There are people that have forecasted the price of Bitcoin to hit 100,000$ a coin in ten years.  But I'm going to stay out of it. Warren Buffett has warned against it. Jamie Dimon has warned against it. Alan Greenspan compared it to gambling in Las Vegas.  If you must invest in it, remember the golden rule of investing - Never invest more than what you're willing to lose. If you absolutely must, no more than 10% of your portfolio must be invested in risky assets.  Like the famous economist Paul Samuelson once said, Investing should be like watching paint dry and watching grass grow. If you want excitement, take 100$ and go to Vegas.  EDIT: I seem to have gotten a lot of backlash for this answer. Guys, I understand were you all are coming from and I agree, 100%. Blockchain IS revolutionary. Cryptos are well designed to be the future of payments, and Blockchain is definitely not going away. But, this itself is not a reason to buy Bitcoin!  This has happened in the past as well with Airline industries and tech industries. Yes, some of them have done well, exceedingly well. But that's because they were good companies, with solid fundamentals and a good management team! It has nothing to do with the fact that they were the future.  This answer is ONLY about whether you should make an investment in Bitcoin or not. Blockchain is an exceedingly innovative and futuristic technology, no doubt about that.  I'm going to end this with a quote from Benjamin Graham, widely regarded as one of the best Investors of our time. Obvious prospects for physical growth in an industry do not translate into obvious prospects for investors.  EDIT 2: For all the haters in the comments:  This answer was first drafted when Bitcoin was at 14,000 USD a coin. The price of Bitcoin is now 6758 USD a coin.  Once again - Obvious prospects for physical growth in an industry do not translate into obvious prospects for investors.  Cheers.  EDIT 3: Almost one year after writing this answer:  The price of bitcoin is now 3704 USD a coin. It has fallen roughly 10,000 USD since this answer was written."}, {"upvote": 437, "content": "maybe you have a closer look to bitcoin/cryptos:  I am going to tell you the pros and cons of cryptocurrency, so you can efficiently decide whether to invest your money in them or not.

But so is gold.  Gold's value comes from its BRAND and scarcity. That brand has taken thousands of years to build.  However, the world is changing fast - one could argue that gold served a physical world well, we now live in a more digital one. The world does move on - I mean, horses were THE mode of transport for THOUSANDS of years - and that ended pretty abruptly.  Now, here's the thing, Bitcoin has gone past a hurdle most of us never thought it would - investment banks are advising their clients to buy it, institutions are buying it, HNW investors are dumping gold and going for it.  This is massive. This is BRAND.  Forget Bitcoin's intrinsic use, no-one ever cared about gold's either, but as more sophisticated investors buy into Bitcoin, which will spur on others, it will entrench itself as digital gold.  Bitcoin survived the crash of 2018, it'll keep surviving every crash for years to come, each time stronger, each time picking up investors that get comfortable with it. It's no currency and will unlikely ever become one, but it is digital gold - a digital store of wealth built on its BRAND, like most stores of wealth.

There is someone comparing bitcoin with Cisco, thinking that there is some kind of similarity between technology stocks and a decentralized, custodial asset which can proxy as a medium of exchange. Bitcoin is anti-technology if anything. It's the first of its kind, slower than any of the other coins that came after it, and isn't anywhere near as flashy in its ability to do anything. There are no claims. It simply is. Whereas technology companies frequently tell you that they will change the world only to fall on their face when they are told to turn a profit. Not only is it not a comparison, but it is revealing insight into the knowledge of an author\\u2014or lack thereof.  You can instantly tell who doesn't know anything they're talking about.  Bitcoin has been an investable asset because society does not know what or how to value; when society does know what to value, they tend to experience the loss of all of those years in not valuing the asset\\u2014in other words, the price of the asset begins to skyrocket over smaller increments of time.  Bitcoin has been valuable since its inception. For those in the Slush Pool in 2011 like myself, we were experimenting in something that was the first of its kind. A lot of us transacted in bitcoin because it was far more convenient and far more privacy-focused than anything else on the market.  Here is what inflated technology stocks that sell advertisement space on their platforms can do:  1. Dilute shareholders by selling additional stock at the peak (even if they haven't made a profit yet). I'm looking at Draft Kings, Shopify, and all the rest that have executives which pay themselves by creating additional shares and posting them out into markets. Bitcoin can't do that. Why? Only so many exist, you know how it is mined, there is an exact general ledger of what it is and what is happening. Nothing is a secret. There are no forms. The SEC won't be late to penalize someone for scamming. It is exactly what it is and will always be the same. No matter what. 2. Bitcoin is a database created by everyone. In many ways, it is the most elegant form of currency. It is trustless, yet people work together without actually consenting to working together or requiring someone else to do the right things. They are incentivized to do the right things. 3. Bitcoin is weightless. Go take pounds of gold somewhere to transact. 4. The price of an asset is the price that buyers are willing to pay for it. This is mathematics, but obviously grade school fails people here and there. It is a number that can be manipulated, but bitcoin is being adopted across the board. 5. It's a hedge against politicians and the federal reserve who can't be trusted. Every currency across history has failed. Nations make terrible choices and print more than the society can pay for later. We have printed over $5 trillion in dollars in 2020. The fed is telling you that things are going to be okay, but even they don't know what the hell they're doing. 0% rates, printing money against your income, and pumping the stock market. I'm sure things will end up okay. Meanwhile, bitcoin is completely deflationary. There are only so many, and it only gets harder to mine it. There are points I'm missing across the board.  My only advice is to take a microscope to the idiots who will provide you with a I read about bitcoin frequently; these are usually the people who know the least and haven't been a part of the bitcoin community whilst also spewing words that subtract any actual knowledge on the subject.  Look at any analyst's track record or look at the answers that came before; they've been wrong far more times, their position has been recycled at their company many times over, and they've been wrong by orders of magnitude that disqualify it as a simple accident."}, {"upvote": 40, "content": "The too late mindset will ruin your investing  psychology and your potential to make enough money to enjoy your life.  Bitcoin has gone mainstream. There are some people who hate me for it.  I'm getting quite a few people all asking me the same question: Is it too late to invest in bitcoin?  I don't think it is. Bitcoin is a paradigm shift in a world that is high on worthless currency printed in excess. The only way to fund our excessive lifestyles is to increase the global debt and pay for it with money printed out of thin air.  My approach to bitcoin is different. It's a little less drastic. I've been playing with it for years and have become fascinated by it. The rewards for me understanding bitcoin are now over 17,900%+ on the initial investment.  I don't think I've ever made another investment like it. It's likely I will never make another investment like it for the rest of my life. There may never be another investment like it.  The unfortunate psychological challenge when you buy something that performs beyond your wildest dreams is you think to yourself, I should have bought more. You can always want more and spend more. But it doesn't matter. Money has never made me happy. The same is likely true for you.  So how do you manage your psychology when bitcoin mania is sweeping the world and it has gone mainstream? How do you cope when it's trending on twitter, on the front page of every newspaper, being promoted by some of the biggest wall street tycoons in the world, like Paul Tudor Jones?  First, you stay calm.  You're never late to anything in life. You're right on time.  What bitcoin has done to date is irrelevant. If you haven't bought any or don't understand it then that's not the issue. The issue is whether you are openminded enough to rethink everything you know about money and investing. If you are, there is opportunity.  If your mind is closed, the world is closed, and so are the opportunities.  When I first heard about bitcoin , I thought it was a joke. I made fun of my work colleagues who were buying a sandwich with half a bitcoin and loving life.  Bitcoin is extremely weird  The trouble with bitcoin is it's not easy to understand. When people don't understand a concept they quickly dismiss it and call it a scam so they don't feel stupid.   * There are 21 million coins.  * You can't create more coins.  * The coins are digital.  * The coins are only safe if you take them off the internet  * Bitcoin is a way to store value. It's not currently used as a currency to transact with and may never fulfill that need.  * Bitcoin is a way to protect the value you create, with code humans can't manipulate to pay for a covid crisis or a recession.  * Bitcoin is a hedge. This means it's the opposite of everything else you can put your money into. Owning both sides of a marketplace de-risks you. If you only invest your money in one thing, then if that asset has a downturn and never recovers, you lose the lot.  * Bitcoin is an investment in an unknown, distant future. Like I said, bitcoin isn't normal. It confuses people and that's what it was designed to do.  The worst way to invest as an everyday person is for the short term. One of my early investments in bitcoin was short term. I bought a lot and then sold it when the price crashed in 2017. That short-term thinking has meant I'm working a few years longer than I need to.  I would be retired if I still had all the bitcoin I owned in 2017. I'm okay with that. My investor psychology was weak back then. I needed to see a few 50% drops to learn my lesson. The March 2020 covid crash was certainly a good test, and I passed without selling any bitcoin.  Thinking about the assets you invest in over the long term helps reduce your stress levels. You're less worried about whether it's too late or is now a good time and focused on doing your research and understanding what you're buying. This phrase sums it up better than I could.  It's not time to panic. It's time to digitally upgrade your financial education.  Physical cash in your wallet and nuggets of gold you take inside with a wheelbarrow is the pre-digital financial world. The world of money is a long way behind advances in technology.  Bitcoin is trying to catch the financial world up with the digital narrative, so we can use the phone in our pocket to go about our day and store our money without its value being secretly eroded away and taxed by inflation, by the pinstripe suit club.  If you've been thinking about bitcoin, do your research. Go down the rabbit hole. Avoid FOMO. Stay away from the hype. Understand the problem it solves, intimately. Get to know bitcoin like you would a new lover you invite into your bed to shag.  The best time to buy bitcoin is when you understand it and see its value."}]}, {"url": "https://www.quora.com/Is-bitcoin-worth-investing-in", "question": "Is bitcoin worth investing in", "answers": [{"upvote": 2190, "content": "Bitcoin is the beginning of something great: a currency without a government, something necessary and imperative.  https://t.me/+wv62vHY93zg4N2U0 "}, {"upvote": 1563, "content": "The demand for crypto trading has increased.

There are two guys, Hulk & Batman.  Batman wants to transfer 1,000 rupees to Hulk.  So, Batman goes to his bank in Gotham and transfers 1,000 rupees to Hulk's bank account in Ohio.  Now, the bank cashier will make a note of the transaction, either in a cash register or an online data sheet. He will give it a transaction number, and also note down the name of the two parties involved.  Understand the fact that whenever you transfer money, the bank is the third party which gets involved to note down the credentials of the transaction.  What if there was no bank required to make a transaction?  So, when Batman transfers money to Hulk through Bitcoins, all the information related to it is handled by a blockchain.  A block chain is a digital ledger in which transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are recorded chronologically and publicly.  It is a continuously growing list of records, which has the time stamps and transaction data.  Now, to maintain the block chain, or the list of records you need a network. A network of people who ensure the transactions are securely taking place and there is no disparity.  These people are our miners, who use their processing power to maintain security of block chains and to ensure that they keep working properly.  Miners are rewarded as well when they help maintain the block chain system.

Its balance is kept on a decentralized public ledger (also called blockchain), which can be accessed by everyone, thereby providing unprecedented transparency. A massive amount of computing power verifies all Bitcoin transactions.  * Bitcoin: What you can do with it? You can:  *   * Create or mine Bitcoin  * Distribute Bitcoin  * Trade Bitcoin  * Store Bitcoin   * What's so Special?  *   * Absolutely Decentralized: The most exciting thing about Bitcoin (denoted as BTC) is that unlike government-issued currencies it is not issued or backed by any government or bank.  * High Popularity Despite being Legal Tenders: Though they are not legal tenders, they are very high in popularity among investors. It is the increasing popularity of Bitcoin that led to the launch of around 5,000 other altcoins.  * Lower Transaction Fees: BTC promises to lower transaction fees than any other traditional online payment mechanism.   * Understanding Bitcoin in Simple Words Bitcoins are a collection of nodes (master nodes and simple nodes) that are nothing but computers. These computers run the code of Bitcoin and consequently store its blockchain.  Each blockchain is a collection of blocks. Each block, in turn, is a collection of transactions. The best thing about this system is its transparency, making it unlikely for anyone (including those who started it) to cheat the system.  All the computers that run the blockchain have the same block and transaction list. Everyone (whether they run a node or not) can see the new Bitcoin transactions occurring live and filling up the blocks one after the other. Cheating this system is unlikely.  Does that mean no one can cheat the Bitcoin System?  If a bad actor has to carry out a nefarious action, he/she has to operate 51% of the computing power that makes up the Bitcoin. As of May 2020, there are 47,000 nodes. Therefore, cheating this elaborate system is highly unlikely.  Now, suppose a bad actor carries out an attack. In such a case, the people who are running the nodes or the computers will most probably carry out a fork to a new blockchain. This will make the attack a wastage of time, resources, and effort of the bad actor.   * Should you invest in Bitcoin? Why? Absolutely. What are you waiting for? You should invest now because of the following reasons:   * Outstanding Prospect of Growth in 2021 Almost all analysts are predicting a bull run in 2021 as they are expecting the mass adoption of BTC in the near future.   * Nexo co-founder Antoni Trenchev has said that by 2021-end, the Bitcoin price is expected to rise to $50,000.  * A respected on-chain analyst has said that one of his economic models a 10-time price appreciation to around $200,000-to-$300,000 by 2021-end or early 2022.  * Many analysts believe that the next most logical target is the US$24,800 Fib level (just below US$25,000).  * Phenomenal Performance in 2020 Bitcoin price has increased by around 170% in 2020. If we consider the lows during the COVID-19 crash in March 2020, the bounceback is phenomenal. Since the lows of March, the BTC price against the US Dollar has increased by around 400%.   * JPMorgan Analysts believe BTC will Present Itself as an Alternative to Gold in terms of Store of Value A Bloomberg report says that the analysts of JPMorgan investment bank believe that BTC will continue to gain traction and may present a bear case for gold.  The adoption of bitcoin by institutional investors has only begun, while for gold its adoption by institutional investors is very advanced.  Billions of dollars worth of investment can potentially flow from gold to Bitcoin. Therefore, in the coming time, the gold may lose its shine as BTC's prospects brighten.   * 62% Market Capitalization On December 10, 2020, the market cap of Bitcoin was US$341,785,729,235, out of the total global market capitalization of US$546,541,275,989. BTC's market share is 62%, the highest in the cryptocurrency market. Its price movement largely defines the overall movement of the market.   * Big Players are Investing Heavily  *   * Big-time investors such as BlackRock's Rick Rieder, Paul Tudor Jones, Stanley Druckenmiller, and Bill Miller are parking more and more of their capital in Bitcoin and other altcoins.  * Payment companies such as PayPal and Square are continuing to funnel more retail capital into Bitcoin and other cryptos.   * Big Players are Buying at Lows Unlike 2017's bear run (when the BTC value tanked to 3,500-level), this time it'll be decent corrections. On December 9, 2020, the BTC/USD pair breached the US$18,000 level and moved downwards to US$17,640.56 and at one point in time exchange data showed buyer interest lined up at the US$16,200-level.  When asked about the prospects of the Bitcoin market, Cointelegraph Markets analyst Micha\\u00ebl van de Poppe and many others said that their overall estimate is positive because many big investors including Grayscale, Paypal, Square, MicroStrategy, and many others are buying at lower levels as the small crypto traders, shitcoiners, and weak hands sell-off.  They believe the downtrend will continue until the US$18,500-18,700 level is reclaimed. Currently, the BTC/USD price is revolving around US$18,022.35. So, time your entry by checking the technical charts and you'll most definitely reap the benefit in the coming year.   * Can I invest US$100 to buy Bitcoin? Yes, you can buy a portion of a single Bitcoin. However, always keep in mind that you've to give a certain commission for purchasing BTC. If you are paying US$10 for buying US$10,000 of Bitcoin, it means you are just paying 0.1% in fees. However, if you give US$10 fees for buying US$100 Bitcoin, you're 10% in fees.

Bitcoin is the first invented cryptocurrency. It dominates the crypto market (Bitcoin has more than 55% of the total money of the whole Crypto market).  So let's know on a deeper level.  What is Bitcoin?  Each Bitcoin is a computer file that is stored in a 'digital wallet' app on a smartphone or computer. People can send Bitcoins (or part of one) to your digital wallet, and you can send Bitcoins to other people. Every single transaction is recorded in a public list called the blockchain.  What is blockchain?  Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.  Nowadays apps are built on these Blockchain Platforms which makes them very very difficult to hack.  Why it is impossible to hack?  Because it works in Peer-to-Peer mode that means every single computer in the chain stores the data, so it's really impossible to change the data from every single computer in the chain.

What's the idea behind it?  The idea behind digital money was to create a way to exchange value with the help of the internet. Doing it, people would be able to send and receive money worldwide feeless and without the friction of any intermediaries.  At first, Bitcoin solved the trust problem. Apart from the fact that people can transact money directly over the internet with no intermediaries involved, they can also participate in developing the network trying to make it more secure. Thus, Satoshi disappeared being confident that the development of the network would continue.  One of the unique features of BTC is the absence of the leader, as all changes are made through consensus among all network participants. The Bitcoin ecosystem has a large open source developer community, who contribute research, peer review, testing, documentation, and translation. Moreover, according to Electric Capital research conducted in Dec, 2020, it is expanding, having 70%+ more developers than it did 3 years ago.  Though, Bitcoin has done a long way to its primary purpose.  At first, Bitcoin was traded for only a few cents and was mainly used for things like gambling.  In 2010, the first online crypto exchange Mt. Gox, was opened.  Later, Silk Road (a dark web marketplace for buying and selling drugs) stated using BTC as a method of payment.  With the increase of use, BTC's price hit $1 for the first time in spring 2011. It caught the attention of early investors and speculators.  New cryptocurrencies were created to compete with BTC or solve other problems. They were called altcoins, as alternatives to Bitcoin.  Though the FBI shut down the Silk Road in 2013, it showcased the promise of Bitcoin as a digital payment method.  In March 2014, Mt.Gox went bankrupt following a massive hack.  Despite the closure of the Silk Road and the collapse of Mt. Gox the crypto space kept expanding.  Now there are a lot of pro-crypto people and yet companies accepting Bitcoins, who believe that BTC can alter a global economy with digital money, changing it for the better.   How does Bitcoin work?  Since Bitcoin is decentralized, volunteers who are called \\\"miners\\\" constantly verify and update the blockchain. As soon as a specific amount of transactions are verified, another block is added to the blockchain.  BTC's system rewards successful miners with bitcoins. The reward changes over time, halving about every four years. The current reward for a new block of verified transactions is 6.25 BTC. By reducing the rewards of mining bitcoin, halving ensures that the amount of bitcoin in circulation does not increase exponentially, which also tends to put upward pressure on its price.  The algorithm works like this: you create a transaction =%3E it is added to the network and sent to miners =%3E they confirm it =%3E your funds have successfully been sent.  Is Bitcoin Legal?  Bitcoin ownership and mining are legal in more countries than not. Some examples of places where it is illegal are Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Bolivia, Ecuador, Nepal, and Pakistan.\\ufeff Overall, Bitcoin use and mining are legal across much of the globe.   How did it appear?  Since the code for Bitcoin may have been written in 2007, the first known sign of it came out in August 2008, when the domain name for \\\"http://bitcoin.org [ http://bitcoin.org/ ]\\\" was registered.  Bitcoin was introduced to the world by a person under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in October 2008 when he posted a paper  [ https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf ]titled \\\"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\\\" to the cryptography mailing list. The Bitcoin white paper is not only considered the most seminal piece of work in the cryptocurrency movement, it also gave birth to a transformative technology called blockchain.  \\ud83d\\udc46 It is interesting to know that he has never intended to invent a currency. In his announcement of Bitcoin in late 2008, Satoshi said that he developed \\\"A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\\\" only.  On 3rd Jan 2009, he mined the first block called \\\"Genesis\\\" with the text: \\\"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\\\"  It refers to a headline in The Times newspaper from the same date. It's possible that Nakamoto just picked the first headline he saw in the nearest paper. However, crypto enthusiasts tend to agree it's a statement of intent. The financial crisis of 2008 was still unraveling, and it's assumed that Bitcoin was a reaction to the widespread anger and frustration at the current financial system.  9th Jan 2009, Nakamoto announced Bitcoin version 0.1 in his \\\"White Paper\\\" to the cryptography mailing list.  12th Jan 2009: Nakamoto does the first Bitcoin transaction to Hal Finney, who was heavily involved in the community, advocating for the use of cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies.  In 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto officially stopped communicating. Between this period, the Bitcoins existing on the blockchain ledger, have not been used or spent. It proves how much Satoshi owns.  Having disappeared, Satoshi officially decentralized the network for good. Nakamoto created their last forum post on 12th December and continued occasionally responding to emails for a little longer, staying in touch with BTC developer Gavin Andresen until at least April.  Satoshi Nakamoto last message on the Bitcoin Forum  Nakamoto has not been involved in any of the changes since then.   Thanks for reading my answer!

It has some value. It can be exchanged for goods and services. It can be used to maintain a record of the cost of these goods and services. Earlier we had Gold and other metals as currency. It was later replaced by Paper currency. Now we have Credit Cards.  Whenever we give a bill or note (paper currency), the shopkeepers accepts it. They know that they can spend this money again to purchase from some one else. We carry this money in our wallets. We use it wherever we want too. We can use it in the middle of the night. The seller gets paid immediately.  Then came credit cards and digital payments. Now you are ranked based upon a score. Banks track your every transaction. They may or may not allow you to do a particular transaction. Credit card companies hold up shopkeeper's funds for months.  Some people decided to create a new form of currency i.e Bitcoin. It is supposed to work as cash i.e. paper currency. Any person can create a wallet. He can load his wallets with Bitcoins and spend at his will. You can purchase it via Dollars, Rupees, Pounds, Yen etc. There is fluctuation in the price of USD/INR, USD/GBP and others depending upon a countries growth, demand for their currency, their expenditure etc. Similarly, the price of Bitcoin fluctuates with its development, adoption, innovation, and usage.  Second thing Satoshi Nakamoto wanted was to create a system where no bank or government can control Bitcoin. He achieved by making it decentralised. He published the paper about Bitcoin and asked people to help him with development. Like other open source softwares, developers update Bitcoins. These developers do not work for any body. They write code because they believe Bitcoin can change the world. Hundreds of different developers around the world write and review Bitcoin code and make it more secure and easy for people to use.  Banks have their own centralised servers. They may maintain a copy of these servers in different places just to avoid any downtime. We have seen in past how these banks can be hacked and millions of Dollars are poured out of people's accounts. In Bitcoin, the server is maintained by thousands of computers around the globes. These computers are owned by people like us. Each of these computers have a copy of ledger. The ledger has records of all the transactions that happened with Bitcoin. If somebody needs to hack the Bitcoin, he will have to hack all these computers at once.  Now we have a system of unknown and unrelated people who want to transact with each other without the help of any third party. Someone needs to verify these transactions. There are miners which run huge servers for Bitcoin. The purpose of these servers is to verify each transaction and write it in the ledger. As this is an extensive process and requires a lot of computation power, miners get paid for verifying transactions.  There is no single person or group of persons who control the Bitcoins. There are many stakeholders. These are people like us. They want to see a new economic system in the world as they believe the current one is broken and outdated. These people do not know each other. They work because they believe in Bitcoins.  Legality of Bitcoin is a topic of debate. Many countries recognise Bitcoin but they have not yet declared it as a legal payment method. Japan now identifies Bitcoin as a legal tender. We have Bitcoin ATMs in US, Singapore, Canada and Europe. We have strict Bitcoin rules in China. India is still not decided on its stance on Bitcoin.  TLDR; Bitcoin is a digital cash. It works just like your online wallets. You can send money in your online wallet to your friends, buy stuff online and offline. It is completely online and works 24x7. Bitcoin was created by an anonymous person or group of persons known as Satoshi Nakamoto.

So its use is just like any currency - to make payments .  But how is it different from other currencies?  For that we might need to understand how a curreny works . So many many years ago traders accepted gold/precious metals etc in exchange for the services they provided . So a medium of exchange for services was gold (i.e. Money) .  But there was a problem .As they frequently travelled far across the states for business , keeping those heavy chunks of gold/metals etc was quite a tough task and posed problems (like carrying the gold,managing it etc) .  To solve the above problem , it was thought out that instead of carrying actual gold , traders would deposit their gold in a third party which they trusted and get from them a piece of paper declaring that the piece of paper was worth the amount of gold they had deposited (i.e. Currency) . So for the piece of paper to be of worth ,the parties involved in exchange needed to trust the third party (i.e. Bank). This was called the the \\u2018Gold Standard' where the piece of note actually meant that the same amount of gold was actually present in the bank and the parties could withdraw them from the bank using the paper .  So the value of the currency was the actual amount of gold inside the bank .Thats where the calue came from .  The Gold Standard was ended (meaning actual gold was not required) later and the currencies became fiat currency .Fiat currencies are the ones backed by the government of their resp countries and the value comes from the trust offered by the government .  The currencies however have a disadvantage that they can be regulated now and then by the Banks .eg. In India INR is regulated by RBI , similary for other currencies their resp countries central bank are responsible for the regulation .They can create new notes when and how they want (for various economic reasons).  Bitcoin is not regulated by any third party like bank , meaning it is decentralised(No third party has control over it) , Its a digital P2P - meaning Peer to Peer currency. This means every person in the world who has owned a bitcoin has a ledger (blockchain implementation) where he can verify the authenticity of every bitcoin and who were the owners previously(all transactions) . Digital meaning its created( or you say mining) by solving mathematical problems(basically hashes) on a computer that could consume electricity and more importantly time. There are a fixed no of bitcoins that can be mined (21 million) and already 16 million have been mined . But the process is such that the more you mine , the harder it is to mine the remaining . The estimate to mine last bitcoin is in 2140 . Yes thats true .  But where does the value of bitcoin comes from? - Its the trust of people on this currency and nothing else ."}, {"upvote": 4, "content": "The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the restrictions the West have placed on finance, commerce and banking systems in response to the Russian invasion, prompted media speculation about Bitcoin. Will the Russians use Bitcoin as a work around?    While that is a very complicated question involving global finance, geo-political tensions and war, I got a good answer from smart, young Thai woman with simple, but meaningful, insights into the developing world of crypto currencies.  The digital networks Bitcoin and other crypto currencies use are not capable of handling the volume of traffic required to replace the matrix of global finance systems. Blockchains - the digital networks crypto currencies operate on - have not developed sufficiently to provide the speed and volume necessary for the high the amount of transactions required for global money transfers.    In this essay I will attempt to explain what Bitcoin and other crypto currencies are in an easy to understand manner. I will also propose that the reason crypto currency networks have not developed into a fast, high volume system capable of moving money efficiently is because of equity speculation. Bitcoin billionaires have inadvertently prevented the development of what the creators of Bitcoin initially envisioned: a global digital currency devoid of a central authority.    If you wish to ride on a New York City subway, you might purchase a Metro Card.  Simply pay for your Metro Card at an electronic kiosk and the machine will transfer the value of your money and digitally encode the value onto the Metro Card. Your Metro Card now digitally stores the value of your money until you spend it by boarding a train. Metro Cards have limited use. You cannot buy a cup of coffee with a Metro Card. However, in Bangkok, Thailand where I live, the Rabbit Card, Bangkok's version of a Metro Card, can be used at a few merchants.  Bitcoin is similar to a Metro Card. An individual can purchase a Bitcoin (or a portion of a Bitcoin) and the value is noted on a digital network called a blockchain. Blockchains are unique in that they have solved a very difficult problem, how to prevent fraud and counterfeits. They do that basically with thousands of computers that monitor the blockchain. But unlike a Metro Card that has a fixed value, Bitcoin's value is determined by an open market. The pioneers of Bitcoin acquired Bitcoins for pennies. Many of those early adopters of Bitcoin became billionaires when the price of Bitcoin soared in open market exchanges. While the early conversation about Bitcoin was how it could replace traditional currency as a method of transferring value, that changed.  Investors began buying Bitcoin and the focus, the narrative, became all about the value of Bitcoin. Stories abounded about the billions of dollars early investors made by buying Bitcoin. Demand for Bitcoins increased motivating technically savvy entrepreneurs to set up online exchanges or brokers. First dozens, now hundreds of other crypto-coins or tokens emerged. With billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin and other coins changing hands by way of blockchain technology, government finance oversight entities became interested and created regulations governing blockchain transactions. The original idea of an anonymous transaction between two parties became an afterthought.    In 2017, I became aware of a surge in the price of Bitcoin in South Korea. Because of high local demand, eager South Korean speculators were paying 30% more for Bitcoin than in Bangkok where I live. When illogical price differences happen in a market, say the stock market, there is an opportunity for savvy traders to make a quick profit. Buy in the low market; sell in the high. It is a simple idea stock traders call arbitrage. At the time I knew little about Bitcoin. But this apparent arbitrage opportunity motivated me to learn about Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain network.    Simply put, blockchain is a large collection of computers that monitor the blockchain system and double check transactions on that system. Those computers compete to be the computer that verifies the transaction. The successful computer, and its human maintainer, get a commission from the transaction.  There are ways to buy Bitcoin from an individual. Crypto enthusiast call transactions between individuals peer to peer. A person can install an app on their smartphone. By scanning a QR code of another person's app, parties can transfer all or part of the value of a Bitcoin from one person to another, peer to peer. However, most holders of crypto currency I was meeting bought and sold their holdings through a central exchange such as Coinbase.     What you are actually buying is a digital notation on the blockchain. All you receive is an identifying number. Do not loose it.  The key to success in an arbitrage transaction is execution. Arbitrage traders in the stock market work in specialized environments where intrenched market players can sometimes execute quick trades to exploit a market imbalance. While I was reading stories on social media about people profiting by making arbitrage trades with Bitcoin in South Korea, I realized quickly that I did not have the network necessary to execute such trades.    Exchanges such as Coinbase have cross border limitations and high fees. While I knew people in Bangkok from whom I could have executed a peer to peer purchase, in Korea, I would have to seek them out. And while that may not have been too difficult given the hot market, it takes six hours to fly from Bangkok to Seoul.    The price of Bitcoin, then and now, is volatile. Thirty percent price swings are common. I could buy Bitcoin in Bangkok and when I got off the plane in Seoul, my investment may have dropped dramatically in value while I was enjoying my expensive plane ride. I opted out of a Bitcoin arbitrage scheme, but became very interested in blockchain concepts, ideas and technology.  Let me dispel one lingering myth about crypto-currency. Blockchain transactions are not untraceable or anonymous. The digital notations on the blockchain are public, a necessary element in the process of preventing duplicate transactions, fraud and counterfeits. These digital notations are identified by encrypted codes known only to the holders of the digital notations. But using AI data analysis and other surveillance, sophisticated parties can determine transaction sources when motivated to do so. If you want to purchase something and be truly untraceable and anonymous, use cash.  The volatility present in the crypto currency market is exacerbated by a feature first touted as a benefit of Bitcoin: there is a limited supply of Bitcoin, by design. The limit in supply theoretically prevents inflation. In the current volatile market of crypto currency, a construct such as inflation is not relevant. The value of goods and services rise, inflate, in relationship to a currency. A stable price has yet to be established from which its purchasing power would be deflated. If your crypto holdings go up and down dramatically, there is no logical way to determine an inflationary relationship with goods and services one might purchase with crypto.  When a big holder of Bitcoin sells one hundred million dollars of their holdings, that one transaction will affect the price. The market will go down. If a currency trader of US dollars sold one hundred million dollars worth of the US dollar for English pounds, the currency market - measured in hundreds of billions of dollars a day - would not even register the transaction. The lack of depth in the Bitcoin market, its limited supply, adds to the volatile price swings.  And here is where things get strange. The limited supply of Bitcoin, along with a cabal of early holders owning a significant proportion of the supply, creates an opportunity for market manipulation. Many of these early holders, called whales in the crypto orbit, accumulated large fortunes in the early rise of the value of Bitcoin. And they can easily make the market rise or fall by simply trading with themselves, a practice I have long suspected. Bloomberg News recently uncovered such an inside trade with a new blockchain product, non-fungible tokens, NFTs.  NFTs are digital art works now becoming a trendy new use of blockchain. An NFT held by the Trump organization recently sold for over one million dollars. Bloomberg's investigation showed the buyer was Melania Trump. The much heralded million dollar transaction falsely suggested there was a real market trading NFTs. While such a trade in US securities would be illegal, NFTs are not yet regulated. The Trump NFT transaction is legal. But it is also a clear indicator of how whales can manipulate the crypto market.  Bitcoin and other tokens have moved away from the original idea of a digital currency, or mechanism of exchange, to a simple store of value. Some early adopters are now paper billionaires. That kind of wealth is a magnet for others trying to get in on the new investment idea. Digital currencies, however, do not have any underlying value. The price of ownership of digital currencies has risen (and fallen) simply from demand. If the price dropped to zero, a distinct possibility according to many financiers such as Warren Buffet, holders of crypto currency would have nothing. By comparison, ownership of stocks means you have a share of a company. Even is the company went bankrupt, shareholders would get a share of the liquidation. Bonds have similar protections. While big looses are possible in stocks and bonds, holders of such instruments posses a portion of the tangible assets underlying those instruments. There are no tangible assets underlying crypto currency. Warren Buffett's partner, Charlie Munger, is very vocal about his objection to idea of crypto currency. He believes the current value of crypto currency is nothing more than a speculative bubble that is bound to pop.  In The Netherlands, in 1637 the price of forward contracts on tulip bulbs , a contract to buy or sell in the future, rose to a very high price. Exuberant demand created history's first recorded finance bubble. When the bubble popped, people holding the contracts went broke.  In 1929, a highly inflated stock market crashed in large part due to trading on margin. Margin trading is where stock holders borrow against their stock holdings. The bubble once again popped. Traders were jumping out windows.  In 2007, finance instruments called Credit Default Swaps (CDS) and Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDO) propped up global real estate markets. The value of CDOs and CDSs soared. Once again the bubble popped sending the world into the Great Recession.  Did these finance catastrophes cause traders to discontinue buying and selling the offending finance instruments?    Of course not!    Margin trading is currently huge. CDSs and CDOs trade in trillions of dollars, and forward contracts on commodities are common. Additionally, when the tulip contracts crashed, the holders still had pretty flowers. The question to ask about crypto currency is if and when the speculative mania now dominating digital currencies goes away, will there be any underlying value?  The answer is a firm yes. But the value will not be in tangible assets such as real estate, company shares or tulips. It is the blockchain network itself that very well may transform the global movement of money.  Mook is a smart twenty-two year old Thai woman I met at a Bitcoin Cash meetup in Bangkok last year. Bitcoin Cash is a digital currency spinoff of Bitcoin. Mook and a few other young people were approaching local Bangkok merchants, mostly bars, restaurants and hotels and encouraging the proprietors to accept Bitcoin Cash as payment method. Mook and her entourage of good looking young folks would show the prospective merchants the ease with which they could download an app onto their smart phone and right away begin transferring value to and from other Bitcoin Cash holders. A resurgence of COVID closed Thailand to tourists and put a stop to Mook's efforts. The ultimate users of Bitcoin Cash, Mook's target consumers, were tourists. There are not many Thais buying crypto currency.  Mook confirmed her friends' efforts promoting Bitcoin Cash were funded by Roger Ver, a Bitcoin Whale. Mook was quick to point out that she was not paid.  \\u2026I'm not funded by Roger. I know some people that got funded by him but I just do it on my own\\\", declared Mook.  Roger pivoted his focus away from Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash and is now the man behind the curtain pulling the levers of promotion for Bitcoin Cash. From my observation of Mook and her crew's efforts last year, the objective of this Roger Ver backed enterprise is indeed attempting to get Bitcoin Cash established as a usable currency in retail establishments. I am wondering though if there exist a natural tension between the holder of valuable equity and a functional crypto currency. They might be mutually exclusive states. If the market value of Bitcoin Cash drops dramatically and erodes a managing whale's fortune, would that not shift their efforts toward maintaining their fortune?  A year has passed since Mook and her Bitcoin Cash crew were promoting the use of crypto currency in Thai retail businesses. I had a long, pleasant conversation over coffee with Mook about her perspective on the use of crypto currency going forward. With impressive insight into finance realities, Mook wrapped up our conversation saying that she, and other middle class Thais, would never buy crypto currency as an investment. It is too volatile and risky. But Mook would use crypto currency as money if a fast, reliable network becomes available.  Another businessman I know well here in Bangkok has been working on developing cross border micro-payment systems using blockchain since 2014. This gentleman, let's call him Stan, worked at high levels in the crypto-currency world until recently when he formed his own company. Stan was frustrated with how holders of crypto currency focused their attention on maintaining equity rather than developing payment networks. Now on his own with a few partners, Stan hopes to maintain that focus, getting the blockchain developed as a usable network rather than a speculation device. When I asked Stan if he thought the turmoil in the movement of money caused by the Ukraine crisis might be an interruption to the status quo that might change the path of blockchain development, Stan shrugged.

Bitcoin, often described as a cryptocurrency, a virtual currency or a digital currency - is a type of money that is completely virtual.  It's like an online version of cash. You can use it to buy products and services, but not many shops accept Bitcoin yet and some countries have banned it altogether.  However, some companies are beginning to buy into its growing influence.  For example, the online payment service, PayPal, announced that it would be allowing its customers to buy and sell Bitcoin.  The physical Bitcoins you see in photos are a novelty. They would be worthless without the private codes printed inside them.  How does Bitcoin work?  Each Bitcoin is basically a computer file which is stored in a 'digital wallet' app on a smartphone or computer.  People can send Bitcoins (or part of one) to your digital wallet, and you can send Bitcoins to other people.  Every single transaction is recorded in a public list called the blockchain.  This makes it possible to trace the history of Bitcoins to stop people from spending coins they do not own, making copies or undo-ing transactions.  How do people get Bitcoins?  There are three main ways people get Bitcoins.   * You can buy Bitcoins using 'real' money.  * You can sell things and let people pay you with Bitcoins.  * Or they can be created using a computer.

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.  HERE is some more information about Bitcoin on Wikipedia [ https://www.google.ae/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwibjJ-D4Yj3AhUGDOwKHRL5BT0QmhN6BAhREAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBitcoin&usg=AOvVaw0r9_9CkqY7pxTso7fxqOJQ ]"}, {"upvote": 204, "content": "It is the first Decentralized currency  I know what you are thinking. And that is : If I hear the words Decentralized currency one more time, I am gonna personally find Satoshi Nakamoto and decentralize him.  Right, so let's see what Decentralized currency means later. For now, let's see what is Currency.  Currency is a tool which we use to exchange values. Earlier people were using Gold and other valuable metals to exchange with goods required by them. Gold was tangible. If a certain amount of Gold were to be in your hand, it basically meant you owned it.  Due to Gold's obvious disadvantages, we started using paper money. What we currently are acquainted with is something called Fiat Currency. Which means we are basically assuming that a particular piece of paper is worth some value.  *I promise to pay the bearer(of this note) the sum of one hundred rupees*  Nowadays most of the money is just in the form of numbers. So there is a possibility that the same money can be used for multiple transactions. This problem is called as Double Spending.  To avoid this, banks keep a ledger to keep track of all the transactions essentially acting as a Centre. Hence our conventional money is called as Centralized Currency.  Some computer scientists were not satisfied with a third party(bank) keeping track of transactions. This is when Satoshi Nakamoto comes in and proposes and entirely different solution where there is no 3rd party involved(decentralized currency). BITCOIN  Decentralized currency is like Internet. There is no one entity owning it(yet).  The deal with Bitcoin is that all the transactions are public and the ledger recording those transactions are public. This ledger is called as a BLOCKCHAIN. Everyone can have a copy of it and tally their transactions.  There might be issues regarding security but think of hacking a bitcoin blockchain as hacking english dictionary. You can change the meaning of a word in one dictionary. But not in every other copy in the world.  If you are still reading, I will add more content on it in future."}, {"upvote": 1158, "content": "Bitcoin is digital money that you can transfer to another person without the need of a third party, like a bank. It can be thought of as a digital equivalent of cash - it's just one person transferring value to another person, no bank involved. In fact, Bitcoins are not issued by a bank or government, so an even more apt analogy than cash might therefore be gold.  Ok, digital gold, got it. Weird. Why are people excited?  1. Get rid of transaction costs  UPDATE 2018\\u201301\\u201303: Bitcoin, due to various technical and political reasons, now has tremendously high transaction costs, several dollars per transaction. Bitcoins main competitor, Etherium [ https://www.ethereum.org/ ], is slightly better in this regard, but I'm personally banking on Stellar [ https://www.stellar.org/ ] which has very low transaction costs and is getting a lot of attention in recent months.  Because there is no central authority controlling the network, transactions costs are incredibly low compared to existing systems. Banks, card issuers and payment processors places a 1-5% transaction fee on that coffee you bought this morning, and everything else you buy. This is not very visible in everyday life, because it's almost always baked into the price of things, but if you start transferring money internationally with companies like Western Union, you realise that there is quite a bit of money in the business of transferring money.  2. Take currency power away from banks and government  Banks and government have the legal and physical ability to create money. I won't get into the details (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_creation) of how that works, but the main problem is that whenever money is created, it dilutes the value of everyone's money, which makes it a super-fast, completely silent, taxation.  Sometimes, governments and banks use this power responsibly, but sometimes, they do not. Lately, there has been a lot of the latter, with the Financial crisis of 2007\\u201308 [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late-2000s_financial_crisis ] caused by irresponsible lending, so a lot of people are starting to think that we probably are more reliant on banks and government that we want to be. An even more current example is Argentina, which has a 11% inflation (!) on its currency. Bitcoin is getting a strong hold there: BitPagos Uses Merchant Processing To Bring Bitcoin To Argentina [ http://thegenesisblock.com/bitpagos-uses-merchant-processing-bring-bitcoin-argentina/ ]  How does it work?  Before I go on, I'd like to point out that you probably don't know how your normal money works. Most people have no idea how money is transferred from one bank to another, or how it's created in the first place.  With that said, all Bitcoin transactions, from the beginning of time, are written down in an enormous, public ledger. When you transfer money from your Bitcoin wallet to another person, you do that by writing this transaction down in the public ledger. Everyone is watching this ledger and has their own copies of it, and so they now know that there is less money in your wallet, and more money in a friend's wallet. So everyone knows how much money each wallet contains. This is where your money is stored, in this public ledger with millions of copies that everyone maintains together. They do, however, not know who owns that wallet - Bitcoin has no notion of identity.  So what's preventing another person from transferring money from my wallet to their own?  This is where cryptography comes in. When your Bitcoin wallet is generated, it's given to you in two parts. One public part, an address, that you give to other people so that they know where to send you money, and a secret part, a key.  The key is used to \\\"sign\\\" transactions. It takes the amount, the sender address, receiver address, and the key, jumbles it together with math, and out comes a signature, that you put in the ledger along with the transactions. Due to how cryptography works, other people can mathematically verify that the person that generated this signature for this transaction must indeed have the key for this wallet. They can, however, not work backwards to what the key actually is - that would take a supercomputer thousands of years to do.   Shameless plug: If you like my ramblings about programming on Quora, you might enjoy my YouTube show: Fun Fun Function [ https://youtube.com/funfunfunction ]"}, {"upvote": 24, "content": "Since this is a four-part question, let me consider each question individually and give you four answers.  1. What is Bitcoin?  Bitcoin is the first and the most popular cryptocurrency introduced to humankind. It is a peer-to-peer digital cash system. And it helps you send and receive money over the internet securely and at a fraction of cost compared to the traditional banking channel.  2. How does Bitcoin work?  A Bitcoin is simply like a computer file stored in a 'digital wallet' app on a smartphone or computer.  You can send Bitcoins (or part of one) to a digital wallet. Every single transaction is recorded in a public list called the blockchain. That makes it possible to trace the history of Bitcoins to stop people from spending coins they do not own, making copies or undo-ing transactions.  Bitcoins are designed in such a way that there will ever be only 21 million BTC in total. It is rare and scarce and can be used both as a means of exchange and a store of value.  3. Is it Legal?   %3E No law in India makes mining, buying, selling, trading bitcoins, or alike cryptocurrencies illegal. In 2018, the RBI did impose a ban on banks and other financial institutions from servicing any crypto transaction. However, the ban never specified that trading in Bitcoin was illegal - meaning, you could still transact in Bitcoins peer to peer.  After nearly two years of battle, India's crypto-community won its battle against RBI's circular banning regulated financial institutions, from offering services to crypto-related businesses.  In March 2020, the Supreme Court of India passed a judgment holding RBI's circular unconstitutional.  So, now investing is not only legal but also banks are now free to facilitate any transaction relating to crypto.  4. Who is behind it?  Well, Bitcoin first appeared in a white paper under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi's identity remains unknown till today; we do not know if it is a he, she or they.  At present, Bitcoin is owned by the community as a whole. Since it is an open-source initiative, with no single owner behind it, we can say it is a part of the Bitcoin community.

It can be thought of as a digital equivalent of cash"}, {"upvote": 31, "content": "What is Bitcoin?   * It is virtual money  * It is a means of payment  * It is a good store of value  * It is only usable via technological devices and the internet  * It is already acceptable by Virgin, Microsoft and soon by Starbucks In simplest terms, bitcoin is a currency just like the dollar, the Euro, and other traditional currencies. It can be used to buy goods and services, hold value, and do many other things a currency typically does.  However, Bitcoin has no physical existence; it only has a digital existence. There are stark differences between bitcoin and other currencies. For instance, it lacks a central regulatory authority such as a central bank. Such radical issues initially made the currency get a lot of legal and political opposition in its first years of existence after it was introduced in 2009.  There are riveting benefits to this virtual currency such as greater transactional security, faster payments, and lower transaction costs have made its relevance in the modern financial world more apparent. This is why many countries now recognize the new-age currency and the groundbreaking technology on which it is based.  How does It Work?  There is a bit of confusion as to how bitcoin works. The process is quite simple.  First of all, you should have a bitcoin wallet installed on your computer or mobile device so that you can have a Bitcoin address. You are free to have all the addresses you want. Anyway, with this address, you can make payments and receive payments in form of bitcoin.  It is more like email, but you get and send payments, not messages. The wallets also have a private key, also called a seed. This private key is used to sign the transactions in order to verify them as having originated from that particular wallet.  Therefore, the transactions cannot be modified by anyone. These transactions are confirmed by computers in the network through a process called mining, and they are made part of the public ledger by being added to the blockchain.  The blockchain is a public ledger that details all the transactions that take place within the network. This system verifies all transactions independent of any single party, therefore ensuring security and transparency. This system is protected using cryptography.  Is It Legal?  The answer to this question can be yes, no or undefined; depending on the country or region you are talking about.  In some countries, Bitcoin exists in a legal gray area, where it is neither legal or illegal. In others, there are laws that clearly give cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin a legal standing, allowing its use for commerce within the country.  Whereas, in other countries, there are laws that clearly outlaw the use of this and other virtual currency. For instance, Bitcoin is legal in the USA and European Union as it is recognized as a currency. It is even subject to taxes that other currencies are subjected to when used in trade. The G7 has also given Bitcoin a legal status, although this comes with concerns that the currency may pose risks that regular currencies might not give their users.  At the same time, there are countries that have made laws that have made an absolute ban on the use of Bitcoin. Examples include Egypt, Bolivia, Saudi Arabia and others. In some countries, the ban is issued with regard to the use of this currency within the banking system, although it is legal for other financial situations.  These countries include Jordan, India, Thailand and others. In a country like Vietnam, it is legal to hold and trade in Bitcoin, but it is illegal to use it as a payment tool.  In other countries, Bitcoin is neither legal or illegal, and people use it without the risk of any legal consequences because there are no laws limiting or regulating its use. However, generally speaking, Bitcoin is legal in a majority of countries; and the number of countries that are lifting bans on its use continues to grow as the technology gains more acceptance in the mainstream financial world.  Who Runs It?  Nobody runs bitcoin; or more accurately, all its have a say in how it operates. This is different from the way regular currencies are operated. With regular currencies, value, inflation, supply and so forth is often dictated by a central authority.  Bitcoin, computers around the world work together to create bitcoins, with the ultimate number of coins that will constitute the bitcoin network set at 21 million. Its value is also determined by the laws of supply and demand.  How Can You Participate in It?  Being a bitcoin user or trader is very easy. You can join a broker that offers bitcoin trading, open an account and fund it with fiat currency and then use these funds to trade bitcoin. Similarly, you can open a bitcoin wallet, put money in it using regular currency and then use this currency to buy bitcoins and hold it in your wallet.  The other option is using a cryptocurrency exchange, which can give you bitcoins in exchange for regular currency. You can then withdraw this money into your cryptocurrency wallet, where bitcoin and other virtual currencies can be held and used to trade, make payments and do everything else that pertains to the use of a currency.  Can You Make Money with Bitcoin?  Yes, you can make money with Bitcoin, but this is highly subjective. If you know how to trade in currencies, then you can trade in bitcoin at various exchanges and make money as currency values around the world rise and fall.  You can also speculate on bitcoin's future value and buy or sell units of the currency with the hope of making a profit in future when the trend you expected happens.  However, just as with other financial assets, attempts to make a profit using Bitcoin come with risks of loss. So, make sure you know what you are doing as you try to make money through this virtual currency for you to actually turn a profit.  How Bitcoin (BTC), Cryptocurrency and Blockchain will Change Our Lives  The future of finance is believed to belong to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Banking institutions are already starting to embrace the blockchain technology on which these currencies are based as they offer a greater level of security during transactions. People will also take up the use of bitcoin more readily as it offers safer, faster, and a more globally accepted way of making and receiving payments in comparison to the traditional currencies.  As we speak, there are countries where residents are turning to bitcoin due to the instabilities the local currency offers due to political or economic issues facing them.  An example is Venezuela. This trend is likely to grow in future as bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies exceed traditional currencies in acceptability around the world. Other sectors will change because of BTC and the blockchain technology as well. For instance, cloud storage services can use the encryption technology that blockchain systems use to ensure that data does not suffer any unauthorized modifications or access.  Even with regard to Internet of Things (IoT), bitcoin and its seminal blockchain technology has something to offer in future. Currently, this system works with a centralized technology, which is susceptible to hacks and other security issues. However, by being decentralized and encrypted like blockchain technology, it will be much safer for everybody.  So yes, bitcoin and blockchain technology will change the future in a big way.

Note: This is not in any case of me trying to lure you into anything for my own personal financial gain, i am just innocently sharing with you what works for me. You can also make a research on what works for you too.  With all that preamble over, let's dive into the steps involved in a smart bitcoin investment.  Step 1: Choose a Crypto Exchange or Platform  Your first step of course will be to choose where to buy your crypto.  Like USD, bitcoin is the same no matter where you withdraw it from. Therefore, your primary considerations will be safety, convenience and fees.  We've published a whole story on the best crypto exchanges, but to help narrow your search, here are my top three picks for beginners.  For Most Beginners: Coinbase   * Pros: Extremely user-friendly; a publicly traded company; earn free crypto with Coinbase Learn.  * Cons: High trading fees; can't control wallet keys. Coinbase is a household name for crypto buying for a reason. It's not only the first crypto exchange to go public; it's also the softest landing pad for crypto beginners.  Coinbase knows that crypto investing can be a little intimidating, so it designed its buying process to be as streamlined as possible. You pretty much just sign up, attach a payment method and \\u2014 boom \\u2014 buy crypto like it's Amazon.  Plus you can earn free crypto by watching short training videos on Coinbase Learn.  Coinbase's Learn and Earn  The chief drawback to Coinbase is that it charges higher-than-average fees: up to $2.99 per transaction plus a spread fee of around 0.50% between purchase and sale prices.  But due to convenience, safety and customer service, many traders stick with Coinbase for the long haul.  Step 2: Connect Your Bank Account to the Exchange  Step 2 is pretty straightforward \\u2014 at some point, your chosen crypto exchange is going to ask you to connect a bank account as your primary payment method. Hand 'em your bank account and routing numbers and you're good to go.  As simple as it is, Step 2 does raise a common question:  Can I Buy Crypto With a Credit Card?  In most cases, no. In fact, Coinbase, like most crypto exchanges, won't even let you add a credit card.  Here's why: Most banks treat crypto purchases like cash advances. Therefore, your bank will immediately charge you a cash-advance fee of 3% to 5% of the purchase amount. It also won't give you a grace period, meaning you'll accumulate high interest on your crypto purchase immediately. Heck, if the exchange isn't U.S. based, it'll even charge you a foreign transaction fee on top of everything else, just for good measure.  But banks don't mind wiring the money from your bank account to the exchange. The reason is simple: That's your money, not theirs.  So if you were hoping that your bitcoin investment would earn you some rewards points on the side, sorry to burst your bubble.  Step 3: Place an Order  Now that you've registered for an account and attached your bank account, it's finally time to buy some bitcoin!  On most exchanges, you're never more than a click or two away from buying bitcoin. Click the big Buy/Sell button and you'll be brought to a page like this one from Coinbase:  Coinbase's Buy Window  Next question: How much should you buy?  Well, this article is more of a how to than a how much. But since we're here, I will say this to help you come up with an initial purchase amount:  1. Re-familiarize yourself with the Before Investing section above. 2. Determine your risk tolerance. 3. Speak to your wealth advisor (or consider getting one) to determine how much of your portfolio you should dedicate to very-high-risk investments. 4. Start small \\u2014 Put in a small fraction of a paycheck and watch how it performs over time. 5. Finally, don't worry about purchasing round numbers (like 1 BTC for $50,000) since exchanges support partial coins. If you're getting cold feet, remember that you can always earn free crypto, risk free, through Coinbase Learn or from bitcoin mining."}, {"upvote": 40, "content": "How to Get Bitcoins Fast  1. Buy Bitcoins Online  To buy or earn free bitcoins, you first need to download a bitcoin wallet, which is software that allows you to securely send, receive, and store funds in the bitcoin network. There are four types of bitcoin wallets that you can use: mobile, web, desktop, and hardware.  Once you download a wallet, you need to set up an account on a cryptocurrency exchange that's approved by your wallet provider. Cryptocurrency exchanges are market places where sellers trade cryptocurrencies to buyers in exchange for fiat money or other digital currencies.  Most exchanges accept bank transfer or credit card payments, and some even accept Paypal payments. They'll also charge you a transaction fee for every trade you make. You can choose from hundreds of crypto exchanges, but the most popular and reputable exchanges are Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Coinbase, and Coinmama.  2. Buy Bitcoins in Person  If you'd rather buy bitcoins in person, you have four options to choose from:   * Use websites like Coin ATM Radar [ https://coinatmradar.com/ ] to help you find a Bitcoin ATM, which works very similarly to a regular ATM, except you trade your cash for bitcoin.  * Use websites like LibertyX [ https://libertyx.com/ ] to find retail stores across the United States that will give you bitcoin in exchange for cash.  * Use websites like Paxful [ https://paxful.com/ ] to find bank branches that will give you bitcoin in exchange for cash deposits.  * Use websites like LocalBitcoins [ https://localbitcoins.com/ ] to find people who are willing to exchange Bitcoin for cash, in person.

An exchange is a pretty quick way to obtain bitcoins as long as you are comfortable with the process. For instance, you will need a means of payment, because you are online and can't use cash. Trading platforms allow customers to purchase cryptocurrencies in their local currency and you can usually pay using a credit card, Paypal, and bank wire depending on the exchange in question.  Exchanges will also require identification and will want to verify your identity in some fashion. The trading platform may require a picture ID or some proof of residence. Two things you will typically have to wait for before actually purchasing coins on an exchange is a verified identity and a validated payment system. Once those are in order, the platform will let you purchase cryptocurrencies and from there you can send them to your noncustodial wallet.

I run a small mine as an educational hobby in my garage. Using equipment purchased in 2014, I am currently running at 6,106 GH/s. This means on average I mine 0.04952418 BTC per day, using 5,442 watts of power. My marginal electricity cost is USD $0.1139 per kWh, so at the current (at the moment) bitcoin price of $380.99, I am making a profit of $3.99 per day. The reason I call it an educational hobby, however, is that the total return on the project since September, 2013, is -27.2 percent if I turned everything into dollars today. I keep the bitcoin I mine in bitcoin, because only an increase in the value of bitcoin could make the project profitable overall. My expenses so far are 72% equipment and 28% electricity, but of course that puts no value on the (large) amount of time I spent working on this. I've learned an amazing amount about bitcoin in the process, so I consider it a win either way.  Now that you can invest hugely on Power-Miner Startup Lab (www.power-miner.store) where you can get daily profit off your bitcoin investments for as long as 6 months through mining and daily trading, then life is getting better for Bitcoin investors now. Thanks to the world cryptocurrency leaders for bringing in other options of earning cryptocurrency  Update December 29, 2015: Bitcoin mining difficulty has increased significantly, the worldwide network is now making 786 quadrillion mining guesses per second. I am now mining 0.03299220 BTC per day, my marginal electricity cost has risen to USD $0.1152 per kWh, and at the current bitcoin price of USD $430.73, I am currently overpaying for the bitcoins I mine to the tune of USD $0.85 per day. My mine uses USD $455.56 worth of electricity to mine one bitcoin. On the other hand, the garage keeps the rest of the house warm in winter, so it's roughly a break-even operation for the time being. The overall operation would be -16.8 percent if I turned everything into dollars today, expenses so far are 70% equipment and 30% electricity. If bitcoin prices rise to USD $518 then I'm in the black.  Update January 10, 2016: Rising bitcoin mining difficulty is taking its toll. Mining 0.02967912 BTC per day, but it costs USD $15.08 in electricity per day to operate the mine, so my effective BTC cost is USD $508.10. With the current market price of BTC at USD $440, it doesn't make sense to run much longer unless bitcoin prices rise. The whole project is -14.9% if I stopped right now and turned everything back into USD. The upside is that my hobby has returned 85.1% of its costs. Adding some pictures of the effort.  Update June 11, 2016: Current mining operation is running at a loss, but whole project is now 11.6% in the black.

If you have money, you can expect every store to accept it at par value (if it says $1, it is worth $1 in exchange for goods). Bit coins are not good for debts. You can not use them to pay off the government. The government will not give them to you. You can have 1000 bitcoins in your wallet and go to Ralph's Grocery store and it won't buy you a single Twinkie. You can ask your boss to pay you in Bit Coins, and they won't.

As a starting point, it's important to remember that the same intuitive rules that apply to traditional money also applies to Bitcoin. For example, don't store cash under your mattress else it might get stolen, or don't trust your money with strangers.  Bitcoin also has some fairly unique risks: for one, it's a brand new technology, and while it appears very secure and robust, there is always a chance that it might fail. That is also a reason why you should never put \\u2018all your eggs in one basket' and never buy more Bitcoin than you can afford to lose. Bitcoin is also more volatile (i.e. it can move a lot in value both up or down in a short space of time) than many other currencies, and while this appears to be stabilising over time, it's sure to experience many highly volatile moments in the future.  With the startup cryptocurrency investment company like cryptosbinary Investment Limited (www.cryptosbinary, com) where you get 40%ROI of your invested cryptocurrency after 7 days. To help simplify this tedious process, we made a breakdown of some of the most promising cryptocurrency tokens/coins that are most likely to birth highly attractive profits for both traders and investors.  Also remember that Bitcoin transactions are like cash in that they are irreversible - so if you send Bitcoin to the wrong person, or your Bitcoin wallet is compromised and someone steals your Bitcoin, it might be very difficult if not impossible to get it back. Bitcoin is also not backed by any entity, so if you lose your Bitcoin, your service provider or \\u2018the Bitcoin network' will not be able to reimburse your funds. That's why you need to ensure you use highly trusted product or service providers to help you, similar to how you would ask a bank to help you safely store your money.  Lastly, Bitcoin's value is determined by the amount of people or business that are willing to accept it, and this is by no means guaranteed. If it grows it will be very good for Bitcoin, but if less people want to use Bitcoin, it will have a very negative impact on the price and might lead to Bitcoin not being used at all.

The only difference is that the price of Bitcoin changes on a much greater scale than local currencies.  Bitcoin's price has crashed many times over the years:   * In 2011, the price crashed 93% in five months;  * From November 2014 to January 2015, Bitcoin's value was halved, much like its crash in December 2017. Will Bitcoin Crash Again?  If more countries create regulations/laws for cryptocurrency, more bad news will be published. This means we may see Bitcoin crashing again. Countries such as South Korea, Japan, China, France, and the United States all want to create new regulations.  Even though they want to create new regulations, we must remember that:  1. This could take a long time. 2. It might not affect the price of Bitcoin. Until then, the most popular Bitcoin projection is that it will continue to rise.

It's digital, secure, universal, has a strong brand, limited in supply, outside the control of governments.\\\"  However, a realisation does seem to be bursting this, and I believe this is the underlying reason why Bitcoin is falling.  Bitcoin alternatives. The crypto universe is fast becoming a messy space with plenty of alternative credible cryptos emerging. While gold was the default store of value for millennia, I don't think Bitcoin can keep its position as the default crypto for long.  Bitcoin's technology is ageing and replicable, its value lies in its brand - the fact that many institutional investors have accepted it, the fact that people talk about it, the fact that it's the default digital alternative to gold.  Its status as this default is at serious risk. But without it Bitcoin is nothing.

The surge and volatility of bitcoin this year may be great for those who invested early, but it undermines bitcoin's viability as a currency.  Firstly I will recommend Allcoinhodler Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www.allcoinhodler,com) as it is relatively new (launched at mid-summer 2017) but has become the largest cryptocurrency Investment Platform there is right now (total volume over 4 billion dollars) where you get double of your invested cryptocurrency after 7 days. Supports variety of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. I find that it has a really nice UI and support.  Right now, I can use my bitcoin holdings to pay for purchases at Overstock (OSTBP), or book a hotel on Expedia (EXPE). But if I use bitcoin to buy $25 worth of socks on Overstock today, and the price of bitcoin quadruples next week, I'll feel like those socks actually cost me $100. Then again, if bitcoin crashes, at least I'll always have the socks.  Rather than a currency, bitcoin is being treated more like an asset, with the hope of reaping great returns in the future.  So is there anything truly valuable about bitcoin?  Yes, the technology behind it.  Bitcoin is built on the blockchain, a public ledger containing all the transaction data from anyone who uses bitcoin. Transactions are added to \\\"blocks\\\" or the links of code that make up the chain, and each transaction must be recorded on a block.  Even bitcoin critics like Dimon have said they support the use of blockchain technology for tracking payments.  Is there a legal and legitimate way to invest in bitcoin?  Bitcoin exchanges have a checkered history. Mt.Gox, once the largest exchange, shut down in 2014 after losing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin after a hack.  Today, the leading exchange is offered by Coinbase, a startup that has raised more than $200 million from a number of top tier venture capital firms. Square (SQ), the payments service, is also rolling out a bitcoin product.  There are also bitcoin ATMs in scattered bodegas and convenience stores around the country, through companies like Coinsource. The ATMs let you exchange bitcoin for cash, or vice versa by scanning a QR code from the digital wallet application on your phone.  With Coinbase, you must first give the app permission to connect to your bank account. As with other stock trading applications, you pay a small fee for each transaction, buying and selling. But the transaction can take significantly longer.  My original $100 bitcoin purchase won't officially be completed on Coinbase until Friday, more than a week after the transaction. The price I bought it at remains the same, but I won't be able to sell at the earliest until Friday."}, {"upvote": 1732, "content": "It is self evident that the global financial markets are in turmoil due to the following reasons:  Before i continue, Incase you are worried about what all these cryptocurrencies are heading to, DON'T GIVE UP!!!

For example, Bitcoin reserves are currently at their lowest on the exchange platforms and therefore on the spot market, but since there is not enough demand on the spot market, the price continues to fall.

If you want to learn how to earn money from Bitcoin, this step-by-step guide will give you everything you need to know, whether you're brand new to Bitcoin or an experienced user looking to make more money. Start earning today!  What is cryptocurrency?  Cryptocurrency is digital currency that is not backed by any central bank. It's decentralized, meaning no one person controls it. It uses cryptography to secure transactions and control the creation of new units of currency. Cryptocurrencies can be used to purchase goods and services, but they are also traded on exchanges like stocks. The price of cryptocurrency varies with supply and demand. The more people who want to buy or sell at any given time, the higher its price will go. If there aren't enough buyers at a certain price level, sellers might lower their asking prices to unload coins quicker. Bitcoin was the first type of cryptocurrency created in 2009 by an unknown programmer named Satoshi Nakamoto. As opposed to traditional currencies such as the U.S. dollar or euro, bitcoin doesn't have a centralized governing body such as a country's central bank regulating it. Bitcoins are created as payments for validating transactions for those using other forms of cryptocurrency.  Investing in cryptocurrency  The process of investing in cryptocurrency can be overwhelming at first, but it's not too hard to get started. You'll need to start by setting up an account on Coinbase. Once you have a Coinbase account, you can transfer funds from your bank account and buy bitcoin (BTC). Next, send the bitcoin to your personal wallet (e.g. myetherwallet) and store it there until you're ready to use it for investment purposes or trade with another party.  1. Register on Coinbase  2. Transfer funds  3. Buy BTC  4. Send BTC to personal wallet  5. Keep funds stored in personal wallet  6. Trade BTC 7. When you want to trade bitcoin, log back into Coinbase  8. Select Accounts and then Send  9. Select Bitcoin  10. Enter the recipient address  11. Enter the amount  12. Verify everything is correct  13. Select Pay  14. Review  15. A confirmation email will be sent to both parties 16. After about one hour, the bitcoin will show as confirmed in both wallets . At this point, the sender has successfully transferred ownership of their bitcoin to the receiver. Now that you know how to purchase Bitcoin, let's talk about how to invest with them! To invest in cryptocurrencies, you'll need a digital wallet and some spare cash. I recommend buying some Ethereum and keeping it secure in your digital wallet until there are good investment opportunities (e.g., when prices are low). If you have any questions about anything we've discussed here please feel free to contact us!  Earning free cryptocurrency  Bitcoin is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in use, and it allows you to earn cryptocurrency without investing in it. The easiest way to do so is by joining an online service called CoinPot. CoinPot includes over 40 different coins, including Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), and Dogecoin (DOGE). All you have to do is sign up for an account with them, and then they will give you 10% of whatever coins you mine! That means that if you mine 100 DOGE, CoinPot will credit your account with 10 DOGE. It's as easy as that! Another option would be to invest in bitcoin mining equipment such as ASIC miners or cloud mining contracts through companies like Hashflare or Genesis Mining. These provide more than just bitcoins; many also produce other altcoins like Ethereum, Dash, Monero and Zcash. There are three ways to mine Bitcoin. First is solo mining which entails using computer resources and applying brute force to find Bitcoins on its own \\u2013 this can take a long time to generate any significant income. Second is pool mining which means working together with others in a pool where the reward can vary depending on how much work has been done by each miner but on average generates around 1 BTC per month - however there are hidden costs associated with running hardware 24/7 which may not make it profitable.  Trading cryptocurrency for profit  The easiest way to trade cryptocurrency is through an online exchange, such as Coinbase. Once you have opened your account and connected it to your bank account, you can start buying and selling currencies. It's important to note that the price of Bitcoin will fluctuate constantly, so don't go in with all of your savings! If you want to trade cryptocurrency for profit, make sure you are constantly monitoring the market for opportunities. For example, if you notice that one currency has been dropping steadily over a few days but another has been slowly rising then this could be a good opportunity to buy into the latter currency. You may not get rich quick with this method, but if done right it can lead to some decent profits over time.  Check Out How To Get Rich With Bitcoin Even If You Have No Clue About Technology.
